4," It had been with a gentle sorrow that Etheldred had expected to go and lay in her resting-place, the little niece, who had been kept from the evil of the world, in a manner of which she had little dreamt. Poor Flora! she must be ennobled, she thought, by having a child where hers is, when she is able to feel anything but the first grief; and Ethel’s heart yearned to be trying, at least, to comfort her, and to be with her father, who had loved his grandchild so fondly.",gentle sorrow expect go lay resting place little niece keep evil world manner have little dreamt poor flora ennobl think have child able feel first grief heart yearn try least comfort father love grandchild 
5,"It was not to be. Margaret had borne so many shocks with such calmness, that Ethel had no especial fears for her; but there are some persons who have less fortitude for others than for themselves, and she was one of these. Ethel had been her own companion-sister, and the baby had been the sunbeam of her life, during the sad winter and spring.",borne many shock such calmness have especial fear be person have less fortitude other own companion sister baby sunbeam life sad winter spring 
6,"In the middle of the night, Ethel knocked at Richard’s door. Margaret had been seized with faintness, from which they could not bring her back; and, even when Richard had summoned Dr. Spencer, it was long ere his remedies took effect; but, at last, she revived enough to thank them, and say she was glad that papa was not there.",middle night knock door seize faintness bring summon long remedy take effect last revive thank say glad papa 
7,"Dr. Spencer sent them all to bed, and the rest of the night was quiet; but Margaret could not deny, in the morning, that she felt terribly shattered, and she was depressed in spirits to a degree such as they had never seen in her before. Her whole heart was with Flora; she was unhappy at being at a distance from her, almost fretfully impatient for letters, and insisting vehemently on Ethel’s going to London.",send bed rest night quiet deny morning feel shattered depressed spirit degree such see whole heart unhappy distance impatient letter insist go 
8,"Ethel had never felt so helpless and desolate, as with Margaret thus changed and broken, and her father absent.",feel helpless desolate change break father absent 
9,"“My dear,” said Dr. Spencer, “nothing can be better for both parties than that he should be away. If he were here, he ought to leave all attendance to me, and she would suffer from the sight of his distress.”",dear say good party leave attendance suffer sight distress 
10,“I cannot think what he will do or feel!” sighed Ethel.,think do feel sigh 
11,"“Leave it to me. I will write to him, and we shall see her better before post time.”",leave write see good post time 
12,"“You will tell him exactly how it was, or I shall,” said Ethel abruptly, not to say fiercely.",tell say say 
13,"“Ho! you don’t trust me?” said Dr. Spencer, smiling, so that she was ashamed of her speech. “You shall speak for yourself, and I for myself; and I shall say that nothing would so much hurt her as to have others sacrificed to her.”",trust say smile ashamed speech speak say hurt have other sacrifice 
14,"“That is true,” said Ethel; “but she misses papa.”",true say misse papa

22,"Dr. Spencer was glad to have dismissed Ethel smiling; and she was the better able to bear with poor Margaret’s condition of petulance. She had never before experienced the effects of bodily ailments on the temper, and she was slow to understand the change in one usually so patient and submissive. She was, by turns, displeased with her sister and with her own abruptness; but, though she knew it not, her bluntness had a bracing effect. She thought she had been cross in declaring it was nonsense to harp on her going to London; but it made Margaret feel that she had been unreasonable, and keep silence.",glad dismiss smile good able bear poor condition petulance experience effect bodily ailment temper slow understand change patient submissive turn displease sister own abruptness know bluntness have brace effect think cross declare nonsense harp go make feel unreasonable keep silence 
23,"Richard managed her much better, being gentle and firm, and less ready to speak than Ethel, and he succeeded in composing her into a sleep, which restored her balance, and so relieved Ethel, that she not only allowed Dr. Spencer to say what he pleased, but herself made light of the whole attack, little knowing how perilous was any shock to that delicate frame.",manage good gentle firm ready speak succeed compose sleep restore balance relieve allow say pleased make light whole attack little know perilous shock delicate frame 
24,"Margaret’s whole purpose was to wind herself up for the first interview with Flora; and though she had returned to her usual state, she would not go downstairs on the evening the party were expected, believing it would be more grateful to her sister’s feelings to meet her without witnesses.",whole purpose wind first interview return usual state go evening party expect believe grateful sister feeling meet witness 
25,"The travellers arrived, and Dr. May hurried up to her. She barely replied to his caresses and inquiries in her eagerness to hear of Flora, and to convince him that he must not forbid the meeting. Nor had he any mind so to do. “Surely,” said he, when he had seen the spiritualised look of her glistening blue eyes, the flush on her transparent cheeks, and her hands clasped over her breast--“surely poor Flora must feel as though an angel were waiting to comfort her.”",traveller arrive hurry reply caresse inquiry eagerness hear convince forbid meeting have mind do say see spiritualised look glisten blue eye flush transparent cheek hand clasp breast poor feel angel wait comfort 
26,"Flora came, but there was sore disappointment. Fond and tender she was as ever, but, neither by word or gesture, would she admit the most remote allusion to her grief. She withdrew her hand when Margaret’s pressure became expressive; she avoided her eye, and spoke incessantly of different subjects. All the time, her voice was low and hollow, her face had a settled expression of wretchedness, and her glances wandered drearily and restlessly anywhere but to Margaret’s face; but her steadiness of manner was beyond her sister’s power to break, and her visit was shortened on account of her husband. Poor George had quite given way at the sight of Gertrude, whom his little girl had been thought to resemble; and, though Dr. May had soothed him almost like a child, no one put any trust in his self-control, and all sat round, fearing each word or look, till Flora came downstairs, and they departed.",come be sore disappointment fond tender word gesture admit remote allusion grief withdraw hand pressure become expressive avoid eye speak different subject time voice low hollow face have settle expression wretchedness glance wander face steadiness manner sister power break visit shorten account husband poor give way sight little girl think resemble sooth child put trust self control sit fear word look come depart 
27,"Richard and Ethel each offered to go with them; they could not bear to think of their spending that first evening in their childless home; but Flora gently, but decidedly, refused; and Dr. May said that, much as he wished to be with them, he believed that Flora preferred having no one but Meta. “I hope I have done Margaret no harm,” were Flora’s last words to him, and they seemed to explain her guarded manner; but he found Margaret weeping as she had never wept for herself, and palpitation and faintness were the consequence.",offer go bear think spending first evening childless home refuse say much wish believe prefer have hope do harm last word seem explain guard manner find weep goot palpitation faintness consequence 
28,"Ethel looked on at Flora as a sad and perplexing mystery during the weeks that ensued. There were few opportunities of being alone together, and Flora shrank from such as they were--nay, she checked all expression of solicitude, and made her very kisses rapid and formal.",look sad perplexing mystery week ensue be few opportunity alone shrank such check expression solicitude make kisse rapid formal 
29,"The sorrow that had fallen on the Grange seemed to have changed none of the usual habits there--visiting, riding, driving, dinners, and music, went on with little check. Flora was sure to be found the animated, attentive lady of the house, or else sharing her husband’s pursuits, helping him with his business, or assisting him in seeking pleasure, spending whole afternoons at the coachmaker’s over a carriage that they were building, and, it was reported, playing ecarte in the evening.",sorrow fall seem change usual habit visit riding drive dinner music go little check sure find animated attentive lady house share husband pursuit help business assist seek pleasure spend whole afternoon coachmaker carriage build report play ecarte evening 
30,"Had grief come to be forgotten and cast aside without effecting any mission? Yet Ethel could not believe that the presence of the awful messenger was unfelt, when she heard poor George’s heavy sigh, or when she looked at Flora’s countenance, and heard the peculiar low, subdued tone of her voice, which, when her words were most cheerful, always seemed to Ethel the resigned accent of despair.",grief come forget cast effect mission believe presence awful messenger unfelt hear poor heavy sigh look countenance hear peculiar low subdued tone voice word cheerful seem resign accent despair 
31,"Ethel could not talk her over with Margaret, for all seemed to make it a point that Margaret should believe the best. Dr. May turned from the subject with a sort of shuddering grief, and said, “Don’t talk of her, poor child--only pray for her!”",talk seem make point believe good turn subject sort shudder grief say talk poor child pray 
32,"Ethel, though shocked by the unwonted manner of his answer, was somewhat consoled by perceiving that a double measure of tenderness had sprung up between her father and his poor daughter. If Flora had seemed, in her girlhood, to rate him almost cheaply, this was at an end now; she met him as if his embrace were peace, the gloom was lightened, the attention less strained, when he was beside her, and she could not part with him without pressing for a speedy meeting. Yet she treated him with the same reserve; since that one ghastly revelation of the secrets of her heart, the veil had been closely drawn, and he could not guess whether it had been but a horrible thought, or were still an abiding impression. Ethel could gather no more than that her father was very unhappy about Flora, and that Richard understood why; for Richard had told her that he had written to Flora, to try to persuade her to cease from this reserve, but that he had no reply.",shocked unwonted manner answer console perceive double measure tenderness spring father poor daughter seem girlhood rate end meet embrace peace gloom lighten attention strain part press speedy meeting treat same reserve ghastly revelation secret heart veil draw guess horrible thought abide impression gather more father unhappy understand tell write try persuade cease reserve have reply 
33,"Norman was not at home; he had undertaken the tutorship of two schoolboys for the holidays; and his father owned, with a sigh, that he was doing wisely.",home undertake tutorship schoolboy holiday father own sigh do 
34,"As to Meta, she was Ethel’s chief consolation, by the redoubled assurances, directed to Ethel’s unexpressed dread, lest Flora should be rejecting the chastening Hand. Meta had the most absolute certainty that Flora’s apparent cheerfulness was all for George’s sake, and that it was a most painful exertion. “If Ethel could only see how she let herself sink together, as it were, and her whole countenance relax, as soon as he was out of sight,” Meta said, “she could not doubt what misery these efforts were to her.”",chief consolation redoubl assurance direct unexpressed dread reject chastening hand have absolute certainty apparent cheerfulness sake painful exertion see let sink whole countenance relax sight say doubt misery effort 
35,“Why does she go on with them?” said Ethel.,go say 
36,"“George,” said Meta. “What would become of him without her? If he misses her for ten minutes he roams about lost, and he cannot enjoy anything without her. I cannot think how he can help seeing what hard work it is, and how he can be contented with those dreadful sham smiles; but as long as she can give him pleasure, poor Flora will toil for him.”",say become misse minute roam lose enjoy think help see hard work content dreadful sham smile give pleasure poor toil 
37,"“It is very selfish,” Ethel caught herself saying.",selfish catch say 
38,"“No, no, it is not,” cried Meta. “It is not that he will not see, but that he cannot see. Good honest fellow, he really thinks it does her good and pleases her. I was so sorry one evening when I tried to take her place at that perpetual ecarte, and told him it teased her; he went so wistfully to her, and asked whether it did, and she exerted herself into such painful enjoyment to persuade him to the contrary; and afterwards she said to me, ‘Let me alone, dearest--it is the only thing left me.’”",cry see see good honest fellow think do good please sorry evening try take place perpetual ecarte tell tease go ask exert such painful enjoyment persuade contrary say let only thing leave 
39,"“There is something in being husband and wife that one cannot understand,” slowly said Ethel, so much in her quaint way that Meta laughed.",be husband wife understand say much quaint way laugh 
40,"Had it not been for Norman’s absence, Ethel would, in the warm sympathy and accustomed manner of Meta Rivers, have forgotten all about the hopes and fears that, in brighter days, had centred on that small personage; until one day, as she came home from Cocksmoor, she found “Sir Henry Walkinghame’s” card on the drawing-room table. “I should like to bite you! Coming here, are you?” was her amiable reflection.",absence warm sympathy accustom manner forget hope fear bright day centre small personage day come find card draw room table like bite come amiable reflection 
41,"Meta, in her riding-habit, peeped out of Margaret’s room. “Oh, Ethel, there you are! It is such a boon that you did not come home sooner, or we should have had to ride home with him! I heard him asking for the Miss Mays! And now I am in hopes that he will go home without falling in with Flora and George.”",riding habit peep room boon come have ride hear ask hope go fall

45,"“I liked him very much in London,” said Meta; “he is pleasant enough to talk to, but somehow, he is not congruous here--if you understand me. And I think his coming oppresses Flora--she turned quite pale when he was announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she spoke to him.”",like say pleasant talk congruous understand think coming oppress turn pale announce voice low speak 
46,“Does he come often?” said Ethel.,come say 
47,"“I don’t think he has anything else to do,” returned Meta, “for our house cannot be as pleasant as it was; but he is very kind to George, and for that we must be grateful. One thing I am afraid of, that he will persuade us off to the yachting after all.”",think have else do return house pleasant kind grateful thing afraid persuade yachting

53,"“Dr. Spencer promises it before Hector’s holidays are over,” said Margaret, blushing, as she always did, with pleasure, when they talked of the church.",promise holiday say blush do pleasure talk church 
54,"Hector Ernescliffe had revived Margaret wonderfully. She was seldom downstairs before the evening, and Ethel thought his habit of making her apartment his sitting-room must be as inconvenient to her as it was to herself; but Hector could not be de trop for Margaret. She exerted herself to fulfil for him all the little sisterly offices that, with her brothers, had been transferred to Ethel and Mary; she threw herself into all his schemes, tried to make him endure Captain Gordon, and she even read his favourite book of Wild Sports, though her feelings were constantly lacerated by the miseries of the slaughtered animals. Her couch was to him as a home, and he had awakened her bright soft liveliness which had been only dimmed for a time.",revive evening think habit make apartment sitting room inconvenient exert fulfil little sisterly office brother transfer throw scheme try make endure read favourite book wild feeling lacerate misery slaughter animal couch home awaken bright soft liveliness dimm time 
55,"The church was her other great interest, and Dr. Spencer humoured her by showing her all his drawings, consulting her on every ornament, and making many a perspective elevation, merely that she might see the effect.",church other great interest humoure show drawing consult ornament make many perspective elevation see effect 
56,"Richard and Tom made it their recreation to construct a model of the church as a present for her, and Tom developed a genius for carving, which proved a beneficial interest to keep him from surliness. He had voluntarily propounded his intended profession to his father, who had been so much pleased by his choice, that he could not but be gratified; though now and then ambitious fancies, and discontent with Stoneborough, combined to bring on his ordinary moody fits, the more, because his habitual reserve prevented any one from knowing what was working in his mind.",make recreation construct model church present develop genius carving prove beneficial interest keep surliness propound intend profession father pleased choice gratified ambitious fancy discontent combine bring ordinary moody fit more habitual reserve prevent one know work mind 
57,"Finally the Rivers’ party announced their intention of going to the Isle of Wight as soon as Meta had come of age; and the council of Cocksmoor, meeting at tea at Dr. May’s house, decided that the foundation stone of the church should be laid on the day after her birthday, when there would be a gathering of the whole family, as Margaret wished. Dr. Spencer had worked incredibly hard to bring it forward, and Margaret’s sweet smiles, and liquid eyes, expressed how personally thankful she felt.",announce intention go come age council meet tea house decide foundation stone church lay day birthday be gathering whole family wish work hard bring sweet smile liquid eye express thankful feel 
58,"“What a blessing this church has been to that poor girl,” said Dr. Spencer, as he left the house with Mr. Wilmot. “How it beguiles her out of her grief! I am glad she has the pleasure of the foundation; I doubt if she will see the consecration.”",blessing church poor girl say leave house beguile grief glad have pleasure foundation doubt see consecration 
59,"“Indeed!” said Mr. Wilmot, shocked. “Was that attack so serious?”",say shocked attack serious 
60,"“That recumbent position and want of exercise were certain to produce organic disease, and suspense and sorrow have hastened it.

Never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the fowls of the air, or the lilies of the field, as it does to dear Dick May,” said Dr. Spencer, his voice faltering.",know be extensive damage think open eye result bear be man come live fowl air lilie field do dear say voice falter 
63,"“There is a strength of faith and love in him that carries him through all,” said Mr. Wilmot. “His childlike nature seems to have the trustfulness that is, in itself, consolation. You said how Cocksmoor had been blessed to Margaret--I think it is the same with them all--not only Ethel and Richard, who have been immediately concerned; but that one object has been a centre and aim to elevate the whole family, and give force and unity to their efforts. Even the good doctor, much as I always looked up to him--much good as he did me in my young days--I must confess that he was sometimes very provoking.”",be strength faith love carry say childlike nature seem have trustfulness consolation say bless think same concerned object centre aim elevate whole family give force unity effort good doctor much look good do young day confess provoking

67,"“One thing was,” said Mr. Wilmot, smiling, “that a man must take himself in hand at some time in his life, and Dr. May only began to think himself responsible for himself when he lost his wife, who was wise for both.

69,"Hitherto the Stoneborough subscribers to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel had been few and far between; but, under the new dynasty, there was a talk of forming an association, and having a meeting to bring the subject forward. Dr. Spencer’s proposal, however, took the vicar by surprise.",subscriber few new dynasty be talk form association have meeting bring subject proposal take vicar surprise

Dr. May threatened him with being displayed on the platform as a living instance of the effects of missions, at which he took alarm, and so seriously declared that he should join the Bucephalus at once, that they pacified him by promising that he should do as he pleased.",meeting decide see person give speechifying young brother declare humbug say wish blackamor creation stand palaver friend threaten display platform living instance effect mission take alarm declare join pacify promise do pleased 
79,"The archdeacon promised a sermon, and the active Dr Spencer worked the nine muses and all the rest of the town and neighbourhood into a state of great enthusiasm and expectation. He went to the Grange, as he said, to collect his artillery; primed Flora that she might prime the M. P.; made the willing Meta promise to entrap the uncle, who was noted for philanthropical speeches; and himself captured Sir Henry Walkinghame, who looked somewhat rueful at what he found incumbent on him as a country gentleman, though there might be some compensation in the eagerness of Miss Rivers.",archdeacon promise sermon active work muse rest town neighbourhood state great enthusiasm expectation go say collect artillery prime prime make willing promise entrap uncle note philanthropical speech capture look rueful find incumbent country gentleman be compensation eagerness 
80,"Norman had hardly set foot in Stoneborough before he was told what was in store for him, and, to the general surprise, submitted as if it were a very simple matter. As Dr. Spencer told him, it was only a foretaste of the penalty which every missionary has to pay for coming to England. Norman was altogether looking much better than when he had been last at home, and his spirits were more even. He had turned his whole soul to the career he had chosen, cast his disappointment behind him, or, more truly, made it his offering, and gathered strength and calmness, with which to set out on tasks of working for others, with thoughts too much absorbed on them, to give way to the propensity of making himself the primary object of study and contemplation. The praise of God, and love of man, were the best cures for tendencies like his, and he had found it out. His calm, though grave cheerfulness, came as a refreshment to those who had been uneasy about him, and mournfully watching poor Flora.",set foot tell store general surprise submit simple matter tell foretaste penalty missionary have pay come look good last home spirit turn whole soul career choose cast disappointment make offering gather strength calmness set task work other thought absorb give way propensity make primary object study contemplation praise love man good cure tendency find calm grave cheerfulness come refreshment uneasy watch poor

82,"Norman coloured, as if he understood more than met the ear. Mary and Blanche were very busy preparing presents for Meta Rivers, and every one was anxious to soften to her the thought of this first birthday without her father. Each of the family contributed some pretty little trifle, choice in workmanship or kind in device, and each was sealed and marked with the initials of the giver, and packed up by Mary, to be committed to Flora’s charge. Blanche had, however, much trouble in extracting a gift from Norman, and he only yielded at last, on finding that all his brothers had sent something, so that his omission would be marked. Then he dived into the recesses of his desk, and himself sealed up a little parcel, of which he would not allow his sisters to inspect the contents.",coloured understand more meet ear busy prepare present one anxious soften thought first birthday father family contribute little trifle choice workmanship kind device seal mark initial giver pack commit charge much trouble extract gift yield last find brother send omission mark dive recesse desk seal little parcel allow sister inspect content 
83,"Ethel had a shrewd guess. She remembered his having, in the flush of joy at Margaret’s engagement, rather prematurely caused a seal to be cut with a daisy, and “Pearl of the meadow” as the motto; and his having said that he should keep it as a wedding present. She could understand that he was willing to part with it without remark.",have shrewd guess remember have flush joy engagement cause seal cut daisy meadow motto say keep wedding present understand willing part remark 
84,"Flora met Meta in her sitting-room, on the morning of the day, which rose somewhat sadly upon the young girl, as she thought of past affection and new responsibilities. If the fondness of a sister could have compensated for what she had lost, Meta received it in no scanty measure from Flora, who begged to call George, because he would be pleased to see the display of gifts.",meet sitting room morning day rise young girl think past affection new responsibility fondness sister compensate lose receive scanty measure begg call pleased see display gift 
85,"His own was the only costly one--almost all the rest were homemade treasures of the greater price, because the skill and fondness of the maker were evident in their construction; and Meta took home the kindness as it was meant, and felt the affection that would not let her feel herself lonely. She only wished to go and thank them all at once.",own only costly one rest homemade treasure great price skill fondness maker evident construction take kindness mean feel affection let feel lonely wish go thank
