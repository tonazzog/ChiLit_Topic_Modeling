1,CHAPTER V. Prisoners and captives.,chapter prisoner captive 
2," It was one day when Mother had gone to Maidbridge. She had gone alone, but the children were to go to the station to meet her. And, loving the station as they did, it was only natural that they should be there a good hour before there was any chance of Mother’s train arriving, even if the train were punctual, which was most unlikely. No doubt they would have been just as early, even if it had been a fine day, and all the delights of woods and fields and rocks and rivers had been open to them. But it happened to be a very wet day and, for July, very cold. There was a wild wind that drove flocks of dark purple clouds across the sky “like herds of dream-elephants,” as Phyllis said. And the rain stung sharply, so that the way to the station was finished at a run. Then the rain fell faster and harder, and beat slantwise against the windows of the booking office and of the chill place that had General Waiting Room on its door.",day mother go go child go station meet love station natural good hour be chance mother train arrive train punctual unlikely doubt early fine day delight wood field rock river open happen wet day cold be wild wind drive flock dark purple cloud sky herd dream elephant say rain st way station finish run rain fall fast hard beat slantwise window booking office chill place have wait door

8,"They went into the desert spot labelled General Waiting Room, and the time passed pleasantly enough in a game of advertisements. You know the game, of course? It is something like dumb Crambo. The players take it in turns to go out, and then come back and look as like some advertisement as they can, and the others have to guess what advertisement it is meant to be. Bobbie came in and sat down under Mother’s umbrella and made a sharp face, and everyone knew she was the fox who sits under the umbrella in the advertisement. Phyllis tried to make a Magic Carpet of Mother’s waterproof, but it would not stand out stiff and raft-like as a Magic Carpet should, and nobody could guess it. Everyone thought Peter was carrying things a little too far when he blacked his face all over with coal-dust and struck a spidery attitude and said he was the blot that advertises somebody’s Blue Black Writing Fluid.",go desert spot label time pass game advertisement know game course dumb player take turn go come look advertisement other have guess advertisement mean come sit umbrella make sharp face know fox sit umbrella advertisement try make waterproof stand stiff raft guess think carry thing little black face coal dust strike spidery attitude say blot advertise blue black 
9,"It was Phyllis’s turn again, and she was trying to look like the Sphinx that advertises What’s-his-name’s Personally Conducted Tours up the Nile when the sharp ting of the signal announced the up train. The children rushed out to see it pass. On its engine were the particular driver and fireman who were now numbered among the children’s dearest friends. Courtesies passed between them. Jim asked after the toy engine, and Bobbie pressed on his acceptance a moist, greasy package of toffee that she had made herself.",turn try look advertise name conduct sharp ting signal announce up train child rush see pass engine particular driver fireman number child dearest friend courtesy pass ask toy engine press acceptance moist greasy package toffee make

The children watched the tail-lights of the train till it disappeared round the curve of the line, and then turned to go back to the dusty freedom of the General Waiting Room and the joys of the advertisement game.",train go child watch tail light train disappear curve line turn go dusty freedom general joy advertisement game 
13,"They expected to see just one or two people, the end of the procession of passengers who had given up their tickets and gone away. Instead, the platform round the door of the station had a dark blot round it, and the dark blot was a crowd of people.",expect see person end procession passenger give ticket go platform door station have dark blot dark blot crowd person

It was evident that something had happened.",run platform get crowd course see damp back elbow person crowd talk evident happen

20,"“Now, then--move along there. I’ll attend to this, if YOU please.”",move attend 
21,"But the crowd did not move. And then came a voice that thrilled the children through and through. For it spoke in a foreign language. And, what is more, it was a language that they had never heard. They had heard French spoken and German. Aunt Emma knew German, and used to sing a song about bedeuten and zeiten and bin and sin. Nor was it Latin. Peter had been in Latin for four terms.",crowd move come voice thrill child speak foreign language more language hear hear french speak german know use sing song bedeuten zeiten bin sin term

25,“It isn’t French!” cried Peter.,french cry

27,"“I don’t know what it is,” said Peter, “but it isn’t French. I know that.” Then he saw what it was that the crowd had for its centre. It was a man--the man, Peter did not doubt, who had spoken in that strange tongue. A man with long hair and wild eyes, with shabby clothes of a cut Peter had not seen before--a man whose hands and lips trembled, and who spoke again as his eyes fell on Peter.",know say french know see crowd have centre man man doubt speak strange tongue man long hair wild eye shabby clothes cut see man hand lip tremble speak eye fall

35,"A few of the more timid or less inquisitive travellers moved slowly and reluctantly away. And Phyllis and Bobbie got near to Peter. All three had been TAUGHT French at school. How deeply they now wished that they had LEARNED it! Peter shook his head at the stranger, but he also shook his hands as warmly and looked at him as kindly as he could. A person in the crowd, after some hesitation, said suddenly, “No comprenny!” and then, blushing deeply, backed out of the press and went away.",few timid inquisitive traveller move get taught school wish learned shake head stranger shake hand look person crowd hesitation say blush back press go

37,"The Station Master took the arm of the stranger, suddenly but not unkindly. But the man wrenched his arm away, and cowered back coughing and trembling and trying to push the Station Master away.",take arm stranger man wrench arm cower cough tremble try push master

41,"Sometimes, in moments of great need, we can do wonderful things--things that in ordinary life we could hardly even dream of doing. Bobbie had never been anywhere near the top of her French class, but she must have learned something without knowing it, for now, looking at those wild, hunted eyes, she actually remembered and, what is more, spoke, some French words. She said:--",moment great need do wonderful thing thing ordinary life dream do top french class learn know look wild hunt eye remember more speak french word say

47,"She pulled him gently towards the inmost sanctuary of the Station Master. The other children followed, and the Station Master shut the door in the face of the crowd, which stood a little while in the booking office talking and looking at the fast closed yellow door, and then by ones and twos went its way, grumbling.",pull inmost sanctuary other child follow shut door face crowd stand little booking office talk look fast close yellow door one two go way grumble

Standing in front of the stranger, she got out the handkerchief and passed it to him so that the others did not see.",unusual piece good fortune have handkerchief pocket uncommon accident handkerchief clean stand front stranger get handkerchief pass other see

58,"They showed him an Italian stamp, and pointed from him to it and back again, and made signs of question with their eyebrows. He shook his head. Then they showed him a Norwegian stamp--the common blue kind it was--and again he signed No. Then they showed him a Spanish one, and at that he took the envelope from Peter’s hand and searched among the stamps with a hand that trembled. The hand that he reached out at last, with a gesture as of one answering a question, contained a RUSSIAN stamp.",show italian stamp point make sign question eyebrow shake head show norwegian stamp common blue kind sign show spanish one take envelope hand search stamp hand tremble hand reach last gesture answer question contain russian stamp

64,"She smiled at him, and he smiled back, a queer crooked smile. And then he coughed again. And the heavy rattling swish of the incoming train swept past, and the Station Master and Peter and Phyllis went out to meet it. Bobbie was still holding the stranger’s hand when they came back with Mother.",smile smile queer crooked smile cough heavy rattling swish incoming train sweep go meet hold stranger hand come mother

72,"She spoke again in French to the Russian, and everyone could see the surprise and pleasure and gratitude in his eyes.

84,"There was a big black trunk in Mother’s room that none of the children had ever seen unlocked. Now, when she had lighted the fire, she unlocked it and took some clothes out--men’s clothes--and set them to air by the newly lighted fire. Bobbie, coming in with more wood for the fire, saw the mark on the night-shirt, and looked over to the open trunk. All the things she could see were men’s clothes. And the name marked on the shirt was Father’s name. Then Father hadn’t taken his clothes with him. And that night-shirt was one of Father’s new ones. Bobbie remembered its being made, just before Peter’s birthday. Why hadn’t Father taken his clothes? Bobbie slipped from the room. As she went she heard the key turned in the lock of the trunk. Her heart was beating horribly. WHY hadn’t Father taken his clothes? When Mother came out of the room, Bobbie flung tightly clasping arms round her waist, and whispered:--",be big black trunk room child see unlock light fire unlock take clothes man clothes set air light fire come more wood fire see mark night shirt look open trunk thing see man clothes name mark shirt name take clothes night shirt new one remember make birthday father take clothes slip room go hear key turn lock trunk heart beat take clothes come room flung clasp arm waist whisper

89,"Later on, when the Russian stranger had been made comfortable for the night, Mother came into the girls’ room. She was to sleep there in Phyllis’s bed, and Phyllis was to have a mattress on the floor, a most amusing adventure for Phyllis. Directly Mother came in, two white figures started up, and two eager voices called:--",russian stranger make comfortable night come girl room sleep bed have mattress floor amusing adventure come white figure start eager voice call

And overseers went behind them with whips--yes, whips--to beat them if they got tired. And some of them went lame, and some fell down, and when they couldn’t get up and go on, they beat them, and then left them to die. Oh, it’s all too terrible!
