2,"SURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by.",be man stockade wave white cloth other person stand 
3,"It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot.",early coldest morning think chill pierce marrow sky bright cloudless top tree shine sun stand lieutenant shadow wade knee deep low white vapour crawl night morass chill vapour take tell poor tale island damp feverish unhealthy spot

7,"""Flag of truce,"" cried Silver.",flag truce cry 
8,"The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to us, ""Doctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.""",captain porch keep way treacherous shot intend turn speak watch lookout take north side watch hand load musket lively man careful

11,This time it was the other man who replied.,time other man reply 
12,"""Cap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,"" he shouted.",sir come board make term shout 
13,"""Cap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?"" cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, ""Cap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!""",cap know cry captain hear add heart promotion 
14,"Long John answered for himself. ""Me, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir""--laying a particular emphasis upon the word ""desertion."" ""We're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.""",long answer sir poor lad choose cap desertion sir lay particular emphasis word desertion willing submit come term bone ask word let safe sound stockade minute get shot gun fire 
15,"""My man,"" said Captain Smollett, ""I have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.""",man say have slight desire talk wish talk come be treachery side help 
16,"""That's enough, cap'n,"" shouted Long John cheerily. ""A word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.""",enough cap shout word know gentleman lay 
17,"We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.",see man carry flag truce attempt hold wonderful see cavalier captain answer laugh slap back idea alarm absurd advance stockade throw crutch get leg great vigour skill succeed surmount fence drop other side 
18,"I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand. He was whistling ""Come, Lasses and Lads.""",confess take go slight use sentry desert eastern loophole creep captain seat threshold elbow knee head hand eye fix water bubble old iron kettle sand whistle 
19,"Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom he saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.",silver have terrible hard work get knoll steepness incline thick tree stump soft sand crutch helpless ship stay stick man silence last arrive captain salute handsomest style trick good immense blue coat thick brass button hang low knee fine lace hat set back head 
20,"""Here you are, my man,"" said the captain, raising his head. ""You had better sit down.""",man say captain raise head good sit 
21,"""You ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?"" complained Long John. ""It's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.""",go let cap complain main cold morning sure sir sit sand 
22,"""Why, Silver,"" said the captain, ""if you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!""",say captain have pleased honest man sit galley own do ship cook treat handsome common mutineer pirate go hang 
23,"""Well, well, cap'n,"" returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, ""you'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.""",cap return sea cook sit bidd sand have give hand sweet pretty place have be top morning doctor service happy family manner speak 
24,"""If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,"" said the captain.",have say man say say captain 
25,"""Right you were, Cap'n Smollett,"" replied Silver. ""Dooty is dooty, to be sure. Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last night. I don't deny it was a good lay. Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end. And I'll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook--maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that's why I'm here for terms. But you mark me, cap'n, it won't do twice, by thunder! We'll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum. Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind's eye. But I'll tell you I was sober; I was on'y dog tired; and if I'd awoke a second sooner, I'd 'a caught you at the act, I would. He wasn't dead when I got round to him, not he.""",right reply dooty dooty sure look good lay last night deny good lay handy handspike end deny person shake shake shake term mark cap do thunder have do sentry go ease point rum think sheet wind eye tell sober dog tired awoke second catch act dead get 
26,"""Well?"" says Captain Smollett as cool as can be.",say cool 
27,"All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have guessed it from his tone. As for me, I began to have an inkling. Ben Gunn's last words came back to my mind. I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with.",say riddle guess tone begin have inkling last word come mind begin suppose pay buccaneer visit lay drunk fire reckon glee have enemy deal 
28,"""Well, here it is,"" said Silver. ""We want that treasure, and we'll have it--that's our point! You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon; and that's yours. You have a chart, haven't you?""",say want treasure have point save life reckon have chart 
29,"""That's as may be,"" replied the captain.",reply captain 
30,"""Oh, well, you have, I know that,"" returned Long John. ""You needn't be so husky with a man; there ain't a particle of service in that, and you may lay to it. What I mean is, we want your chart. Now, I never meant you no harm, myself.""",have know return husky man be particle service lay mean want chart mean harm 
31,"""That won't do with me, my man,"" interrupted the captain. ""We know exactly what you meant to do, and we don't care, for now, you see, you can't do it.""",do man interrupt captain know mean do care see do 
32,And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.,captain look proceed fill pipe 
33,"""If Abe Gray--"" Silver broke out.",silver break 
34,"""Avast there!"" cried Mr. Smollett. ""Gray told me nothing, and I asked him nothing; and what's more, I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first. So there's my mind for you, my man, on that.""",cry tell ask more see whole island blow clean water blaze be mind man 
35,"This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down. He had been growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.",little whiff temper seem cool grow nettle pull 
36,"""Like enough,"" said he. ""I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. And seein' as how you are about to take a pipe, cap'n, I'll make so free as do likewise.""",enough say set limit gentleman consider shipshape case about take pipe cap make free do 
37,"And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. It was as good as the play to see them.",fill pipe light man sit smoke while look other face stop tobacco lean spit good play see 
38,"""Now,"" resumed Silver, ""here it is. You give us the chart to get the treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep. You do that, and we'll offer you a choice. Either you come aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I'll give you my affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. Or if that ain't to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. We'll divide stores with you, man for man; and I'll give my affy-davy, as before to speak the first ship I sight, and send 'em here to pick you up. Now, you'll own that's talking. Handsomer you couldn't look to get, now you. And I hope""--raising his voice--""that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to all.""",resume give chart get treasure drop shoot poor seamen stoving head asleep do offer choice come treasure ship give affy davy word honour clap safe fancy hand rough have old score account hazing stay divide store man man give affy davy speak first ship sight send pick own talk handsomer look get hope raise voice hand block house overhaul word speak speak 
39,Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand.,rise seat knock ash pipe palm left hand 
40,"""Is that all?"" he asked.",ask 
41,"""Every last word, by thunder!"" answered John. ""Refuse that, and you've seen the last of me but musket-balls.""",last word thunder answer refuse see last musket ball 
42,"""Very good,"" said the captain. ""Now you'll hear me. If you'll come up one by one, unarmed, I'll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England. If you won't, my name is Alexander Smollett, I've flown my sovereign's colours, and I'll see you all to Davy Jones. You can't find the treasure. You can't sail the ship--there's not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can't fight us--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship's in irons, Master Silver; you're on a lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand here and tell you so; and they're the last good words you'll get from me, for in the name of heaven, I'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you. Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double quick.""",good say captain hear come unarmed engage clap iron take fair trial name fly sovereign colour see find treasure sail ship be man fit sail ship fight get ship iron master silver shore find stand tell last good word get name heaven put bullet back meet lad bundle hand hand quick 
43,Silver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He shook the fire out of his pipe.,face picture eye start head wrath shake fire pipe 
44,"""Give me a hand up!"" he cried.",give hand cry 
45,"""Not I,"" returned the captain.",return captain 
46,"""Who'll give me a hand up?"" he roared.",give hand roar 
47,"Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch. Then he spat into the spring.",man move growl foulest imprecation crawl sand get hold porch hoist crutch spat spring 
48,"""There!"" he cried. ""That's what I think of ye. Before an hour's out, I'll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. Laugh, by thunder, laugh! Before an hour's out, ye'll laugh upon the other side. Them that die'll be the lucky ones.""",cry think hour stove old block house rum puncheon laugh thunder laugh hour laugh other side die lucky one 
49,"And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was helped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees.",dreadful oath stumble plough sand help stockade failure man flag truce disappear instant tree
