3," Blithe and gay was Mr. Bultitude when he opened his eyes on Monday morning and realised his incredible good fortune; in a few hours he would be travelling safely and comfortably home, with every facility for regaining his rights. He chuckled--though his sense of humour was not large--he chuckled, as he lay snugly in bed, to think of Dick's discomfiture on seeing him return so unexpectedly; he began to put it down, quite unwarrantably, to his own cleverness, as having conceived and executed such a stroke of genius as procuring his own expulsion.",gay open eye morning realise incredible good fortune few hour travel facility regain right chuckle sense humour large chuckle lay bed think discomfiture see return begin put own cleverness conceive execute stroke genius procure own expulsion 
4,"He remained in bed until long after the getting-up bell had rung, feeling that his position ensured him perfect impunity in this, and when he rose at length it was in high spirits, and he dressed himself with a growing toleration for things in general, very unlike his ordinary frame of mind. When he had finished his toilet, the Doctor entered the room.",remain bed getting bell rung feel position ensure perfect impunity rise length high spirit dress grow toleration thing general ordinary frame mind finish toilet enter room 
5,"""Bultitude,"" he said gravely, ""before sending you from us, I should like to hear from your own lips that you are not altogether without contrition for your conduct.""",bultitude say send like hear own lip contrition conduct 
6,"Mr. Bultitude considered that such an acknowledgment could not possibly do any harm, so he said--as, indeed, he might with perfect truth--that ""he very much regretted what had passed.""",consider acknowledgment do harm say perfect truth regret pass 
7,"""I am glad to hear that,"" said the Doctor, more briskly, ""very glad; it relieves me from a very painful responsibility. It may not impossibly induce me to take a more lenient view of your case.""",glad hear say glad relieve painful responsibility induce take lenient view case 
8,"""Oh!"" gasped Mr. Bultitude, feeling very uncomfortable all at once.",gasp feel uncomfortable 
9,"""Yes; it is a serious step to ruin a boy's career at its outset by unnecessary harshness. Nothing, of course, can palliate the extreme baseness of your behaviour. Still from certain faint indications in your character of better things, I do not despair even yet (after you have received a public lesson at my hands, which you will never forget) of rearing you to become in time an ornament to the society in which it will be your lot to move. I will not give up in despair--I will persevere a little longer.""",serious step ruin boy career outset unnecessary harshness course palliate extreme baseness behaviour certain faint indication character good thing despair receive public lesson hand forget rear become time ornament society lot move give despair persevere little 
10,"""Thank you!"" Paul faltered, with a sudden sinking sensation.",thank falter sudden sinking sensation 
11,"""Mrs. Grimstone, too,"" said the Doctor, ""has been interceding for you; she has represented to me that a public expression of my view of your conduct, together with a sharp, severe dose of physical pain, would be more likely to effect a radical improvement in your character, and to soften your perverted heart, than if I sent you away in hopeless disgrace, without giving you an opportunity of showing a desire to amend.""",say interceded represent public expression view conduct sharp severe dose physical pain likely effect radical improvement character soften perverted heart send hopeless disgrace give opportunity show desire amend 
12,"""It's--very kind of Mrs. Grimstone,"" said Paul faintly.",kind say 
13,"""Then I hope you will show your appreciation of her kindness. Yes, I will not expel you. I will give you one more chance to retrieve your lost reputation. But, for your own sake, and as a public warning, I shall take notice of your offence in public. I shall visit it upon you by a sound flogging before the whole school at eleven o'clock. You need not come down till then--your breakfast will be sent up to you.""",hope show appreciation kindness expel give more chance retrieve lose reputation own sake public warning take notice offence public visit sound flog whole school o'clock come breakfast send 
14,"Paul made a frantic attempt to dissuade him from his terrible determination. ""Dr. Grimstone,"" he said, ""I--I should much prefer being expelled, if it is all the same to you.""",make frantic attempt dissuade terrible determination say prefer expel same 
15,"""It is not all the same to me,"" said the Doctor. ""This is mere pride and obstinacy, Bultitude; I should do wrong to take any notice of it.""",same say mere pride obstinacy do wrong take notice 
16,"""I--I tell you I have great objection to--to being flogged,"" said Paul eagerly; ""it wouldn't improve me at all; it would harden me, sir,--harden me. I--I cannot allow you to flog me, Dr. Grimstone. I have strong prejudices against the system of corporal punishment. I object to it on principle. Expulsion would make me quite a different being, I assure you; it would reform me--save me--it would indeed.""",tell have great objection flogge say improve hard sir hard allow flog have strong prejudice system corporal punishment object principle expulsion make different being assure reform save 
17,"""So, to escape a little personal inconvenience, you would be content to bring sorrow upon your worthy father's grey head, would you, sir?"" said the Doctor. ""I shall not oblige you in this. Nor, I may add, will your cowardice induce me to spare you in your coming chastisement. I leave you, sir--we shall meet again at eleven!""",escape little personal inconvenience content bring sorrow worthy father grey head sir say oblige add cowardice induce spare come chastisement leave sir meet 
18,"And he stalked out of the room. Perhaps, though he did not admit this even to himself, there were more considerations for commuting the sentence of expulsion than those he had mentioned. Boys are not often expelled from private schools, except for especially heinous offences, and in this case there was no real reason why the Doctor should be Quixotic enough to throw up a portion of his income--particularly if he could produce as great a moral effect by other means.",stalked room admit be more consideration commute sentence expulsion mention boy expel private school heinous offence case be real reason quixotic throw portion income produce great moral effect other means 
19,"But his clemency was too much for Mr. Bultitude; he threw himself on the bed and raved at the hideous fate in store for him; ten short minutes ago, and he had been so happy--so certain of release--and now, not only was he as far from all hope of escape as ever, but he had the certainty before him of a sound flogging in less than two hours!",clemency much throw bed rave hideous fate store short minute happy certain release hope escape have certainty sound flog less hour 
20,"Just after something has befallen us which, for good or ill, will make a great change in our lives, what a totally new aspect the common everyday things about us are apt to wear--the book we were reading, the letter we had begun, the picture we knew--what a new and tender attraction they may have for us, or what a grim and terrible irony!",befall good ill make great change life new aspect common everyday thing apt wear book read letter begin picture know new tender attraction have grim terrible irony 
21,"Something of this Paul felt dimly, as he finished dressing, in a dazed, unconscious manner. The comfortable bedroom, with its delicately-toned wall-paper and flowery cretonnes, had become altogether hateful in his eyes now. Instead of feeling grateful (as he surely ought to have been) for the one night of perfect security and comfort he had passed there, he only loathed it for the delusive peace it had brought him.",feel finish dress dazed unconscious manner comfortable bedroom tone wall paper flowery cretonne become hateful eye feel grateful night perfect security comfort pass loath delusive peace bring 
22,"There was a gentle tap at the door, and Dulcie came in, bearing a tray with his breakfast, and looking like a little Royalist bearing food to a fugitive Cavalier; though Paul did not quite carry out his share of the simile.",be gentle tap door come bear tray breakfast look little royalist bear food fugitive carry share simile 
23,"""There!"" she said, almost cheerfully; ""I got Mummy to let me take up your breakfast; and there's an egg for you, and muffins.""",say get let take breakfast be egg muffin 
24,Mr. Bultitude sat on a chair and groaned.,sit chair groan 
25,"""You might say 'thank you,'"" said Dulcie, pouting. ""That other girl wouldn't have brought you up much breakfast if she'd been in my place. I was going to tell you that I'd forgiven you, because very likely you never meant her to write to you"" (Dulcie had not been told the sequel to the Davenant episode, which was quite as well for Paul). ""But you don't seem to care whether I do or not.""",say thank say pout other girl bring much breakfast place go tell forgive likely mean write tell sequel episode seem care do 
26,"""I feel so miserable!"" sighed Paul.",feel miserable sigh 
27,"""Then you must drink some coffee,"" prescribed Dulcie decidedly; ""and you must eat some breakfast. I brought an egg on purpose; it's so strengthening, you know.""",drink coffee prescribe eat breakfast bring egg purpose strengthen know 
28,"""Don't!"" cried Paul, with a short howl of distress at this suggestion. ""Don't talk about the--the flogging, I can't bear it.""",cry short howl distress suggestion talk flog bear 
29,"""But it's not papa's _new_ cane, you know, Dick,"" said Dulcie consolingly. ""I've hidden that; it's only the old one, and you always said that didn't hurt so very much, after a little while. It isn't as if it was the horsewhip, either. Daddy lost that out riding in the holidays.""",papa _new_ cane know say hide old one say hurt little while horsewhip lose ride holiday 
30,"""Oh, the horsewhip's worse, is it?"" said Paul, with a sickly smile.",horsewhip bad say sickly smile 
31,"""Tom says so,"" said Dulcie. ""After all, Dick, it will be all over in five minutes, or, perhaps, a little longer, and I do think you oughtn't to mind that so much, now, after mamma and I have begged you off from being expelled. We might never have seen one another again, Dick!""",say say minute little think mind much mamma begg expel see

34,"""You've done a very cruel thing,"" said Paul. ""For such a little girl as you are, you've done an immense amount of mischief. But for you, that letter would not have been found out. You need not have spoilt my only chance of getting out of this horrible place!""",do cruel thing say little girl do immense amount mischief letter find spoil only chance get horrible place 
35,"Dulcie set down the tray, and, putting her hands behind her, leaned against a corner of a wardrobe.",set tray put hand learn corner wardrobe 
36,"""And is that all you say to me!"" she said, with a little tremble in her voice.",say say little tremble voice 
37,"""That is all,"" said Paul. ""I've no doubt you meant well, but you shouldn't have interfered. All this has come upon me through that. Take away the breakfast. It makes me ill even to look at it.""",say have doubt mean interfer come take breakfast make ill look 
38,"Dulcie shook out her long brown hair, and clenched her small fist in an undeniable passion, for she had something of her father's hot temper when roused. ""Very well, then,"" she said, moving with great dignity towards the door. ""I'm very sorry I ever did interfere. I wish I'd let you be sent home to your papa, and see what he'd do to you. But I'll never, never interfere one bit with you again. I won't say one single word to you any more.... I'll never even look at you if you want me to ever so much.... I shall tell Tipping he can hit you as much as ever he likes, and I shall show Tom where I put the new cane--and I only hope it will hurt!""

39,"Mr. Bultitude wandered disconsolately about the upper part of the house after this, not daring to go down, and not able to remain in any one place. The maids who came up to make the beds looked at him with pitiful interest, but he was too proud to implore help from them. To hide would only make matters worse, for, as he had not a penny in his pocket, and no probability of being able to borrow one, he must remain in the house till hunger forced him from his hiding-place--supposing they did not hunt him out long before that time.",wander upper part house dare go able remain place maid come make bed look pitiful interest proud implore help hide make matter bad have penny pocket probability able borrow remain house hunger force hiding place suppose hunt time 
40,"The shouts of the boys in the playground during their half-hour's play had long since died away; he heard the clock in the hall strike eleven--time for him to seek his awful rendezvous. The Doctor had not forgotten him, he found, for presently the butler came up and ceremoniously announced that the Doctor ""would see him now, if he pleased.""",shout boy playground half hour play die hear clock hall strike time seek awful rendezvous forget find butler come announce see pleased 
41,"He stumbled downstairs in a half-unconscious condition, the butler threw open the two doors which led to the schoolroom, and Paul tottered in, more dead than alive with shame and fear.",stumble half unconscious condition butler throw open door lead schoolroom totter dead alive shame fear 
42,"The whole school were at their places, with no books before them, and arranged as if to hear a lecture. Mr. Blinkhorn alone was absent, for, not liking these exhibitions, he had taken an opportunity of slipping out into the playground, round which he was now solemnly trotting at the ""double"" with elbows squared and head up; an exercise which he said was an excellent thing for the back and lungs. He had a habit of suddenly leaving the class he was taking to indulge in it for a few minutes, returning breathless but refreshed.",whole school place book arrange hear lecture absent like exhibition take opportunity slip playground trot double elbow square head exercise say excellent thing back lung have habit leave class take indulge few minute return breathless refresh 
43,"Mr. Tinkler was at his seat, wearing that faint grin on his face with which he might have prepared to see a pig killed or a bull-fight, and all the boys fixed their eyes expectantly on Mr. Bultitude as he appeared at the doorway.",seat wear faint grin face prepare see pig kill bull fight boy fix eye appear doorway 
44,"""Stand there, sir,"" said the Doctor, who was standing at his writing-table in an attitude; ""out there in the middle, where your schoolfellows can see you."" Paul obeyed and stood where he was told, looking, as he felt, absolutely boneless.",stand sir say stand writing table attitude middle schoolfellow see obey stand tell look feel boneless 
45,"""Some of those here,"" began the Doctor in an impressive bass, ""may wonder why I have called you all together on this, the first day of the week; most of those who reside under my roof are acquainted with, and I trust execrate, the miserable cause of my doing so.",begin impressive bass wonder call first day week most reside roof acquainted trust miserable cause do

47,"""With the majority I have, I hope, been successful, and it is as painful for me to tell as for you to hear, that there exists in your midst a youthful reprobate, trained in all the arts of ensnaring the vagrant fancies of innocent but giddy girlhood.",majority hope successful painful tell hear exist midst youthful reprobate train art ensnare vagrant fancy innocent giddy girlhood 
48,"""See him as he cowers there before your gaze, in all the bared hideousness of his moral depravity"" (the Doctor on occasions like these never spared his best epithets, and Paul soon began to feel himself a very villain); ""a libertine, young in years, but old in--in everything else, who has not scrupled to indite an amatory note, so appalling in its familiarity, and so outrageous in the warmth of its sentiments, that I cannot bring myself to shock your ears with its contents.",see cower gaze bare hideousness moral depravity occasion spare good epithet begin feel very villain libertine young year old else scruple indite amatory note appalling familiarity outrageous warmth sentiment bring shock ear content

50,"""If,"" continued the Doctor, now allowing his powerful voice to boom to its full compass--""if I can succeed in bringing this coward, this unmanly dallier in a sentiment which the healthy mind of boyhood rejects as premature, to a sense of his detestable conduct; if I can score the lesson upon his flesh so that some faint notion of its force and purport may be conveyed to what has been supplied to him as a heart, then I shall not have lifted this hand in vain!",continue allow powerful voice boom full compass succeed bring coward unmanly dallier sentiment healthy mind boyhood reject premature sense detestable conduct score lesson flesh faint notion force purport convey supply heart lift hand vain

53,"With these awful words the Doctor left the room, leaving Paul in a state of abject horror and dread which need not be described. Never, never again would he joke, as he had been wont to do with Dick in lighter moods, on the subject of corporal punishment under any circumstances--it was no fit theme for levity; if this--this outrage were really done to him, he could never be able to hold up his head again. What if it were to get about in the city!",awful word leave room leave state abject horror dread describe joke wont do light mood subject corporal punishment circumstance fit theme levity outrage do able hold head get city

55,"""He's gone to fetch his cane,"" said some, and imitated for Paul's instruction the action of caning by slapping a ruler upon a copy-book with a dreadful fidelity and resonance; others sought to cross-examine him upon the love-letter, it appearing from their casual remarks that not a few had been also honoured by communications from the artless Miss Davenant.",go fetch cane say imitate instruction action caning slap ruler copy book dreadful fidelity resonance other seek cross-examine love letter appear casual remark few honoure communication artless

58,"And still the Doctor lingered. Some kindly suggested that he was ""waxing the cane."" But the more general opinion was that he had been detained by some visitor; for it appeared that (though Paul had not noticed it) several had heard a ring at the bell. The suspense was growing more and more unbearable.",linger suggest wax cane general opinion detain visitor appear notice several hear ring bell suspense grow unbearable 
59,"At last the door opened in a slow ominous manner, and the Doctor appeared. There was a visible change in his manner, however. The white heat of his indignation had died out: his expression was grave but distinctly softened--and he had nothing in his hand.",last door open slow ominous manner appear be visible change manner white heat indignation die expression grave soften have hand

63,"""I have not seen him yet,"" said the Doctor. ""He has come at a most inopportune moment"" (here Mr. Bultitude could _not_ agree with him).

I know how it will wring his paternal heart!"" and the Doctor shook his head sadly, and turned away.",see say come inopportune moment agree allow meet give opportunity break conduct know wring paternal heart shake head turn

The final duel must be fought out between them here. Who would be the victor?",curious mixture shame anger impatience turn handle dining room door meet face face more final duel fight victor 
65,"It was a strange sensation on entering to see the image of what he had so lately been standing by the mantelpiece. It gave a shock to his sense of his own identity. It seemed so impossible that that stout substantial frame could really contain Dick. For an instant he was totally at a loss for words, and stood pale and speechless in the presence of his unprincipled son.",strange sensation enter see image stand mantelpiece give shock sense own identity seem impossible stout substantial frame contain instant loss word stand pale speechless presence unprincipled son

67,"As Paul looked he saw distinctly that his son's fraudulent imitation of his father's personal appearance had become deteriorated in many respects since that unhappy night when he had last seen it. It was then a copy, faultlessly accurate in every detail. It was now almost a caricature, a libel!",look see son fraudulent imitation father personal appearance become deteriorate many respect unhappy night see copy accurate detail caricature libel 
68,"The complexion was nearly sallow, with the exception of the nose, which had rather deepened in colour. The skin was loose and flabby, and the eyes dull and a little bloodshot. But perhaps the greatest alteration was in the dress. Dick wore an old light tweed shooting-coat of his, and a pair of loose trousers of blue serge; while, instead of the formally tied black neckcloth his father had worn for a quarter of a century, he had a large scarf round his neck of some crude and gaudy colour; and the conventional chimney-pot hat had been discarded for a shabby old wide-brimmed felt wideawake.",complexion sallow exception nose deepen colour skin loose flabby eye dull little bloodshot great alteration dress wear old light tweed shooting coat pair loose trousers blue serge tie black neckcloth father wear quarter century have large scarf neck crude gaudy colour conventional chimney pot hat discard shabby old wide brimm feel wideawake
