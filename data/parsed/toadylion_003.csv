1,CHAPTER III. HOW HUGH JOHN BECAME GENERAL NAPOLEON.,became general 
2," Even dull Betty had heard the music. The White Gate was open, and with a wild cry Hugh John sprang through. Betty had a son in the army, and her deaf old ears were quickened by the fife and drum.",dull hear music white open wild cry spring have son army deaf old ear quicken fife drum 
3,"""Come back, Master Hugh!"" she cried, as he passed through and stood on the roadside, just as the head of the column, marching easily, turned the corner of the White Road and came dancing and undulating towards him. Hugh John's heart danced also. It was still going fast with running so far; but at sight of the soldiers it took a new movement, just like little waves on a lake when they jabble in the wind, so nice and funny when you feel it--tickly too--down at the bottom of your throat.",come cry pass stand roadside head column march turn corner white come dance undulate heart dance go run sight soldier take new movement little wave lake jabble wind nice funny feel bottom throat 
4,"The first who came were soldiers in a dark uniform with very stern, bearded officers, who attended finely to discipline, for they were about to enter the little town of Edam, which lay just below the white gates of Windy Standard.",first come soldier dark uniform stern bearded officer attend discipline about enter little town lay white gate windy 
5,"So intently they marched that no one cast a glance at Hugh John standing with his drawn sword, giving the salute which his friend Sergeant Steel had taught him as each company passed. Not that Hugh John cared, or even knew that they did not see him. They were the crack volunteer regiment of the Grey City beyond the hills, and their standard of efficiency was something tremendous.",march cast glance stand draw sword give salute friend teach company pass care know see crack volunteer regiment hill standard efficiency tremendous 
6,"Then came red-coats crowned with helmets, red-coats tipped with Glengarry bonnets, and one or two brass bands of scattering volunteer regiments. Hugh John saluted them all. No one paid the least attention to him. He did not indeed expect any one to notice him--a small dusty boy with a sword too big for him standing at the end of the road under the shadow of the elms. Why should these glorious creations deign to notice him--shining blades, shouldered arms, flashing bayonets, white pipe-clayed belts? Were they not as gods, knowing good and evil?",come red coat crown helmet red coat tip bonnet brass band scatter volunteer regiment salute pay least attention expect one notice small dusty boy sword big stand end road shadow elm glorious creation de notice shine blade shoulder arm flash bayonet white pipe clay belt god know good evil 
7,"But all the same he saluted every one of them impartially as they came, and the regiments swung past unregarding, dust-choked, and thirsty.",same salute come regiment swing unregarding dust choke thirsty 
8,"Then at last came the pipes and the waving tartans. Something cracked in Hugh John's throat, and he gave a little cry, so that his old nurse, Janet Sheepshanks, anxious for his welfare, came to take him away. But he struck at her--his own dear Janet--and fled from her grasp to the other side of the road, where he was both safer and nearer to the soldiers. Swinging step, waving plumes, all in review order on came the famous regiment, every man stepping out with a trained elasticity which went to the boy's heart. Thus and not otherwise the Black Watch followed their pipers. Hugh John gave a long sigh when they had passed, and the pipes dulled down the dusky glade.",last come pipe wave tartan crack throat give little cry old nurse anxious welfare come take strike own dear flead grasp other side road safe nearer soldier swing step wave plume review order come famous regiment man step train elasticity go boy heart black follow piper give long sigh pass pipe dull dusky glade 
9,"Then came more volunteers, and yet more and more. Would they never end? And ever the sword of Hugh John Picton flashed to the salute, and his small arm waxed weary as it rose and fell.",come more volunteer more more end sword flash salute small arm wax weary rise fall 
10,"Then happened the most astonishing thing in the world, the greatest event of Hugh John's life. For there came to his ear a new sound, the clatter of cavalry hoofs. A bugle rang out, and Hugh John's eyes watched with straining eagerness the white dust rise and swirl behind the columns. Perhaps--who knows?--this was his reward for not being dasht-mean! But now Hugh John had forgotten Prissy and Toady Lion, father and nurse alike, heaven, earth--and everything else. There was no past for him. He was the soldier of all time. His dusty red coat and his flashing sword were the salute of the universal spirit of man to the god of war--also other fine things of which I have no time to write.",happen astonish thing world great event life come ear new sound clatter cavalry hoof bugle ring eye watch strain eagerness white dust rise swirl column know reward dasht mean forget prissy father nurse alike heaven earth else be past soldier time dusty red coat flash sword salute universal spirit man god war other fine thing have time write 
11,"For the noble grey horses, whose predecessors Napoleon had watched so wistfully at Waterloo, came trampling along, tossing their heads with an obvious sense of their own worth as a spectacle. Hugh John paled to the lips at sight of them, but drew himself more erect than ever. He had seen foot-soldiers and volunteers before, but never anything like this.",noble grey horse predecessor watch come trample toss head obvious sense own worth spectacle pale lip sight draw erect see foot soldier volunteer 
12,"On they came, a fine young fellow leading them, sitting carelessly on the noblest charger of all. Perhaps he was kindly by nature. Perhaps he had a letter from his sweetheart in his breastpocket. Perhaps--but it does not matter, at any rate he was young and happy, as he sat erect, leading the ""finest troop in the finest regiment in the world."" He saw the small dusty boy in the red coat under the elm-trees. He marked his pale twitching face, his flashing eye, his erect carriage, his soldierly port. The fate of Hugh John stood on tiptoe. He had never seen any being so glorious as this. He could scarce command himself to salute. But though he trembled in every limb, and his under lip ""wickered"" strangely, the hand which held the sword was steady, and went through the beautiful movements of the military salute which Sergeant Steel of the Welsh Fusiliers had taught him, with exactness and decorum.",come fine young fellow lead sit noblest charge nature have letter sweetheart breastpocket matter rate young happy sit erect lead fine troop fine regiment world see small dusty boy red coat elm tree mark pale twitching face flash eye erect carriage soldierly port fate stand tiptoe see glorious scarce command salute tremble limb lip wicker hand hold sword steady go beautiful movement military salute welsh teach exactness decorum 
13,"The young officer smiled. His own hand moved to the response almost involuntarily, as if Hugh John had been one of his own troopers.",young officer smile own hand move response own trooper 
14,The boy's heart stood still. Could this thing be? A real soldier had saluted him!,boy heart stand thing real soldier salute 
15,"But there was something more marvellous yet to come. A sweet spring of good deeds welled up in that young officer's breast. Heaven speed him (as doubtless it will) in his wooing, and make him ere his time a general, with the Victoria Cross upon his breast. But though (as I hope) he rise to be Commander-in-Chief, he will never do a prettier action than that day, when the small grimy boy stood under the elm-trees at the end of the avenue of Windy Standard. This is what he did. He turned about in his saddle.",be marvellous come sweet spring good deed well young officer breast heaven speed woo make time general breast hope rise commander do pretty action day small grimy boy stand elm tree end avenue windy turn saddle 
16,"[""IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER DONE FOR A FIELD-MARSHAL.""]",do field marshal 
17,"""_Attention, men, draw swords!_"" he cried, and his voice rang like a trumpet, so grand it was--at least so Hugh John thought.",_attention man draw sword cry voice ring trumpet grand least think 
18,"There came a glitter of unanimous steel as the swords flashed into line. The horses tossed their heads at the stirring sound, and jingled their accoutrements as the men gathered their bridle reins up in their left hands.",come glitter unanimous steel sword flash line horse toss head stir sound jingle accoutrement man gather bridle rein left hand 
19,"""_Eyes right! Carry swords!_"" came again the sharp command.",teye right carry sword come sharp command 
20,And every blade made an arc of glittering light as it came to the salute. It could not have been better done for a field-marshal.,blade make arc glitter light come salute do field marshal 
21,No fuller cup of joy was ever drunk by mortal. The tears welled up in Hugh John's eyes as he stood there in the pride of the honour done to him. To be knighted was nothing to this. He had been acknowledged as a soldier by the greatest soldier there. Hugh John did not doubt that this glorious being was he who had led the Greys in the charge at Waterloo. Who else could have done that thing?,fuller cup joy drunk mortal tear well eye stand pride honour do knight acknowledge soldier great soldier doubt glorious being lead charge do thing 
22,"He was no longer a little dusty boy. He stood there glorified, ennobled. The world was almost too full.",little dusty boy stand glorify ennobl world full 
23,"""_Eyes front! Slope swords!_"" rang the words once more.",teye front slope sword ring word more 
24,"The pageant passed by. Only the far drum-throb came back as he stood speechless and motionless, till his father rode up on his way home, and seeing the boy asked him what he was doing there. Then for all reply a little clicking hitch came suddenly in his throat. He wanted to laugh, but somehow instead the tears ran down his cheeks, and he gasped out a word or two which sounded like somebody else's voice.",pageant pass far drum throb come stand speechless motionless father ride way see boy ask do reply little click hitch come throat want laugh tear run cheek gasp word sound else voice 
25,"""I'm not hurt, father,"" he said, ""I'm not crying. It was only that the Scots Greys saluted me. And I _can't_ help it, father. It goes _tick-tick_ in my throat, and I can't keep it back. But I'm not crying, father! I'm not indeed!""",hurt father say cry salute help father go _tick tick_ throat keep cry father 
26,"Then the stern man gathered the great soldier up and set him across his saddle--for Hugh John was alone, the others having long ago gone back with Janet Sheepshanks. And his father did not say anything, but let him sit in front with the famous sword in his hands which had brought about such strange things. And even thus rode our hero home--Hugh John Picton no more, but rather General Napoleon Smith; nor shall his rank be questioned on any army roster of strong unblenching hearts.",stern man gather great soldier set saddle alone other go father say let sit front famous sword hand bring such strange thing ride hero home rank question army roster strong unblenching heart 
27,"But late that night Hugh John stole down the hushed avenue, his bare feet pattering through the dust which the dew was making cool. He climbed the gate and stood under the elm, with the wind flapping his white nightgown like a battle flag. Then clasping his hands, he took the solemn binding oath of his religion, ""_The Scots Greys saluted me. May I die-and-rot if ever I am dasht-mean again!_""",night steal hushed avenue bare foot patter dust dew make cool climb gate stand elm wind flap white nightgown battle flag clasp hand take solemn binding oath religion salute die rot dasht mean
