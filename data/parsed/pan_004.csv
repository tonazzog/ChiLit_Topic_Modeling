1,CHAPTER 4. THE FLIGHT,chapter flight 
2,"“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”",second right morning 
3,"That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.",tell way bird carry map consult windy corner sight instruction see say come head 
4,"At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.",first companion trust great delight fly waste time circle church spire other tall object way take fancy 
5,"John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.",race get start 
6,They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.,recall contempt think fine fellow able fly room 
7,Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second sea and their third night.,fly sea thought begin disturb think second sea third night 
8,"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.",dark light cold warm feel hungry time pretend have jolly new way feed way pursue bird have food mouth suitable human snatch bird follow snatch go chase other mile part last mutual expression good notice gentle concern seem know odd way get bread butter be other way 
9,"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.",pretend sleepy sleepy danger moment pop fall awful thing think funny 
10,"“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone.",go cry drop stone 
11,"“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.",save save cry look horror cruel sea dive air catch strike sea lovely way do wait last moment feel cleverness interest save human life fond variety sport engross moment cease engage be possibility next time fall let go 
12,"He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.",sleep air fall lie back float least light get blow go fast 
13,"“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing “Follow my Leader.”",polite whisper play follow leader 
14,"“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.",tell stop show say 
15,"When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.",play follow fly water touch shark tail passing street run finger iron rail follow much success show keep look see many tail miss 
16,"“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could we do if he were to leave us!”",nice impress brother do leave 
17,"“We could go back,” Michael said.",go say 
18,“How could we ever find our way back without him?”,find way 
19,"“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.",go say 
20,"“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t know how to stop.”",awful thing have go know stop 
21,"This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.",true forget show stop 
22,"John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.",say bad come bad have do go world time come own window 
23,"“And who is to get food for us, John?”",get food 
24,"“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”",nip bit eagle mouth 
25,"“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand.”",twentieth try remind become good pick food see bump cloud thing give hand 
26,"Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael’s forehead by this time.",bump fly kick much see cloud front more try avoid bump have bandage forehead time 
27,"Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.",moment feel lonely go fast shoot sight have adventure have share come laugh funny say star forget come mermaid scale stick able say certain happen irritating child see mermaid 
28,"“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect that he will go on remembering us?”",forget argue expect go remember 
29,"Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.",return remember least sure see recognition come eye about pass time day go have call name 
30,"“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.",say 
31,"He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll remember.”",sorry say whisper see forget keep say remember 
32,"Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.",course unsatisfactory make amend show lie flat strong wind go way pleasant change try several time find sleep security sleep tired sleep cry captain voice get occasional tiff whole rollicking draw many moon reach more go straight time ow guidance island look one sight magic shore 
33,"“There it is,” said Peter calmly.",say 
34,"“Where, where?”",
35,“Where all the arrows are pointing.”,arrow point 
36,"Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all directed by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their way before leaving them for the night.",golden arrow point child direct friend sun want sure way leave night 
37,"Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for the holidays.",stand tip toe air get first sight island strange say recognize fear fall hail dreamt see last familiar friend return holiday 
38,"“John, there’s the lagoon.”",be lagoon

45,"“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”",burn boat 
46,"“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin camp!”",rate say see smoke redskin camp

48,"“There, just across the Mysterious River.”",mysterious 
49,"“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”",see war path 
50,"Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anon fear fell upon them?",little annoyed know much want lord triumph hand tell anon fear fall 
51,"It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.",come arrow go leave island gloom 
52,"In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little dark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was all make-believe.",old day home begin look little dark threaten bedtime unexplored patch arise spread black shadow move roar beast prey different lose certainty win glad night light like say mantelpiece make believe 
53,"Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment, and where was Nana?",course make believe day real be night light get dark moment 
54,"They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His careless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went through them every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.",fly huddle careless manner go last eye sparkling tingle go time touch body fearsome island fly low tree graze foot horrid visible air progress become slow laboure push way hostile force hang air beat fist 
55,"“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.",want land explain 
56,"“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.",whisper shudder 
57,"But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.",say asleep shoulder waken send front 
58,"Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.",poise air listen hand ear stare eye bright seem bear hole earth do thing go 
59,"His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he said casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”",courage appalling like adventure say like have tea 
60,"Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in gratitude, but the braver John hesitated.",say tea press hand gratitude brave hesitate

66,"Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I always do.”",speak think kill sleep wake kill way do 
67,“I say! Do you kill many?”,say kill many

100,"For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them, and in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.",moment feel eerie fly light distinguish other fly have go circle move halo like point drawback

118,"Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.",agree travel hat carry hand carry hope carry take hat say strike knee fly see lead mischief hate obligation 
119,"In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.",black topper light hide fly silence stillest silence know break distant lap explain wild beast drink ford rasp sound branch tree rub say redskin sharpen knife

130,"Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the other hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and all will be well.”",bad bad other hand good fairy have thing other small have room feeling time allow change complete change present full jealousy say lovely tinkle course understand believe bad word sound kind fly mean follow well 
131,"What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom.",poor do call get mocking echo reply know hate fierce hatred very woman bewilder staggering flight follow doom
