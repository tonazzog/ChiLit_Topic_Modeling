1,CHAPTER V.,
2," Duke Richard of Normandy slept in the room which had been his father's; Alberic de Montemar, as his page, slept at his feet, and Osmond de Centeville had a bed on the floor, across the door, where he lay with his sword close at hand, as his young Lord's guard and protector.",sleep room father page sleep foot have bed floor door lay sword close hand young guard protector 
3,"All had been asleep for some little time, when Osmond was startled by a slight movement of the door, which could not be pushed open without awakening him.  In an instant he had grasped his sword, while he pressed his shoulder to the door to keep it closed; but it was his father's voice that answered him with a few whispered words in the Norse tongue, ""It is I, open.""  He made way instantly, and old Sir Eric entered, treading cautiously with bare feet, and sat down on the bed motioning him to do the same, so that they might be able to speak lower.  ""Right, Osmond,"" he said.  ""It is well to be on the alert, for peril enough is around him--The Frank means mischief!  I know from a sure hand that Arnulf of Flanders was in council with him just before he came hither, with his false tongue, wiling and coaxing the poor child!""",asleep little time startle slight movement door push open awaken instant grasp sword press shoulder door keep close father voice answer few whisper word tongue open make way old enter tread bare foot sit bed motion do same able speak low right say well alert peril mean mischief know sure hand council come false tongue wile coax poor child

5,"""Yes, surely, to carry the boy off with him, and so he trusts doubtless to cut off all the race of Rollo!  I know his purpose is to bear off the Duke, as a ward of the Crown forsooth.

Even if we could draw our Normans together, we should not be more than a dozen men, and what could we do but die?  That we are ready for, if it may not be otherwise, rather than let our charge be thus borne off without a pledge for his safety, and without the knowledge of the states.""",dead body take surprise resistance little avail full french hall court swarm draw more man do die ready let charge borne pledge safety knowledge state

11,"""I know not,"" said Sir Eric, musingly.

12,"""Sir Eric;"" a bare little foot was heard on the floor, and Alberic de Montemar stood before him.  ""I did not mean to listen, but I could not help hearing you.  I cannot fight for the Duke yet, but I could carry a message.""",bare little foot hear floor stand mean listen help hear fight carry message 
13,"""How would that be?"" said Osmond, eagerly.  ""Once out of the Castle, and in Rouen, he could easily find means of sending to the Count.  He might go either to the Convent of St. Ouen, or, which would be better, to the trusty armourer, Thibault, who would soon find man and horse to send after the Count.""",say find means send count go good trusty armourer find man horse send count

19,"""Then,"" added Osmond, ""if it were possible to get the Duke himself out of the castle to-morrow morning.  If I could take him forth by the postern, and once bring him into the town, he would be safe.  It would be only to raise the burghers, or else to take refuge in the Church of Our Lady till the Count came up, and then Louis would find his prey out of his hands when he awoke and sought him.""",add possible get castle morning take postern bring town safe raise burgher else take refuge count come find prey hand awoke seek

24,"The Baron de Centeville repeated his instructions, and then undertook to guard the door, while his son saw Alberic set off on his expedition. Osmond went with him softly down the stairs, then avoiding the hall, which was filled with French, they crept silently to a narrow window, guarded by iron bars, placed at such short intervals apart that only so small and slim a form as Alberic's could have squeezed out between them. The distance to the ground was not much more than twice his own height, and the wall was so covered with ivy, that it was not a very dangerous feat for an active boy, so that Alberic was soon safe on the ground, then looking up to wave his cap, he ran on along the side of the moat, and was soon lost to Osmond's sight in the darkness.",repeat instruction undertake guard door son see set expedition go stair avoid hall fill french creep narrow window guard iron bar place such short interval small slim form squeeze distance ground more own height wall cover ivy dangerous feat active boy safe ground look wave cap run side moat lose sight darkness

26,"Osmond thought this all the better, for he had small trust in Richard's patience and self-command, and thought there was much more chance of getting him unnoticed out of the Castle, if he did not know how much depended on it, and how dangerous his situation was.",think good have small trust patience self command think be more chance get unnoticed know much depend dangerous situation 
27,"When Richard awoke, he was much surprised at missing Alberic, but Osmond said he was gone into the town to Thibault the armourer, and this was a message on which he was so likely to be employed that Richard's suspicion was not excited.  All the time he was dressing he talked about the King, and everything he meant to show him that day; then, when he was ready, the first thing was as usual to go to attend morning mass.",awoke surprise miss say go town armourer message likely employ suspicion excited time dress talk mean show day ready first thing usual go attend morning mass

29,"Osmond turned, as he spoke, along the passage, walking fast, and not sorry that Richard was lingering a little, as it was safer for him to be first.  The postern was, as he expected, guarded by two tall steel-cased figures, who immediately held their lances across the door-way, saying, ""None passes without warrant.""",turn speak passage walk sorry linger little safe first postern expect guard tall steel case figure hold lance door way say pass warrant

31,"""You must bring warrant,"" repeated one of the men-at-arms.  Osmond was beginning to say that he was the son of the Seneschal of the Castle, when Richard came hastily up.  ""What?  Do these men want to stop us?"" he exclaimed in the imperious manner he had begun to take up since his accession.  ""Let us go on, sirs.""",bring warrant repeat man arm begin say son come man want stop exclaim imperious manner begin take accession let go

33,"""The King has given orders that none should pass without warrant,"" was Osmond's answer.  ""We must wait.""",give order pass warrant answer wait

36,"""I tell you I am Duke of Normandy, and I will go where I please in my own city!"" exclaimed Richard, passionately pressing against the crossed staves of the weapons, to force his way between them, but he was caught and held fast in the powerful gauntlet of one of the men-at-arms.  ""Let me go, villain!"" cried he, struggling with all his might.  ""Osmond, Osmond, help!""",tell go own city exclaim press cross stave weapon force way catch hold powerful gauntlet man arm let go villain cry struggle help

39,"Away he rushed to the stairs, Osmond hurrying after him, lest he should throw himself into some fresh danger, or by his loud calls attract the French, who might then easily make him prisoner.  However, on the very first step of the stairs stood Sir Eric, who was too anxious for the success of the attempt to escape, to be very far off.  Richard, too angry to heed where he was going, dashed up against him without seeing him, and as the old Baron took hold of him, began, ""Sir Eric, Sir Eric, those French are villains! they will not let me pass--""",rush stair hurry throw fresh danger loud call attract make prisoner very first step stair stand anxious success attempt escape angry heed go dash see old take hold begin villain let pass

41,"However imperious with others, Richard from force of habit always obeyed Sir Eric, and now allowed himself to be dragged hastily and silently by him, Osmond following closely, up the stairs, up a second and a third winding flight, still narrower, and with broken steps, to a small round, thick-walled turret chamber, with an extremely small door, and loop-holes of windows high up in the tower.  Here, to his great surprise, he found Dame Astrida, kneeling and telling her beads, two or three of her maidens, and about four of the Norman Squires and men-at-arms.",imperious other force habit obey allow drag follow stair second third wind flight narrower break step small round thick wall turret chamber small door loop hole window high tower great surprise find kneel tell bead maiden man arm

44,"""Listen to me, Lord Richard,"" said Sir Eric: ""that smooth-spoken King whose words so charmed you last night is an ungrateful deceiver.  The Franks have always hated and feared the Normans, and not being able to conquer us fairly, they now take to foul means.

57,"Osmond and two of the Normans were, as he spoke, taking their stand on the narrow spiral stair, where there was just room for one man on the step.  Osmond was the lowest, the other two above him, and it would have been very hard for an enemy to force his way past them.",speak take stand narrow spiral stair be room man step low other hard enemy force way 
58,"Osmond could plainly hear the sounds of the steps and voices of the French as they consulted together, and sought for the Duke.

62,"""What would you say?"" replied Osmond, and the head of another Frank appeared.  ""What means all this, my friend?"" was the address.  ""Our King comes as a guest to you, and you received him last evening as loyal vassals.  Wherefore have you now drawn out of the way, and striven to bear off your young Duke into secret places?

65,"At this moment a cry from without arose, so loud as almost to drown the voices of the speakers on the turret stair, a cry welcome to the ears of Osmond, repeated by a multitude of voices, ""Haro!  Haro! our little Duke!""",moment cry arise loud drown voice speaker turret stair cry welcome ear repeat multitude voice little 
66,"It was well known as a Norman shout.  So just and so ready to redress all grievances had the old Duke Rollo been, that his very name was an appeal against injustice, and whenever wrong was done, the Norman outcry against the injury was always ""Ha Rollo!"" or as it had become shortened, ""Haro."" And now Osmond knew that those whose affection had been won by the uprightness of Rollo, were gathering to protect his helpless grandchild.",know shout ready redress grievance old very name appeal injustice wrong do outcry injury become shorten know affection win uprightness gather protect helpless grandchild 
67,"The cry was likewise heard by the little garrison in the turret chamber, bringing hope and joy.  Richard thought himself already rescued, and springing from Fru Astrida, danced about in ecstasy, only longing to see the faithful Normans, whose voices he heard ringing out again and again, in calls for their little Duke, and outcries against the Franks.  The windows were, however, so high, that nothing could be seen from them but the sky; and, like Richard, the old Baron de Centeville was almost beside himself with anxiety to know what force was gathered together, and what measures were being taken.  He opened the door, called to his son, and asked if he could tell what was passing, but Osmond knew as little--he could see nothing but the black, cobwebbed, dusty steps winding above his head, while the clamours outside, waxing fiercer and louder, drowned all the sounds which might otherwise have come up to him from the French within the Castle.  At last, however, Osmond called out to his father, in Norse, ""There is a Frank Baron come to entreat, and this time very humbly, that the Duke may come to the King.""",cry hear little garrison turret chamber bring hope joy think rescue spring dance ecstasy long see faithful voice hear ring call little outcry window high see sky old anxiety know force gather measure take open door call son ask tell pass know little see black cobwebbed dusty step wind head clamour wax fiercer louder drown sound come last call father be come entreat time come

71,"Osmond gave the desired reply, which was carried to the King.

73,"""Here comes the Count,"" said Osmond, opening the door, and admitting a stout, burly man, who seemed sorely out of breath with the ascent of the steep, broken stair, and very little pleased to find himself in such a situation.  The Baron de Centeville augured well from the speed with which he had been sent, thinking it proved great perplexity and distress on the part of Louis.  Without waiting to hear his hostage speak, he pointed to a chest on which he had been sitting, and bade two of his men-at-arms stand on each side of the Count, saying at the same time to Fru Astrida, ""Now, mother, if aught of evil befalls the child, you know your part.

74,"Richard moved forward.  Sir Eric held his hand.  Osmond kept close behind him, and with as many of the men-at-arms as could be spared from guarding Fru Astrida and her hostage, he descended the stairs, not by any means sorry to go, for he was weary of being besieged in that turret chamber, whence he could see nothing, and with those friendly cries in his ears, he could not be afraid.",move hold hand keep many man arm spare guard hostage descend stair means sorry go weary besiege turret chamber see friendly cry ear afraid 
75,"He was conducted to the large council-room which was above the hall. There, the King was walking up and down anxiously, looking paler than his wont, and no wonder, for the uproar sounded tremendous there--and now and then a stone dashed against the sides of the deep window.",conduct large council room hall walk look paler wont wonder uproar sound tremendous stone dash side deep window

""Here am I come in all good will, in memory of my warm friendship with Duke William, to take on me the care of his orphan, and hold council with you for avenging his death, and is this the greeting you afford me?

82,"At a sign from the Count de Harcourt, Sir Eric led Richard forward, and put his hand into the King's.  Louis took him to the window, lifted him upon the sill, and stood there with his arm round him, upon which the shout, ""Long live Richard, our little Duke!"" arose again.  Meantime, the two Centevilles looked in wonder at the old Harcourt, who shook his head and muttered in his own tongue, ""I will do all I may, but our force is small, and the King has the best of it.

91,"Several of the Clergy of the Cathedral presently appeared in procession, bringing with them the book of the Gospels on which Richard had taken his installation oath, with others of the sacred treasures of the Church, preserved in gold cases.  The Priests were followed by a few of the Norman Knights and Nobles, some of the burgesses of Rouen, and, to Richard's great joy, by Alberic de Montemar himself.

92,"The stone table in the middle of the room was cleared, and arranged so as in some degree to resemble the Altar in the Cathedral; then the Count de Harcourt, standing before it, and holding the King's hand, demanded of him whether he would undertake to be the friend, protector, and good Lord of Richard, Duke of Normandy, guarding him from all his enemies, and ever seeking his welfare.  Louis, with his hand on the Gospels, ""swore that so he would.""",stone table middle room clear arrange degree resemble stand hold hand demand undertake friend protector good guard enemy seek welfare hand swore

94,"Then followed the ceremony, which had been interrupted the night before, of the homage and oath of allegiance which Richard owed to the King, and, on the other hand, the King's formal reception of him as a vassal, holding, under him, the two dukedoms of Normandy and Brittany.  ""And,"" said the King, raising him in his arms and kissing him, ""no dearer vassal do I hold in all my realm than this fair child, son of my murdered friend and benefactor--precious to me as my own children, as so on my Queen and I hope to testify.""",follow ceremony interrupt night homage oath allegiance owe other hand formal reception vassal hold dukedom say raise arm kiss dearer vassal hold realm fair child son murder friend benefactor precious own child hope testify

Soon shall the trumpet be sounded, the ban and arriere ban of the realm be called forth, and Arnulf, in the flames of his cities, and the blood of his vassals, shall learn to rue the day when his foot trod the Isle of Pecquigny!  How many Normans can you bring to the muster, Sir Count?""",brave say ready onset traitor cause ward own cause trumpet sound ban arriere ban realm call flame city blood vassal learn rue day foot trod many bring muster count 
97,"""I cannot say, within a few hundreds of lances,"" replied the old Dane, cautiously; ""it depends on the numbers that may be engaged in the Italian war with the Saracens, but of this be sure, Sir King, that every man in Normandy and Brittany who can draw a sword or bend a bow, will stand forth in the cause of our little Duke; ay, and that his blessed father's memory is held so dear in our northern home, that it needs but a message to King Harold Blue-tooth to bring a fleet of long keels into the Seine, with stout Danes enough to carry fire and sword, not merely through Flanders, but through all France.  We of the North are not apt to forget old friendships and favours, Sir King.""",say few hundred lance reply old depend number engage italian war sure man draw sword bend bow stand cause little bless father memory hold dear northern home need message tooth bring fleet long keel stout carry fire sword apt forget old friendship favour 
98,"""Yes, yes, I know the Norman faith of old,"" returned Louis, uneasily, ""but we should scarcely need such wild allies as you propose; the Count of Paris, and Hubert of Senlis may be reckoned on, I suppose.""",know faith old return need such wild ally propose reckon suppose

100,"""I rejoice to see your confidence,"" said Louis.  ""You shall soon hear from me.  In the meantime I must return to gather my force together, and summon my great vassals, and I will, with your leave, brave Normans, take with me my dear young ward.  His presence will plead better in his cause than the finest words; moreover, he will grow up in love and friendship with my two boys, and shall be nurtured with them in all good learning and chivalry, nor shall he ever be reminded that he is an orphan while under the care of Queen Gerberge and myself.""",rejoice see confidence say hear meantime return gather force summon great vassal leave brave take dear young ward presence plead good cause fine word grow love friendship boy nurture good learning chivalry remind orphan care

105,"""Listen, my Lord,"" said the Dane, stooping down and speaking low.  ""The King is resolved to have you away; he has with him the best of his Franks, and has so taken us at unawares, that though I might yet rescue you from his hands, it would not be without a fierce struggle, wherein you might be harmed, and this castle and town certainly burnt, and wrested from us.  A few weeks or months, and we shall have time to draw our force together, so that Normandy need fear no man, and for that time you must tarry with him.""",listen say stoop speak low resolve have have good take unawares rescue hand fierce struggle harm castle town burn wrest few week month have time draw force need fear man time tarry 
106,"""Must I--and all alone?""",
107,"""No, not alone, not without the most trusty guardian that can be found for you.  Friend Eric, what say you?"" and he laid his hand on the old Baron's shoulder.  ""Yet, I know not; true thou art, as a Norwegian mountain, but I doubt me if thy brains are not too dull to see through the French wiles and disguises, sharp as thou didst show thyself last night.""",alone trusty guardian find friend say lay hand old shoulder know true art norwegian mountain doubt brain dull see french wile disguise sharp show last night

110,"""Since you think fit to peril the only hope of all Normandy, I am not the man to hold back my son where he may aid him,"" said old Eric, sadly.

113,"Bernard paid no further attention to him, but, coming forward, required another oath from the King, that Richard should be as safe and free at his court as at Rouen, and that on no pretence whatsoever should he be taken from under the immediate care of his Esquire, Osmond Fitz Eric, heir of Centeville.",pay further attention come require oath safe free court pretence take immediate care heir 
114,"After this, the King was impatient to depart, and all was preparation. Bernard called Osmond aside to give full instructions on his conduct, and the means of communicating with Normandy, and Richard was taking leave of Fru Astrida, who had now descended from her turret, bringing her hostage with her.  She wept much over her little Duke, praying that he might safely be restored to Normandy, even though she might not live to see it; she exhorted him not to forget the good and holy learning in which he had been brought up, to rule his temper, and, above all, to say his prayers constantly, never leaving out one, as the beads of his rosary reminded him of their order.  As to her own grandson, anxiety for him seemed almost lost in her fears for Richard, and the chief things she said to him, when he came to take leave of her, were directions as to the care he was to take of the child, telling him the honour he now received was one which would make his name forever esteemed if he did but fulfil his trust, the most precious that Norman had ever yet received.",impatient depart preparation call give full instruction conduct means communicate take leave descend turret bring hostage goot little pray restore live see exhort forget good holy learning bring rule temper say prayer leave bead rosary remind order own grandson anxiety seem lose fear chief thing say come take leave direction care take child tell honour receive make name esteem fulfil trust precious receive
