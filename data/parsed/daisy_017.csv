4," In a large family it must often happen, that since every member of it cannot ride the same hobby, nor at the same time, their several steeds must sometimes run counter to each other; and so Ethel found it, one morning when Miss Winter, having a bad cold, had given her an unwonted holiday.",large family happen member ride same hobby same time several steed run counter other find morning have bad cold give unwonted holiday 
5,"Mr. Wilmot had sent a large parcel of books for her to choose from for Cocksmoor, but this she could not well do without consultation. The multitude bewildered her, she was afraid of taking too many or too few, and the being brought to these practical details made her sensible that though her schemes were very grand and full for future doings, they passed very lightly over the intermediate ground. The Paulo post fulurum was a period much more developed in her imagination than the future, that the present was flowing into.",send large parcel book choose do consultation multitude bewilder afraid take many few bring practical detail make sensible scheme grand full future doing pass intermediate ground post fulurum period develop imagination future present flow 
6,"Where was her coadjutor, Richard? Writing notes for papa, and not to be disturbed. She had better have waited tranquilly, but this would not suit her impatience, and she ran up to Margaret’s room. There she found a great display of ivy leaves, which Norman, who had been turning half the shops in the town upside down in search of materials, was instructing her to imitate in leather-work--a regular mania with him, and apparently the same with Margaret.",coadjutor write note papa disturb wait suit impatience run room find great display ivy leave turn shop town search material instruct imitate leather work regular mania same 
7,"In came Ethel. “Oh, Margaret, will you look at these ‘First Truths?’ Do you think they would be easy enough? Shall I take some of the Parables and Miracles at once, or content myself with the book about ‘Jane Sparks?’”",come look first truth think easy take content book 
8,"“There’s some very easy reading in ‘Jane Sparks’, isn’t there? I would not make the little books from the New Testament too common.”",be easy reading make little book new common 
9,"“Take care, that leaf has five points,” said Norman.",take care leaf have point say 
10,"“Shall I bring you up ‘Jane Sparks’ to see? Because then you can judge,”  said Ethel.",bring see judge say 
11,"“There, Norman, is that right?--what a beauty! I should like to look over them by-and-by, dear Ethel, very much.”",right beauty like look dear 
12,"Ethel gazed and went away, more put out than was usual with her. “When Margaret has a new kind of fancy work,” she thought, “she cares for nothing else! as if my poor children did not signify more than trumpery leather leaves!” She next met Flora.",gaze go put usual have new kind fancy work think care else poor child signify more trumpery leather leave meet 
13,"“Oh, Flora, see here, what a famous parcel of books Mr. Wilmot has sent us to choose from.”",see famous parcel book send choose 
14,"“All those!” said Flora, turning them over as they lay heaped on the drawing-room sofa; “what a confusion!”",say turn heap draw room sofa confusion 
15,"“See, such a parcel of reading books. I want to know what you think of setting them up with ‘Jane Sparks’, as it is week-day teaching.”",see parcel reading book want know think set week day teaching 
16,“You will be very tired of hearing those spelled over for ever; they have some nicer books at the national school.”,tired hear spell have nice book national school 
17,“What is the name of them? Do you see any of them here?”,name see 
18,"“No, I don’t think I do, but I can’t wait to look now. I must write some letters. You had better put them together a little. If you were to sort them, you would know what is there. Now, what a mess they are in.”",think wait look write letter have good put little sort know mess 
19,"Ethel could not deny it, and began to deal them out in piles, looking somewhat more fitting, but still felt neglected and aggrieved, at no one being at leisure but Harry, who was not likely to be of any use to her.",deny begin deal pile look fitting feel neglect aggrieved leisure likely use 
20,"Presently she heard the study door open, and hoped; but though it was Richard who entered the room, he was followed by Tom, and each held various books that boded little good to her. Miss Winter had, much to her own satisfaction, been relieved from the charge of Tom, whose lessons Richard had taken upon himself; and thus Ethel had heard so little about them for a long time past, that even in her vexation and desire to have them over, she listened with interest, desirous to judge what sort of place Tom might be likely to take in school.",hear study door open hope enter room follow hold various book bod little good much own satisfaction relieve charge lesson take hear little long time past vexation desire have listen interest desirous judge sort place likely take school 
21,"She did not perceive that this made Richard nervous and uneasy. He had a great dislike to spectators of Latin lessons; he never had forgotten an unlucky occasion, some years back, when his father was examining him in the Georgics, and he, dull by nature, and duller by confusion and timidity, had gone on rendering word for word--enim for, seges a crop, lini of mud, urit burns, campum the field, avenae a crop of pipe, urit burns it; when Norman and Ethel had first warned him of the beauty of his translation by an explosion of laughing, when his father had shut the book with a bounce, shaken his head in utter despair, and told him to give up all thoughts of doing anything--and when Margaret had cried with vexation. Since that time, he had never been happy when any one was in earshot of a lesson; but to-day he had no escape--Harry lay on the rug reading, and Ethel sat forlorn over her books on the sofa. Tom, however, was bright enough, declined his Greek nouns irreproachably, and construed his Latin so well, that Ethel could not help putting in a word or two of commendation, and auguring the third form. “Do let him off the parsing, Ritchie,” said she coaxingly--“he has said it so well, and I want you so much.”",perceive make nervous uneasy have great dislike spectator latin lesson forget unlucky occasion year father examine dull nature duller confusion timidity go rendering word word sege crop lini mud urit burn campum field avenae crop pipe urit burn warn beauty translation explosion laugh father shut book bounce shake head utter despair tell give thought do cry vexation time happy one earshot lesson day have escape lay rug reading sit book sofa bright decline greek noun construe help put word commendation augure third form let parsing say say want much 
22,"“I am afraid I must not,” said Richard; who, to her surprise, did not look pleased or satisfied with the prosperous translation; “but come, Tom, you shan’t have many words, if you really know them.”",afraid say surprise look pleased satisfy prosperous translation come have many word know 
23,"Tom twisted and looked rather cross, but when asked to parse the word viribus, answered readily and correctly.",twist look cross ask parse word viribus answer 
24,"“Very well, only two more--affuit?”",more affuit 
25,"“Third person singular, praeter perfect tense of the verb affo, affis, affui, affere,” gabbled off Tom with such confidence, that though Ethel gave an indignant jump, Richard was almost startled into letting it pass, and disbelieving himself. He remonstrated in a somewhat hesitating voice. “Did you find that in the dictionary?” said he; “I thought affui came from adsum.”",third person singular praeter perfect tense verb affo affis affere gabble such confidence give indignant jump startle let pass disbelieveve remonstrate hesitate voice find dictionary say think affui come adsum 
26,"“Oh, to be sure, stupid fool of a word, so it does!” said Tom hastily. “I had forgot--adsum, ades, affui, adesse.”",sure stupid fool word say forget ade affui adesse 
27,"Richard said no more, but proposed the word oppositus.",say more propose word oppositus 
28,“Adjective.”,adjective 
29,"Ethel was surprised, for she remembered that it was, in this passage, part of a passive verb, which Tom had construed correctly, “it was objected,” and she had thought this very creditable to him, whereas he now evidently took it for opposite; however, on Richard’s reading the line, he corrected himself and called it a participle, but did not commit himself further, till asked for its derivation.",surprise remember passage part passive verb construe object think creditable take opposite read line correct call participle commit ask derivation 
30,“From oppositor.”,oppositor 
31,"“Hallo!” cried Harry, who hitherto had been abstracted in his book, but now turned, raised himself on his elbow, and, at the blunder, shook his thick yellow locks, and showed his teeth like a young lion.",cry abstract book turn raise elbow blunder shake thick yellow lock show tooth young lion 
32,"“No, now, Tom, pay attention,” said Richard resignedly. “If you found out its meaning, you must have seen its derivation.”",pay attention say find meaning see derivation 
33,"“Oppositus,” said Tom, twisting his fingers, and gazing first at Ethel, then at Harry, in hopes of being prompted, then at the ceiling and floor, the while he drawled out the word with a whine, “why, oppositus from op-posor.”",oppositus say twist finger gaze hope prompt ceiling floor while drawl word whine oppositus op posor 
34,“A poser! ain’t it?” said Harry.,poser say 
35,"“Don’t, Harry, you distract him,” said Richard. “Come, Tom, say at once whether you know it or not--it is of no use to invent.”",distract say come say know use invent 
36,“From op-” and a mumble.,op mumble 
37,“What? I don’t hear--op--”,hear op 
38,"Tom again looked for help to Harry, who made a mischievous movement of his lips, as if prompting, and, deceived by it, he said boldly, “From op-possum.”",look help make mischievous movement lip prompt deceive say op possum 
39,"“That’s right! let us hear him decline it!” cried Harry, in an ecstasy. “Oppossum, opottis, opposse, or oh-pottery!”",right let hear decline cry ecstasy oppossum opottis opposse pottery 
40,"“Harry,” said Richard, in a gentle reasonable voice, “I wish you would be so kind as not to stay, if you cannot help distracting him.”",say gentle reasonable voice wish kind stay help distract 
41,"And Harry, who really had a tolerable share of forbearance and consideration, actually obeyed, contenting himself with tossing his book into the air and catching it again, while he paused at the door to give his last unsolicited assistance. “Decline oppossum you say. I’ll tell you how: O-possum re-poses up a gum tree. O-pot-you-I will, says the O-posse of Yankees, come out to ketch him. Opossum poses them and declines in O-pot-esse by any manner of means of o-potting-di-do-dum, was quite oppositum-oppotitu, in fact, quite contrairy.”",have tolerable share forbearance consideration obey content toss book air catching pause door give last unsolicited assistance decline oppossum say tell o possum re-pose gum tree o pot say o posse come ketch opossum pose decline o pot esse manner means potting do dum oppositum oppotitu fact contrairy 
42,"Richard, with the gravity of a victim, heard this sally of schoolboy wit, which threw Ethel back on the sofa in fits of laughing, and declaring that the Opossum declined, not that he was declined; but, in the midst of the disturbance thus created, Tom stepped up to her, and whispered, “Do tell me, Ethel!”",gravity victim hear sally schoolboy wit throw sofa fit laugh declare decline decline midst disturbance create step whisper tell 
43,"“Indeed I shan’t,” said she. “Why don’t you say fairly if you don’t know?”",say say know 
44,"He was obliged to confess his ignorance, and Richard made him conjugate the whole verb opponor from beginning to end, in which he wanted a good deal of help.",oblige confess ignorance make conjugate whole verb opponor begin end want good deal help 
45,"Ethel could not help saying, “How did you find out the meaning of that word, Tom, if you didn’t look out the verb?”",help say find meaning word look verb 
46,"“I--don’t know,” drawled Tom, in the voice, half sullen, half piteous, which he always assumed when out of sorts.",know drawl voice half sullen half piteous assume sort 
47,"“It is very odd,” she said decidedly; but Richard took no notice, and proceeded to the other lessons, which went off tolerably well, except the arithmetic, where there was some great misunderstanding, into which Ethel did not enter for some time. When she did attend, she perceived that Tom had brought a right answer, without understanding the working of the sum, and that Richard was putting him through it. She began to be worked into a state of dismay and indignation at Tom’s behaviour, and Richard’s calm indifference, which made her almost forget ‘Jane Sparks’, and long to be alone with Richard; but all the world kept coming into the room, and going out, and she could not say what was in her mind till after dinner, when, seeing Richard go up into Margaret’s room, she ran after him, and entering it, surprised Margaret, by not beginning on her books, but saying at once, “Ritchie, I wanted to speak to you about Tom. I am sure he shuffled about those lessons.”",odd say take notice proceed other lesson go arithmetic be great misunderstanding enter time attend perceive bring right answer understand working sum put begin work state dismay indignation behaviour calm indifference make forget alone world keep come room go say mind dinner see go room run enter surprise begin book say want speak sure shuffle lesson

49,"“What, do you mean that it is often so?”",mean 
50,"“Much too often,” said Richard; “but I have never been able to detect him; he is very sharp, and has some underhand way of preparing his lessons that I cannot make out.”",say able detect sharp have underhand way prepare lesson make 
51,"“Did you know it, Margaret?” said Ethel, astonished not to see her sister looked shocked as well as sorry.",know say astonished see sister look shocked sorry 
52,"“Yes,” said Margaret, “Ritchie and I have often talked it over, and tried to think what was to be done.”",say talk try think do 
53,“Dear me! why don’t you tell papa? It is such a terrible thing!”,tell papa terrible thing 
54,"“So it is,” said Margaret, “but we have nothing positive or tangible to accuse Tom of; we don’t know what he does, and have never caught him out.”",say have positive tangible accuse know do catch 
55,"“I am sure he must have found out the meaning of that oppositum in some wrong way--if he had looked it out, he would only have found opposite. Nothing but opponor could have shown him the rendering which he made.”",sure find meaning oppositum wrong way look find opposite opponor show rendering make

58,"“It would be impossible to do so always,” said both the Latin scholars at once.",impossible do say latin scholar 
59,"“Well, I can’t think how you can take it so quietly,” said Ethel. “I would have told papa the first moment, and put a stop to it. I have a great mind to do so, if you won’t.",think take say tell first moment put stop have great mind do 
60,"“Ethel, Ethel, that would never do!” exclaimed Margaret, “pray don’t. Papa would be so dreadfully grieved and angry with poor Tom.”",do exclaim pray grieve angry poor 
61,"“Well, so he deserves,” said Ethel.",deserve say 
62,"“You don’t know what it is to see papa angry,” said Richard.",know see papa angry say 
63,"“Dear me, Richard!” cried Ethel, who thought she knew pretty well what his sharp words were. “I’m sure papa never was angry with me, without making me love him more, and, at least, want to be better.”",cry think know sharp word sure papa angry make love more least want good 
64,"“You are a girl,” said Richard.",girl say 
65,"“You are higher spirited, and shake off things faster,” said Margaret.",spirit shake thing fast say 
66,"“Why, what do you think he would do to Tom?”",think do 
67,"“I think he would be so very angry, that Tom, who, you know, is timid and meek, would be dreadfully frightened,” said Richard.",think angry know timid meek frighten say 
68,"“That’s just what he ought to be, frightened out of these tricks.”",frighten trick 
69,"“I am afraid it would frighten him into them still more,” said Richard, “and perhaps give him such a dread of my father as would prevent him from ever being open with him.”",afraid frighten more say give dread father prevent open 
70,"“Besides, it would make papa so very unhappy,” added Margaret. “Of course, if poor dear Tom had been found out in any positive deceit, we ought to mention it at once, and let him be punished; but while it is all vague suspicion, and of what papa has such a horror of, it would only grieve him, and make him constantly anxious, without, perhaps, doing Tom any good.”",make papa unhappy add course poor dear find positive deceit mention let punish vague suspicion papa have horror grieve make anxious do good 
71,"“I think all that is expediency,” said Ethel, in her bluff, abrupt way.",think expediency say bluff abrupt way 
72,"“Besides,” said Richard, “we have nothing positive to accuse him of, and if we had, it would be of no use. He will be at school in three weeks, and there he would be sure to shirk, even if he left it off here. Every one does, and thinks nothing of it.”",say have positive accuse have use school week sure shirk leave one think 
73,"“Richard!” cried both sisters, shocked. “You never did?”",cry sister shocked

76,"“I know it is very wrong, but you’ll never get the general run of boys to think so,” said Richard.",know wrong get general run boy think say 
77,"“Then Tom ought not to go to school at all till he is well armed against it,” said Ethel.",go school armed say 
78,"“That can’t be helped,” said Richard. “He will get clear of it in time, when he knows better.”",help say get clear time know good 
79,"“I will talk to him,” said Margaret, “and, indeed, I think it would be better than worrying papa.”",talk say think good worry papa 
80,"“Well,” said Ethel, “of course I shan’t tell, because it is not my business, but I think papa ought to know everything about us, and I don’t like your keeping anything back. It is being almost as bad as Tom himself.”",say course tell business think papa ought know like keep bad 
81,"With which words, as Flora entered, Ethel marched out of the room in displeasure, and went down, resolved to settle Jane Sparks by herself.",word enter march room displeasure go resolve settle 
82,"“Ethel is out of sorts to-day,” said Flora. “What’s the matter?”",sort day say matter

Her principle is quite right, but I doubt--”",have discussion say shocked find think poor little think tell papa principle right doubt 
84,"“I know exactly how Ethel would do it!” cried Flora; “blurt out all on a sudden, ‘Papa, Tom cheats at his lessons!’ then there would be a tremendous uproar, papa would scold Tom till he almost frightened him out of his wits, and then find out it was only suspicion.”",know do cry blurt sudden cheat lesson be tremendous uproar papa scold frighten wit find suspicion 
85,"“And never have any comfort again,” said Margaret. “He would always dread that Tom was deceiving him, and then think it was all for want of--Oh, no, it will never do to speak of it, unless we find out some positive piece of misbehaviour.”",have comfort say dread deceive think want do speak find positive piece misbehaviour 
86,"“Certainly,” said Flora.",say 
87,"“And it would do Tom no good to make him afraid of papa,” said Richard.",do good make afraid papa say 
88,"“Ethel’s rule is right in principle,” said Margaret thoughtfully, “that papa ought to know all without reserve, and yet it will hardly do in practice. One must use discretion, and not tease him about every little thing. He takes them so much to heart, that he would be almost distracted; and, with so much business abroad, I think at home he should have nothing but rest, and, as far as we can, freedom from care and worry. Anything wrong about the children brings on the grief so much, that I cannot bear to mention it.”",rule right principle say papa know reserve do practice use discretion tease little thing take much heart distract much business think home have rest freedom care worry wrong child bring grief bear mention 
89,"Richard and Flora agreed with her, admiring the spirit which made her, in her weakness and helplessness, bear the whole burden of family cares alone, and devote herself entirely to spare her father. He was, indeed, her first object, and she would have sacrificed anything to give him ease of mind; but, perhaps, she regarded him more as a charge of her own, than as, in very truth, the head of the family. She had the government in her hands, and had never been used to see him exercise it much in detail (she did not know how much her mother had referred to him in private), and had succeeded to her authority at a time when his health and spirits were in such a state as to make it doubly needful to spare him. It was no wonder that she sometimes carried her consideration beyond what was strictly right, and forgot that he was the real authority, more especially as his impulsive nature sometimes carried him away, and his sound judgment was not certain to come into play at the first moment, so that it required some moral courage to excite displeasure, so easy of manifestation; and of such courage there was, perhaps, a deficiency in her character. Nor had she yet detected her own satisfaction in being the first with every one in the family.",agree admire spirit make weakness helplessness bear whole burden family care devote spare father first object sacrifice give ease mind regard more charge own truth head family have government hand use see exercise detail know much mother refer private succeed authority time health spirit state make needful spare wonder carry consideration right forget real authority impulsive nature carry sound judgment certain come play first moment require moral courage excite displeasure easy manifestation such courage be deficiency character detect own satisfaction first one family 
90,"Ethel was put out, as Flora had discovered, and when she was downstairs she found it out, and accused herself of having been cross to Margaret, and unkind to Tom--of wishing to be a tell-tale. But still, though displeased with herself, she was dissatisfied with Margaret; it might be right, but it did not agree with her notions. She wanted to see every one uncompromising, as girls of fifteen generally do; she had an intense disgust and loathing of underhand ways, could not bear to think of Tom’s carrying them on, and going to a place of temptation with them uncorrected; and she looked up to her father with the reverence and enthusiasm of one like minded.",put discover find accuse cross unkind wish tell tale displease dissatisfied right agree notion want see one uncompromising girl have intense disgust loathing underhand way bear think carry go place temptation uncorrected look father reverence enthusiasm minded 
91,"She was vexed on another score. Norman came home from Abbotstoke Grange without having seen Miss Rivers, but with a fresh basket of choice flowers, rapturous descriptions of Mr. Rivers’s prints, and a present of an engraving, in shading, such as to give the effect of a cast, of a very fine head of Alexander. Nothing was to be thought of but a frame for this--olive, bay, laurel, everything appropriate to the conqueror. Margaret and Norman were engrossed in the subject, and, to Ethel, who had no toleration for fancy work, who expected everything to be either useful or intellectual, this seemed very frivolous. She heard her father say how glad he was to see Norman interested and occupied, and certainly, though it was only in leather leaves, it was better than drooping and attending to nothing. She knew, too, that Margaret did it for his sake, but, said Ethel to herself, “It was very odd that people should find amusement in such things. Margaret always had a turn for them, but it was very strange in Norman.”",vex score come see fresh basket choice flower rapturous description print present engraving shading such give effect cast fine head think frame olive bay laurel appropriate conqueror engross subject have toleration fancy work expect useful intellectual seem frivolous hear father say glad see interested occupy leather leave good droop attend know do sake say odd person find amusement such thing have turn strange 
92,"Then came the pang of finding out that this was aggravated by the neglect of herself; she called it all selfishness, and felt that she had had an uncomfortable, unsatisfactory day, with everything going wrong.",come pang find aggravate neglect call selfishness feel have uncomfortable unsatisfactory day go wrong
