2," The Russian gentleman was better the next day, and the day after that better still, and on the third day he was well enough to come into the garden. A basket chair was put for him and he sat there, dressed in clothes of Father’s which were too big for him. But when Mother had hemmed up the ends of the sleeves and the trousers, the clothes did well enough. His was a kind face now that it was no longer tired and frightened, and he smiled at the children whenever he saw them. They wished very much that he could speak English. Mother wrote several letters to people she thought might know whereabouts in England a Russian gentleman’s wife and family might possibly be; not to the people she used to know before she came to live at Three Chimneys--she never wrote to any of them--but strange people--Members of Parliament and Editors of papers, and Secretaries of Societies.",russian gentleman good next day day good third day come garden basket chair put sit dress clothes father big mother hemm end sleeve trousers clothes kind face tired frighten smile child see wish speak mother write several letter person think know whereabouts russian gentleman wife family person use know come live write strange person editor paper secretary

4,"The children wanted very much to show how kindly they felt to this man who had been sent to prison and to Siberia just for writing a beautiful book about poor people. They could smile at him, of course; they could and they did. But if you smile too constantly, the smile is apt to get fixed like the smile of the hyaena. And then it no longer looks friendly, but simply silly. So they tried other ways, and brought him flowers till the place where he sat was surrounded by little fading bunches of clover and roses and Canterbury bells.",child want much show feel man send prison write beautiful book poor person smile course smile smile apt fix smile hyaena look friendly silly try other way bring flower place sit surround little fade bunch clover rose bell

57,"The Russian gentleman was so delighted with the strawberries that the three racked their brains to find some other surprise for him. But all the racking did not bring out any idea more novel than wild cherries. And this idea occurred to them next morning. They had seen the blossom on the trees in the spring, and they knew where to look for wild cherries now that cherry time was here. The trees grew all up and along the rocky face of the cliff out of which the mouth of the tunnel opened. There were all sorts of trees there, birches and beeches and baby oaks and hazels, and among them the cherry blossom had shone like snow and silver.",russian gentleman delighted strawberry rack brain find other surprise rack bring idea more novel wild cherry idea occur next morning see blossom tree spring know look wild cherry cherry time tree grow rocky face cliff mouth tunnel open be sort tree birch beeche baby oak hazel cherry blossom shine snow silver 
58,"The mouth of the tunnel was some way from Three Chimneys, so Mother let them take their lunch with them in a basket. And the basket would do to bring the cherries back in if they found any. She also lent them her silver watch so that they should not be late for tea. Peter’s Waterbury had taken it into its head not to go since the day when Peter dropped it into the water-butt. And they started. When they got to the top of the cutting, they leaned over the fence and looked down to where the railway lines lay at the bottom of what, as Phyllis said, was exactly like a mountain gorge.",mouth tunnel way let take lunch basket basket do bring cherry find loan silver watch late tea take head go day drop water butt start get top cutting learn fence look railway line lay bottom say mountain gorge 
59,"“If it wasn’t for the railway at the bottom, it would be as though the foot of man had never been there, wouldn’t it?”",railway bottom foot man 
60,"The sides of the cutting were of grey stone, very roughly hewn. Indeed, the top part of the cutting had been a little natural glen that had been cut deeper to bring it down to the level of the tunnel’s mouth. Among the rocks, grass and flowers grew, and seeds dropped by birds in the crannies of the stone had taken root and grown into bushes and trees that overhung the cutting. Near the tunnel was a flight of steps leading down to the line--just wooden bars roughly fixed into the earth--a very steep and narrow way, more like a ladder than a stair.",side cutting grey stone hewn top part cutting little natural glen cut deep bring level tunnel mouth rock grass flower grow seed drop bird cranny stone take root grow bush tree overh cutting tunnel flight step lead line wooden bar fix earth steep narrow way ladder stair

62,So they went along the fence towards the little swing gate that is at the top of these steps. And they were almost at the gate when Bobbie said:--,go fence little swing gate top step gate say 
63,“Hush. Stop! What’s that?”,stop 
64,"“That” was a very odd noise indeed--a soft noise, but quite plainly to be heard through the sound of the wind in tree branches, and the hum and whir of the telegraph wires. It was a sort of rustling, whispering sound. As they listened it stopped, and then it began again.",odd noise soft noise hear sound wind tree branch hum whir telegraph wire sort rustle whisper sound listen stop begin

66,"“Look”--cried Peter, suddenly--“the tree over there!”",look cry tree 
67,"The tree he pointed at was one of those that have rough grey leaves and white flowers. The berries, when they come, are bright scarlet, but if you pick them, they disappoint you by turning black before you get them home. And, as Peter pointed, the tree was moving--not just the way trees ought to move when the wind blows through them, but all in one piece, as though it were a live creature and were walking down the side of the cutting.",tree point have rough grey leave white flower berries come bright scarlet pick disappoint turn black get point tree move way tree move wind blow piece live creature walk side cutting

70,"It really did seem a little like magic. For all the trees for about twenty yards of the opposite bank seemed to be slowly walking down towards the railway line, the tree with the grey leaves bringing up the rear like some old shepherd driving a flock of green sheep.",seem little magic tree yard opposite bank seem walk railway line tree grey leave bring rear old shepherd drive flock green sheep

72,But Bobbie and Peter clung fast to the rail and watched breathlessly. And Phyllis made no movement towards going home by herself.,cling rail watch make movement go 
73,The trees moved on and on. Some stones and loose earth fell down and rattled on the railway metals far below.,tree move stone loose earth fall rattle railway metal 
74,"“It’s ALL coming down,” Peter tried to say, but he found there was hardly any voice to say it with. And, indeed, just as he spoke, the great rock, on the top of which the walking trees were, leaned slowly forward. The trees, ceasing to walk, stood still and shivered. Leaning with the rock, they seemed to hesitate a moment, and then rock and trees and grass and bushes, with a rushing sound, slipped right away from the face of the cutting and fell on the line with a blundering crash that could have been heard half a mile off. A cloud of dust rose up.",come try say find be voice say speak great rock top walking tree learn tree cease walk stand shiver lean rock seem hesitate moment rock tree grass bush rush sound slip face cutting fall line blunder crash hear mile cloud dust rise

95,"They did, and with the petticoats rolled up under their arms, ran along the railway, skirting the newly fallen mound of stones and rock and earth, and bent, crushed, twisted trees. They ran at their best pace. Peter led, but the girls were not far behind. They reached the corner that hid the mound from the straight line of railway that ran half a mile without curve or corner.",petticoat roll arm run railway skirt fall mound stone rock earth bent crush twist tree run good pace lead girl reach corner hide mound straight line railway run mile curve corner

103,"“We must cut holes in the flags, and run the sticks through the holes,”  said Peter. And the holes were cut. The knife was sharp enough to cut flannel with. Two of the flags were set up in heaps of loose stones between the sleepers of the down line. Then Phyllis and Roberta took each a flag, and stood ready to wave it as soon as the train came in sight.",cut hole flag run stick hole say hole cut knife sharp cut flannel flag set heap loose stone sleeper down line take flag stand ready wave train come sight

It would go rushing by them and tear round the corner and go crashing into that awful mound. And everyone would be killed. Her hands grew very cold and trembled so that she could hardly hold the flag.

120,"“Oh, stop, stop, stop!” cried Bobbie. No one heard her. At least Peter and Phyllis didn’t, for the oncoming rush of the train covered the sound of her voice with a mountain of sound. But afterwards she used to wonder whether the engine itself had not heard her. It seemed almost as though it had--for it slackened swiftly, slackened and stopped, not twenty yards from the place where Bobbie’s two flags waved over the line. She saw the great black engine stop dead, but somehow she could not stop waving the flags. And when the driver and the fireman had got off the engine and Peter and Phyllis had gone to meet them and pour out their excited tale of the awful mound just round the corner, Bobbie still waved the flags but more and more feebly and jerkily.",stop stop stop cry hear least oncoming rush train cover sound voice mountain sound use wonder engine hear seem slacken slacken stop yard place flag wave line see great black engine stop dead stop wave flag driver fireman get engine go meet pour excite tale awful mound corner wave flag

This cheered the others wonderfully. They had seen her cry before, but they had never seen her faint, nor anyone else, for the matter of that. They had not known what to do when she was fainting, but now she was only crying they could thump her on the back and tell her not to, just as they always did.
