1,CHAPTER 6. ROGER HIS OWN MASTER.,own master 
2,"There lay Roger under the tree, thinking that there was nothing to prevent his having all his own way now, and that he was going to be very happy.  He had always thought it hard that he could not have his own way entirely, and had been unsatisfied with a much greater degree of liberty than most people wish or have.",lay tree think be prevent have own way go happy think have own way unsatisfied great degree liberty most person wish have 
3,"He had hitherto led a wandering life, having no home duties, no school to go to, no trade to work at,--no garden, or other pleasure, to fix him to one spot.  He had gone, with his uncle, from sporting on the moors, in one season of the year, to sporting in the marshes in another; and, wild as was this way of life, it made his will so much wilder, that he was always wishing for more liberty still.  When his aunt had desired him to watch the kettle, as it hung over the fire near the tent, or asked him to help her in shaking out their bedding, or cleaning their utensils, he had turned sulky, and wished that he lived alone, where he need not be plagued about other people's affairs.  When his uncle had ordered him to attend at a certain spot and hour, with nets or a gun, he had been wont to feel himself seized with a sudden desire to wander in an opposite direction, or to lie half asleep in the sun, too lazy to work at all.  When he had played truant, and returned late to the tent, and found nothing better left to eat than a dry crust of bread, or the cold remains of a mess of fish, he had frequently thought how pleasant it would be to have the best of everything for himself, and only his dog to eat up the rest.  So this boy had often felt and thought; and so would many think and feel, perhaps, if there were many as forlorn and friendless as he, with no one to love and be loved by.  Though he had had an uncle and aunt, he had never had a friend.  He knew that they cared about him only because he could help to keep the tent, and take the game; and, feeling this, it was irksome to him to be under their orders.",lead wonder life have home duty school go trade work garden other pleasure fix spot go uncle sport moor season year sport marsh wild way life make will wild wish more liberty aunt desire watch kettle hang fire tent ask help shake bedding clean utensil turn sulky wish live plague other person affair uncle order attend certain spot hour net gun wont feel seize sudden desire wander opposite direction lie asleep sun lazy work play truant return tent find leave eat dry crust bread cold remains mess fish think pleasant have good dog eat rest boy feel think many think feel be many forlorn friendless love love have uncle aunt have friend know care help keep tent take game feel irksome order 
4,"The time was now come for which he had so often longed.  He was his own master completely.  There was nobody near who could order or compel him to do anything; while he, on his part, had an obedient servant in his dog.  The sky was blue and warm overhead, and the trees cast a pleasant shade.  The Red-hill was now an island, which he had all to himself; and it was richly stocked with game, for his food and sport.  Here he could have his own way, and be completely happy.",time come long own master be order compel do part have obedient servant dog sky blue warm tree cast pleasant shade red hill island have stock game food sport have own way happy 
5,"Such was Roger's idea when he stole the tinder-box, and crossed to the hill; and this was what he said to himself as he cooked his meal, and when he lay down after it on the grass, with the bees humming round him, and the sound of the waters being now a pleasant ripple, instead of the rush and roar of yesterday.  He desired his dog to lie down, and not disturb him; and he took this opportunity to change the animal's name. Stephen Redfurn, taking up the quarrel of the day against the bishops, would have the dog called ""Bishop,"" and nothing else.  Roger had always wished to call him ""Spy;"" but Bishop would never answer to the name of Spy, or even seem to hear it.  Now, however, Bishop was to be Spy, as there was no one here to indulge the dog with his old name; and Spy was told so many times over, and with all the devices that could be thought of for impressing the fact on his memory.",such idea steal tinder box cross hill say cook meal lay grass bee hum sound water pleasant ripple rush roar yesterday desire dog lie disturb take opportunity change animal name take quarrel day bishop have dog call else wish call answer name seem hear be indulge dog old name tell many time device think impress fact memory 
6,"This lesson being given, Roger shut his eyes, and thought he would sleep as long as he chose; but, in the first place, he found himself too much heated for sleep.  He considered that it was no wonder, after broiling himself in making a fire to broil his hare.  He wished animals ran about ready cooked--as fruits grow on the sunny side of trees.  It was too bad to have to bustle and toil for an hour, to get ready what was eaten in ten minutes; and it just passed through his mind that, whatever Nan Redfurn might have sometimes said and done to him, she had usually saved him all trouble in cooking, and had had his meals ready for him whenever he chose to be at the tent at meal times.  He rose, and thought he could find a cooler place, further under the trees.",lesson give shut eye think sleep choose first place find heat sleep consider wonder broil make fire broil hare wish animal run ready cook fruit grow sunny side tree bad have bustle toil hour get ready eat minute pass mind say do save trouble cooking have meal ready choose tent meal time rise think find cool place tree 
7,"He did so, and again lay down.  Sleep began to steal over him; and, at the same time, the thought crept into his mind that he should never more see Stephen Redfurn.  The ideas that come when one is dropping asleep are very vivid; and this one startled Roger so, that Spy found it out, and pricked up his ears, as if at some alarm.  This thought would not go away; for it so happened that the last words that Stephen and Roger had spoken together were angry ones.  Stephen had ordered Roger to carry the fry they had fished for manure to a field, where he had promised to deposit it by a certain time.  Roger had been sure that the fish would be better for lying in the sun a while longer, and refused to touch it. No matter which was right about the manure; both were wrong in being angry.  Stephen had said that Roger was a young rascal, who would never come to good; and Roger had looked impertinently in his uncle's face, while whistling to the dog to come with him, and make sport among the water-fowl.  It was that face--that countenance of his uncle's, as he had last seen it, which was before Roger's eyes now, as he lay dozing. With it came the angry tones of Stephen's voice, saying that he would never come to good.  Mixed and confused with this was the roar of a coming flood, and a question (how and whence spoken he knew not) whether his uncle might not possibly have been saved, if he had not, against orders, carried away Bishop--for the dog was still Bishop in his master's dreams.",lay sleep begin steal same time thought creep mind see idea come drop asleep vivid one startle find prick ear alarm thought go happen last word speak angry one order carry fry fish manure field promise deposit certain time sure fish good lie sun while refuse touch matter right manure wrong angry say young rascal come good look uncle face whistle dog come make sport water fowl face countenance uncle see eye lay doze come angry tone voice say come good mix confuse roar come flood question speak know uncle save order carry dog master dream 
8,"Roger started bolt upright, and looked about him.  He felt very tired; but he thought he would not lie down again just yet.  It was odd that he could not get sound asleep, so tired as he was.  If he should not sleep better than this at night, what should he do?  He wished he had some more of that woman's cherry-brandy.  He had slept sound enough after drinking that.  It was well for Roger that he was not now within reach of intoxicating liquors--the state of his mind would probably have made a drunkard of him.",start bolt look feel tired think lie odd get sound asleep tired sleep good night do wish have more woman cherry brandy sleep sound drink reach intoxicating liquor state mind make drunkard 
9,"His mind ran strangely on his uncle, and his uncle's last looks and words, even as he stood wide awake, and staring at the bee-hives.  A rustle in the briars behind him made him jump as if he had been shot. It was only a partridge taking wing.",mind run uncle uncle last look word stand stare bee hive rustle briar make jump shoot partridge take wing 
10,"""Whirr away!"" said Roger to her.  ""You can't go far.  You will have to light again upon my island.  You all belong to me--you swarming creatures!  You may run about awhile, and flutter away a bit; but you will all belong to me at last, with Spy to help me.  I'll have some sport, now.  Here, Spy!  Spy!""",whirr say go have light island belong swarm creature run flutter bit belong last help have sport 
11,"Spy had disappeared, and did not come when called.  A whistle brought him, however, at last.  He came out of the thicket, licking his chops. Being commanded to bring his game, he soon produced two rabbits.  It was easy work for the dog to catch them; for the poor creatures had no holes here.  They had come to this raised ground from a warren some way off, where they had been soaked out of their holes.",disappear come call whistle bring last come thicket lick chop command bring game produce rabbit easy work dog catch poor creature have hole come raise ground way soak hole 
12,"Spy was praised for everything but not answering to his name.  For that he was lectured, and then sent off again, to try what he could find.  He brought in prey of various kinds; for he could not stir among the trees without starting some.  During the fun, as Roger thought it, while the terrified birds were fluttering among the branches of the trees, and the scared animals bursting through the thicket, Roger resolved that he would not plague himself with any more thoughts of Stephen and Nan.  If they were drowned, it was none of his doing; and, as for Stephen's anger yesterday, there was nothing new in that; Stephen was angry every day of his life.  He would not be scared out of his sleep any more by nonsense. He would not give up having his own way to see Stephen and Nan under these very trees; and, as he had got his own way at last, he would enjoy it.",praise answer name lecture send try find bring prey various kind stir tree start fun think terrified bird flutter branch tree scared animal burst thicket resolve plague more thought drown do anger yesterday be new angry day life scared sleep nonsense give have own way see very tree get own way last enjoy 
13,"This mood went on till there was such a heap of dead animals, that Roger began to think whether he could skin them all, and clean their skins, in such hot weather as this, before they were unfit for any use.  As for eating them, here was twenty times as much food as could be eaten while it was good.  He did just remember the children and Ailwin, and how much they probably wanted food; but he settled that it was no business of his; and he was not going to trouble himself to leave his island for anybody.  He would call in Spy, and tie him up; for there must be no more game killed to-day.",mood go be heap dead animal begin think skin clean skin such hot weather unfit use eat time much food eat good remember child much want food settle business go trouble leave island call tie be more game kill day 
14,"Spy did not come for any calling,--for anything short of the well-known whistle, as Roger would not utter the name of Bishop.  Roger grew very angry at being obeyed no better than this; and his last whistle was so shrill that the dog seemed to know what it threatened, refused to answer it as long as he dared, and then came unwillingly, with fear in every attitude.  He gave a low whine when he saw his master; as he had good reason to do.  Roger tied him to a tree, and then gave loose to his passion.  He thrashed the dog with a switch till the poor creature's whine was heard and pitied by the children and Ailwin on their house-top; and there is no knowing how long the whipping might not have gone on, if the animal had not at last turned furious, and snapped at Roger in a way which made him think of giving over, and finding something else to do with his sovereignty.",come calling short know whistle utter name grow angry obey good last whistle shrill dog seem know threaten refuse answer dare come fear attitude give low whine see master have good reason do tie tree give loose passion thrash dog switch poor creature whine hear pity child house top be know whipping go animal turn furious snap way make think give find else do sovereignty 
15,"He found it was rather dull work, so far, having all his own way, in an island of his own.  At last, he bethought himself of an amusement he had been fond of before he lived so much in the moors and the carrs.  He bethought himself of bird's-nesting.  It was too late for eggs; but he thought the bird-families might not have all dispersed.  Here were plenty of trees, and they must be full of birds; for, though they were silent to-day (he did wish the place was not quite so silent!) they sometimes sent their warblings so far over the carr, that Nan Redfurn would mention them in the tent.  He would see what ailed them, that they would not give him any music to-day.  By incessant cooing, he obtained an answer from one solitary pigeon; which he took advantage of to climb the tree, and look for the nest.  He found a nest; but there was nothing in it.  He climbed several trees, and found abundance of nests; but all deserted.  Except his solitary pigeon (which presently vanished), there appeared to be not a winged creature in all those trees.  The birds had been frightened away by the roar of the flood of yesterday; and, perhaps, by seeing the fields, to which they had been wont to resort for their food, all turned into a waste of muddy waters.",find dull work have own way island own last bethough amusement fond live moor carr bethough bird nest late egg think bird family disperse plenty tree full bird silent day wish place silent send warbling carr mention tent see ail give music day incessant cooing obtain answer solitary pigeon take advantage climb tree look nest find nest be climb several tree find abundance nest desert solitary pigeon vanish appear be winged creature tree bird frighten roar flood yesterday see field wont resort food turn waste muddy water 
16,"Roger threw to the ground every empty nest he found, from the common inability of a boy to keep his hands off a bird's-nest.  When he was tired of climbing trees, he picked up all the scattered nests, and laid them in a long row on the grass.  They looked dismal enough.  It is disagreeable to see a range of houses left half-built (such as may be seen in the neighbourhood of large towns), with the doorways gaping, and the window-spaces empty, and roofs hardly covering in the dark inside; but such a row of houses is less dismal than Roger's array of birds'-nests.  There is something in the very make of a bird's-nest which rouses thoughts of blue or red-spotted eggs, of callow young birds, with their large hungry eyes and beaks, or of twittering fledglings, training for a summer life of pleasure.  To see, instead of these, their silent empty habitations, extended in a long row, would be enough to make any one dull and sad.  So Roger found.  He kicked them into a heap under a tree, and thought that they would make a fine crackling fire.  He would burn them, every one.",throw ground empty nest find common inability boy keep hand bird nest tired climb tree pick scatter nest lay long row grass look dismal disagreeable see range house leave half build such see neighbourhood large town doorway gape window space empty roof cover dark row house dismal array birds'- nest be very make bird nest rouse thought blue red spot egg callow young bird large hungry eye beak twiteer fledgling training summer life pleasure see silent empty habitation extend long row enough make one dull sad find kick heap tree think make fine crackling fire burn one 
17,"While he was wondering whether any birds would come back to miss their nests, it struck him that he had not thought how he was to pass the night.  It was nothing new to him to sleep in the open air.  He liked it best at this season.  But he had usually had a rug to lie upon, with the tent over him; or a blanket; or, at worst, he had a sack to creep into. The clothes he had on were old and thin; and as he looked at them, it made him angry to think that he was not to have everything as he liked it, after all.  Here he should have to pass a cold night, and with nothing between him and the hard ground.  He thought of gathering leaves, moss, and high grass, to roll himself up in, like a squirrel in its hole; but the trouble was what he did not like.  He stood listlessly thinking how much trouble it would cost to collect moss and leaves for the purpose; and, while he was so thinking, he went on pelting his dog with birds'-nests, and seeing how the angry dog, unable to get loose, snapped up and shook to pieces the nests which fell within his reach.",wonder bird come miss nest strike think pass night new sleep open air like good season have rug lie tent blanket bad have sack creep clothes have old thin look make angry think have like have pass cold night hard ground think gather leave moss high grass roll squirrel hole trouble like stand think much trouble cost collect moss leave purpose think go pelt dog birds'- nest see angry dog unable get loose snap shake piece nest fall reach 
18,"Roger knew that he ought to be skinning some of the dead animals, if he really meant to secure all their skins, before it was too late; but this also was troublesome.  Instead of doing this, he went round the hill, to see what the Linacres were about, resolving by no means to appear to see them, if they should be making signs from the window to have the things back again that he had carried away.  On coming out of the shade on that side of the hill, he was surprised to see smoke still going up from his fire, considering that the fire was nearly out when he had left it. Something more strange met his eye as he ran forward.  There was the nice clean blanket spread out on the ground, with the tinder-box in the middle.",know skinn dead animal mean secure skin late troublesome do go hill see resolve means appear see make sign window have thing carry come shade side hill surprise see smoke go fire consider fire leave strange meet eye run be nice clean blanket spread ground tinder box middle 
19,"""Somebody has been here!"" cried Roger, much offended.  ""What business has anybody in my island?  Coming when my back is turned!  If I had only heard them coming to meddle--!""",cry offend business have island come back turn hear come meddle 
20,"Just then, his eye fell on the rug, blanket, and knife and fork left by Oliver,--the very accommodation he had been wishing for, and more.  When he felt the thick warm rug, he gave over his anger at some one having entered his island without his leave, and, for a moment, again felt pleased and happy.  But when he saw that the bridge-basket was gone-- that other people had the means of coming in upon him when they pleased--he was more angry than he had been all day.",eye fall rug blanket knife fork leave very accommodation wish more feel thick warm rug give anger one enter island leave moment feel pleased happy see bridge basket gone other person have means come pleased angry day 
21,"""However,"" thought he, ""I got over to the house before anyone else crossed the water, and I can do the same again whenever I please.  I have only to swim over with Spy, and bring away anything I like, while they are busy on the other side, about their good-for-nothing cow, or something.  That will be tit-for-tat.""",think get house else cross water do same have swim bring like busy other side good cow tit tat 
22,"He was doubly mistaken here.  His going over to steal comforts from the Linacres would not be tit-for-tat for Oliver's coming over to his father's hill, to bring away his mother's clothes basket, and leave comforts for an unwelcome visitor!  Neither could Roger now enter the Linacres' dwelling when he pleased, by swimming the stream.  He saw this when he examined and considered.  The water had sunk so as to show a few inches of the top of the entrance-door and lower windows.  It was not high enough to allow of his getting in at the upper window, as he did yesterday; and too high for entrance below.  The stream appeared to be as rapid and strong as ever; and it shot its force through the carr as vehemently as at first; for it was almost, or quite as deep as ever.  It had worn away soil at the bottom of its channel, to nearly or quite the same depth as it had sunk at the surface; so that it was still working against the walls and foundation of the house, and the soil of the hill, with as much force as during the first hour.  When Roger examined the red precipice from which he looked down upon the rushing stream, he perceived that not a yard of Linacres' garden could now be in existence. That garden, with its flourishing vegetables, its rare, gay, sweet flowers, and its laden fruit trees,--that garden which he and Stephen could not help admiring, while they told everybody that it had no business in the middle of their carr,--that garden, its earth and its plants, was all spread in ruins over the marsh; and instead of it would be found, if the waters could be dried up, a deep, gravelly, stony watercourse, or a channel of red mud.  Roger wondered whether the boy and girl were aware of this fate of their garden; or whether they supposed that everything stood fast and in order under the waters.  He wanted to point out the truth to them; and looked up to the chamber window, in hopes that they might be watching him from it.  No one was there, however.  On glancing higher, he saw them sitting within the balustrade on the roof.  They were all looking another way, and not appearing to think of him at all.  He watched them for a long while; but they never turned towards the Red-hill.  He could have made them hear by calling; but they might think he wished to be with them, or wanted something from them, instead of understanding that he desired to tell them that their pretty garden was destroyed.  So he began to settle with himself which of his dead game he would have for supper, and then fed his fire, in order to cook it.  He now thought that he should have liked a bird for supper,--a pheasant or partridge instead of a rabbit or leveret; of which he had plenty.  He felt it very provoking that he had neither a net nor a gun, for securing feathered game, when there was so much on the hill; so that he must put up with four-footed game, when he had rather have had a bird.  There was no bread either, or vegetables; but he minded that less, because neither of these were at hand, and he had often lived for a long time together on animal food.  During the whole time of his listless preparations for cooking his supper, he glanced up occasionally at the roof; but he never once saw the party look his way.  He thought it very odd that they should care so much less about him, than he knew they did when Stephen and he came into the carr. They neither seemed to want him nor to fear him to-day.",mistaken go steal comfort tit tat come father hill bring mother clothes basket leave comfort unwelcome visitor enter dwelling pleased swim stream see examine consider water sink show few inch top entrance door low window high allow get upper window yesterday high entrance stream appear rapid strong shoot force carr first deep wear soil bottom channel same depth sink surface work wall foundation house soil hill much force first hour examine red precipice look rush stream perceive yard garden existence garden flourish vegetable rare gay sweet flower laden fruit tree garden help admire tell have business middle carr garden earth plant spread ruin marsh find water dry deep gravelly stony watercourse channel red mud wonder boy girl aware fate garden suppose stand order water want point truth look chamber window hope watch glance high see sit balustrade roof look way appear think watch long while turn red hill make hear call think wish want understand desire tell pretty garden destroy begin settle dead game have supper feed fire order cook think like bird supper pheasant partridge rabbit leveret have plenty feel provoking have net gun secure feathered game be much hill put footed game have bird be bread vegetable minded less hand live long time animal food whole time listless preparation cook supper glance roof see party look way think odd care less know come carr seem want fear day 
23,"At length he went to set Spy loose, in order to feed him, and to have a companion, for he felt rather dull, while seeing how busily the party on the house-top were talking.  When he returned with Spy, the sun had set, and there was no one on the house-top.  A faint light from the chamber window told that Ailwin and the children were there.  Roger wondered how they had managed to kindle a fire, while he had the tinder-box.  He learned the truth, soon after, by upsetting the tinder-box, as he moved the blanket.  The steel fell out; and the flint and tinder were found to be absent.  In his present mood he considered it prodigious impertinence to impose upon him the labour of finding a flint the next day, and the choice whether to make tinder of a bit of his shirt, or to use shavings of wood instead.  He determined to show, meanwhile, that he had plenty of fire for to-night, and therefore heaped it up so high, that there was some danger that the lower branches of the ash under which he sat would shrivel up with the heat.",length go set order feed have companion feel dull see party house top talk return sun set be house top faint light chamber window tell child wonder manage kindle fire have tinder box learn truth upsetting tinder box move blanket steel fall flint tinder find absent present mood consider prodigious impertinence impose labour find flint next day choice make tinder bit shirt use shaving wood determine show have plenty fire night heap high be danger low branch ash sit shrivel heat 
24,"No blaze that he could make, however, could conceal from his own view the cheerful light from the chamber window.  There was certainly a good fire within; and those who sat beside it were probably better companions to each other than Spy was to him.  The dog was dull and would not play; and Roger himself soon felt too tired, or something, to wish to play. He could not conceal from himself that he should much like to be in that chamber from which the light shone, even though there was no cherry-brandy there now.",blaze make conceal own view cheerful light chamber window be good fire sit good companion other dog dull play feel tired wish play conceal like chamber light shine be cherry brandy 
25,"The stars were but just beginning to drop into the sky, and the waste of waters still looked yellow and bright to the west; but Roger's first day of having his own way had been quite long enough; and he spread his rug, and rolled himself in his blanket for the night.  Spy, being invited, drew near, and lay down too.  Roger was still overheated, from having made such an enormous fire; but he muffled up his head in his blanket, as if he was afraid lest even his dog should see that he was crying.",star begin drop sky waste water look yellow bright west first day have own way long spread rug roll blanket night invite draw lay overheat make enormous fire muffle head blanket afraid dog see cry
