2,"The fishpond was commenced the next morning.  Ready, Mr Seagrave, and William went down together to the beach, and, after much examination, chose a spot about one hundred yards from the turtle-pond as most eligible for the purpose; the water being shallow, so that at the part farthest from the shore there would not be more than three feet.",fishpond commence next morning ready go beach much examination choose spot yard turtle pond eligible purpose water shallow part farthest shore be more foot 
3,"""Now, sir,"" said Ready, ""this is a very simple job; all we have to do is to collect small rocks and stones, pile them up wall-fashion inside, and with a slope outside, so as to break the force of the waves when the water is a little rough; of course, the water will find its way through the stones, and will be constantly changed.  It's very true, that we can at most times catch fish when we want them, but it is not always that we can spare the time, so it's just as well to have always a certain quantity at hand, to take out at a moment's warning; and we can, of course, catch them and put them in here when we have nothing else to do. Juno will be able to come down and take them out with a spear, when we are away and she wants something for dinner.""",sir say ready simple job have do collect small rock stone pile wall fashion slope break force wave water little rough course water find way stone change true most time catch fish want spare time have certain quantity hand take moment warning course catch put have else do able come take spear want dinner 
4,"""But there are few stones about here, Ready; we shall have to fetch them a long way,"" said William.",be few stone ready have fetch long way say

6,"""But how shall we carry them, Ready?""",carry ready 
7,"""We will sling a tub on the axle; I will go up and get that ready and bring it down; in the meantime, you and Mr Seagrave can collect all the stones which are near at hand.""",sling tub axle go get ready bring meantime collect stone hand 
8,"Ready soon returned with the wheels, and the tub slung with rope on the axle, and by that means they found that they could collect the stones very fast; Mr Seagrave and William bringing them, and Ready in the water, building up the wall.",ready return wheel tub sling rope axle mean find collect stone bring ready water build wall 
9,"""We have quite forgot another job which we must put in hand, sir,"" observed Ready; ""but the fish-pond reminds me of it.""",forget job put hand sir observe ready fish pond remind 
10,"""What is that, Ready?""",ready 
11,"""A bathing-place for the children, and indeed for us all; we shall want it when the hot weather comes on, but we will put it off till then.  I can tell you, sir, that although I don't mind building this wall in the shallow water, I shall be very careful when the water is up to my knees, for you don't know how bold the sharks are in these latitudes.  When I was at St. Helena, not very long ago, we had a melancholy proof of it.""",bathing place child want hot weather come put tell sir mind build wall shallow water careful water knee know bold shark latitude have melancholy proof 
12,"""Tell us the story, Ready.""",tell story ready 
13,"""Well, two soldiers were standing on the rocks at St. Helena; the rocks were out of the water, but the swell just broke over them.  Two sharks swam up to them, and one of them, with a blow of his tail, turning round the same way, tripped one of them into the water, which was very deep. His comrade was very much frightened, and ran to the barracks to tell the story.  About a week afterwards, a schooner was in Sandy Bay, on the other side of the island, and the people seeing a very large shark under the stern, put out a hook with a piece of pork, and caught him; they opened him, and found inside of him, to their horror, the whole of the body of the soldier, except the legs below the knees: the monster had swallowed him whole, with the exception of his legs, which it had nipped off when it closed its jaws.""",soldier stand rock rock water swell break shark swim blow tail turn same way trip water deep comrade frighten run barrack tell story week schooner other side island person see large shark stern put hook piece pork catch open find horror whole body soldier leg knee monster swallow whole exception leg nip close jaw 
14,"""I really had no idea that they were so bold, Ready.""",have idea bold ready 
15,"""It is a fact, I assure you; and therefore we cannot be too careful how we go into the water: you saw how soon the poor pig was despatched.""",fact assure careful go water see poor pig despatch 
16,"""I wonder how the pigs get on, Ready,"" said William.",wonder pig get ready say 
17,"""I dare say they have littered by this time, sir; they have no want of food.""",say litter time sir have want food 
18,"""But can they eat the cocoa-nuts?""",eat cocoa nut 
19,"""Not the old ones, but they can the young ones, which are constantly dropping from the trees, and then there's plenty of roots for them.  If we stay long here we shall soon have good sport hunting them; but we must be very careful; for although they were tame pigs when we brought them on shore, they will be wild and very savage in a very short time.""",old one young one drop tree be plenty root stay have good sport hunt careful tame pig bring shore wild savage short time 
20,"""How must we hunt them?"" said Mr Seagrave.",hunt say 
21,"""Why, sir, with the dogs, and then shoot them.  I am glad that Vixen will have pups soon; we shall want more dogs.""",sir dog shoot glad have pup want more dog 
22,"""Shall we not have more mouths than we can find food for?""",have more mouth find food 
23,"""Never fear that, sir, as long as we have the sea to fish in.  Dogs live very well upon fish, even if it is raw.""",fear sir have sea fish dog live fish raw 
24,"""We shall have some lambs soon, Ready, shall we not?""",have lamb ready 
25,"""Yes, sir, I expect very soon.  I wish we had more food for the animals: they are put rather hard to it just now; but next year, if we find more food on the island, we must keep the grass near home, to make hay and stack it for the winter time--or the rainy season rather, for there is no winter in these latitudes.  I'm pretty sure we shall find some clear land on the south of the island, for the cocoa-nut grove does not extend so close to the water on that side as it does on the north.""",sir expect wish have more food animal put hard next year find more food island keep grass home make hay stack winter time rainy season be winter latitude sure find clear land south island cocoa nut grove extend water side north 
26,"""I do so long to go on our exploring party,"" said William.",do go exploring party say 
27,"""We must wait a little,"" replied Ready; ""but I don't know whether you will go; we must not all three go at once, and leave Mrs Seagrave alone.""",wait little reply ready know go go leave 
28,"""No,"" replied Mr Seagrave, ""that would not be fair; either you or I must remain, William.""",reply fair remain 
29,"William made no reply, but it was evident that he was annoyed at the idea of not being of the party.  They worked very hard that day, and the walls rose fast out of the water.",make reply evident annoyed idea party work day wall rise water 
30,"After supper, Ready continued his narrative.  ""We remained concealed until it was dark, and then Hastings and Romer, each with a musket on his shoulders and a ham at his back; and I, being the smallest, with the rifle and the great loaf of bread, set off on our journey.  Our intention was to travel north, as we knew that was the road leading from the colony; but Hastings had decided that we should first go to the eastward, so as to make what we sailors call a circumbendibus, which would keep us out of the general track.  We passed through the deep sands of False Bay, and after that gradually ascended, getting among brushwood and young trees; but we saw no signs of cultivation, nor did we pass one house after we had left False Bay astern of us.  About twelve o'clock we were very much fatigued, and longed for a drink of water, but we did not find any, although the moon shone as bright as day.  We distinctly heard, however, what we did not much like, the howling and cries of the wild beasts which increased as we went on; still we did not see any, and that was our comfort.  At last we were so tired that we all sat down on the ledge of a rock.  We dared not go to sleep, so we remained there till daylight, listening to the howling of the animals.  We none of us spoke, and I presume that Hastings' and Romer's thoughts were the same as my own, which were, that I would have given a great deal to find myself safe and sound again within the prison walls.  However, daylight came at last; the wild beasts did not prowl any more; we walked on till we found a stream of water, where we sat down and took our breakfast, after which our courage revived, and we talked and laughed as we walked on, just as we had done before.  We now began to ascend the mountains, which Hastings said must be the Black Mountains that the soldiers had talked to us about.  They were very desolate; and when night came on we collected brushwood, and cut down branches with our knives, that we might make a fire, not only to warm ourselves, but to scare away the wild beasts, whose howling had already commenced.  We lighted our fire and ate our supper; the loaf was half gone, and the hams had been well cut into--we knew, therefore, that very soon we should have to trust to our guns for procuring food.  As soon as we had finished our meal, we lay down by the fire, with our muskets loaded close to us, and our ammunition placed out of danger.  We were so tired that we were soon fast asleep.  It had been agreed that Romer should keep the first watch, and Hastings the middle, and I the morning; but Romer fell asleep, and the consequence was, that the fire was not kept up.  It was about midnight that I was awakened by something breathing hard in my face, and just as I could recall my senses and open my eyes, I found myself lifted up by my waistband, and the teeth of some animal pinching my flesh.  I tried to catch at my musket, but I put out my wrong hand, and laid hold of a still lighted brand out of the fire, which I darted into the animal's face; it let me drop directly, and ran away.""",supper ready continue narrative remain conceal dark musket shoulder ham back small rifle great loaf bread set journey intention travel know road lead colony decide go eastward make sailor call circumbendibus keep general track pass deep sand false ascend get brushwood young tree see sign cultivation pass house leave false o'clock fatigued long drink water find moon shine bright day hear do howling cry wild beast increase go see comfort last tired sit ledge rock go sleep remain daylight listen howling animal speak presume thought same own give great deal find safe sound prison wall daylight come last wild beast prowl more walk find stream water sit take breakfast courage revive talk laugh walk do begin ascend mountain say black soldier talk desolate night come collect brushwood cut branch knife make fire warm scare wild beast howling commence light fire eat supper loaf half gone ham cut know have trust gun procure food finish meal lay fire musket load close ammunition place danger tired fast asleep agree keep first watch middle morning fall asleep consequence fire keep midnight awaken breathe face recall sense open eye find lift waistband tooth animal pinch flesh try catch musket put wrong hand lay hold light brand fire dart animal face let drop run 
31,"""What a providential escape!"" said Mrs Seagrave.",providential escape say 
32,"""Yes, it was, ma'am; the animal was a hyena.  Fortunately they are a very cowardly sort of beast; still, had it not been for the lighted stick, it would have carried me off, for I was very small then, and it lifted me up as if I was a feather in its mouth.  The shout I gave woke Hastings, who seized his musket and fired.  I was very much frightened, as you may suppose.  As for Romer, he never woke till we pushed him hard, he was so completely knocked up.  This affair, of course, made us more cautious, and afterwards we lighted two fires, and slept between them, one always remaining on the watch.  For a week we travelled on, and as soon as we were over the mountains, we turned our heads to the northward.  Our provisions were all gone, and we were one day without any; but we killed an antelope called a spring-bock, which gave us provisions for three or four days: there was no want of game after we had descended into the plain.  I forgot to mention, however, a narrow escape we had, just before we had left an extensive forest on the side of the mountain.  We had walked till past noon, and were very much tired; we decided upon taking our dinner under a large tree, and we threw ourselves down in the shade.  Hastings was lying on his back, with his eyes looking upwards, when he perceived on the lower branch of the tree a panther, which lay along it, his green eyes fixed upon us, and ready to spring; he seized his musket, and fired it without taking aim, for there was no time; but the ball entered the stomach of the animal, and, as it appeared, divided its back-bone.  Down came the beast, within three or four feet of where we lay, with a loud roar, and immediately crouched to spring upon Romer; but it could not, for the back-bone being broken, it had not any power in its hinder quarters, so it raised up its fore quarters, and then dropped down again.  I never saw such rage and fury in an animal in my life.  At first we were too much frightened to fire; but, perceiving that the beast could not spring, Hastings snatched the musket from Romer and shot it through the head.",animal hyena cowardly sort beast light stick carry small lift feather mouth shout give wake seize musket fire frighten suppose wake push knock affair course make cautious light fire sleep remain watch week travel mountain turn head northward provision gone day kill antelope call spring bock give provision day be want game descend plain forget mention narrow escape have leave extensive forest side mountain walk noon tired decide take dinner large tree throw shade lie back eye look perceive low branch tree panther lay green eye fix ready spring seize musket fire take aim be time ball enter stomach animal appear divide back bone come beast foot lay loud roar crouch spring back bone break have power hinder quarter raise fore quarter drop see such rage fury animal life first frighten fire perceive beast spring snatch musket shoot head 
33,"""We were now obliged to hunt for our livelihood, and we became bolder than ever.  Our clothes were all in rags; but we had plenty of powder and ammunition; there were hundreds and hundreds of antelopes and gnus in the plain--indeed, sometimes it was impossible to count them.  But this plentiful supply of game was the cause of our being in greater danger, for now, for the first time, we heard the roar of the lions every night.  We made large fires to keep them off, but they often made us tremble when they came near to us.""",oblige hunt livelihood become bold clothes rag have plenty powder ammunition be hundred hundred antelope gnus plain impossible count plentiful supply game cause great danger first time hear roar lion night make large fire keep make tremble come 
34,"""Did you ever meet with one in the day-time?"" said William.",meet day time say 
35,"""Yes, sir; we often saw them, but they never attacked us, and we were too much afraid to fire at them.  Once we met one face to face.  We had killed an antelope called a hartebeest, and, with our muskets on our shoulders, were running to secure it.  Just as we came up to the spot, we heard a roar, and found ourselves not ten yards from a lion, who was lying on the top of the beast we had killed, his eyes flashing fire at us, and half raising himself, as if ready for a spring.  We all took to our heels as fast as we could.  I never looked back till I was out of breath: but the lion was content with our running away, and did not take the trouble to follow us.  Well, sir, we had been travelling, we really hardly knew where, but certainly in a northerly direction, for three weeks, and were quite worn out: we now all agreed that we had done a very foolish thing, and would gladly have gone back again.  For my part, I declare that I was willing to lie down and die, if I could have so done, and I became quite indifferent to the roaring of the lions, and felt as if I should be glad if one would have made a meal of me.  At length, one morning, we fell in with a party of natives.  They were of the Karroo tribe, as they told us by pointing to themselves, and saying, `Karroos', and then they pointed to us, and said `Dutch'.  We shot game, and gave it to them, which pleased them very much, and they remained with us for five or six days.  We tried by signs to inquire of them, if there were any Dutch settlement about there; and they understood us, and said that there was, in a direction which they pointed out to us, to the north-east.  We offered them a present if they would show us the way. Two of the men agreed to go with us; the rest of the tribe, with the women and children, went southward.  The next day we arrived at a Dutch settlement of three or four farmhouses, called Graaff Reinet; but I must leave off now, for it is past bed-time.""",sir see attack afraid fire meet face face kill antelope call hartebeest musket shoulder run secure come spot hear roar find yard lion lie top beast kill eye flash fire half raise ready spring take heel look breath lion content running take trouble follow sir travel know northerly direction week wear agree do foolish thing go part declare willing lie die do become indifferent roaring lion feel glad make meal length morning fall party native tribe tell point say point say shoot game give pleased remain day try sign inquire be dutch settlement understand say be direction point north east offer present show way man agree go rest tribe woman child go next day arrive dutch settlement farmhouse call leave past bed time
