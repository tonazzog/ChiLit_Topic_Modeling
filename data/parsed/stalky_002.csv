1,CHAPTER 2. SLAVES OF THE LAMP,chapter slave lamp 
2," The music-room on the top floor of Number Five was filled with the “Aladdin” company at rehearsal. Dickson Quartus, commonly known as Dick Four, was Aladdin, stage-manager, ballet-master, half the orchestra, and largely librettist, for the “book” had been rewritten and filled with local allusions. The pantomime was to be given next week, in the down-stairs study occupied by Aladdin, Abanazar, and the Emperor of China. The Slave of the Lamp, with the Princess Badroulbadour and the Widow Twankay, owned Number Five study across the same landing, so that the company could be easily assembled. The floor shook to the stamp-and-go of the ballet, while Aladdin, in pink cotton tights, a blue and tinsel jacket, and a plumed hat, banged alternately on the piano and his banjo. He was the moving spirit of the game, as befitted a senior who had passed his Army Preliminary and hoped to enter Sandhurst next spring.",music room top floor fill company rehearsal know stage manager ballet master orchestra librettist book rewritt fill local allusion pantomime give next week down stair study occupy own number study same landing company assemble floor shake stamp go ballet pink cotton tight blue tinsel jacket plumed hat bang piano banjo move spirit game befit senior pass hope enter next spring

You two play it again,” said Beetle, who, in a gray skirt and a wig of chestnut sausage-curls, set slantwise above a pair of spectacles mended with an old boot-lace, represented the Widow Twankay.

The Slave of the Lamp climbed down from the piano, and dispassionately kicked him. “Play up, Turkey,” he said; “this is serious.” But there fell on the door the knock of authority.

Dick Four stood firm in the confidence born of well-fitting tights, but Beetle strove to efface himself behind the piano.

The old gang of criminals--allied forces of disorder--Corkran”--the Slave of the Lamp smiled politely--“McTurk”--the Irishman scowled--“and, of course, the unspeakable Beetle, our friend Gigadibs.” Abanazar, the Emperor, and Aladdin had more or less of characters, and King passed them over. “Come forth, my inky buffoon, from behind yonder instrument of music!

30,"In sign of his unruffled calm, King proceeded to tear Beetle, whom he called Gigadibs, slowly asunder. From his untied shoestrings to his mended spectacles (the life of a poet at a big school is hard) he held him up to the derision of his associates--with the usual result. His wild flowers of speech--King had an unpleasant tongue---restored him to good humor at the last. He drew a lurid picture of Beetle’s latter end as a scurrilous pamphleteer dying in an attic, scattered a few compliments over McTurk and Corkran, and, reminding Beetle that he must come up for judgment when called upon, went to Common-room, where he triumphed anew over his victims.",sign unruffled calm proceed tear call untied shoestring mend spectacle life poet big school hard hold derision associate usual result wild flower speech have unpleasant tongue restore good humor last draw lurid picture latter end scurrilous pamphleteer die attic scatter few compliment remind come judgment call go common room triumph victim

Thence he came back, greatly disordered, to find McTurk, Stalky, and the others of the company, in his study enjoying an unlimited “brew”--coffee, cocoa, buns, new bread hot and steaming, sardine, sausage, ham-and-tongue paste, pilchards, three jams, and at least as many pounds of Devonshire cream.",disappear flight stair flush small pink white boy form room next door study own chase corridor form room sacred revel lower come disorder find other company study enjoy unlimited brew coffee cocoa bun new bread hot steaming sardine sausage ham tongue paste pilchard jam least many pound cream

Beetle had quietly annexed the book, and had seen--several things. The quarter-comprehended verses lived and ate with him, as the bedropped pages showed.

123,"No sooner had the key turned in the door than the lid of the coal-box, which was also the window-seat, lifted cautiously. It had been a tight fit, even for the lithe Stalky, his head between his knees, and his stomach under his right ear. From a drawer in the table he took a well-worn catapult, a handful of buckshot, and a duplicate key of the study; noiselessly he raised the window and kneeled by it, his face turned to the road, the wind-sloped trees, the dark levels of the Burrows, and the white line of breakers falling nine-deep along the Pebbleridge. Far down the steep-banked Devonshire lane he heard the husky hoot of the carrier’s horn. There was a ghost of melody in it, as it might have been the wind in a gin-bottle essaying to sing, “It’s a way we have in the Army.”",have key turn door lid coal box window seat lift tight fit lithe head knee stomach right ear drawer table take wear catapult handful buckshot duplicate key study raise window kneel face turn road wind slope tree dark level white line breaker fall deep steep bank lane hear husky hoot carrier horn be ghost melody wind gin -bottle essay sing way have

127,"“And so,” King was saying in a high head voice to Beetle, whom he had kept to play with before Manders minor, well knowing that it hurts a Fifth-form boy to be held up to a fag’s derision, “and so, Master Beetle, in spite of all our verses, which we are so proud of, when we presume to come into direct conflict with even so humble a representative of authority as myself, for instance, we are turned out of our studies, are we not?”",say high head voice keep play minor know hurt fifth form boy hold fag derision spite verse proud presume come direct conflict humble representative authority instance turn study

132,"Beetle’s heart leaped up within him. Somewhere, somehow, he knew, Stalky moved behind these manifestations. There were hope and the prospect of revenge. He would embody the suggestion about the nose in deathless verse. King threw up the window, and sternly rebuked Rabbits-Eggs. But the carrier was beyond fear or fawning. He had descended from the cart, and was stooping by the roadside.",heart leap know move manifestation be hope prospect revenge embody suggestion nose deathless verse throw window rebuke rabbit egg carrier fear fawning descend cart stoop roadside 
133,"It all fell swiftly as a dream. Manders minor raised his hand to his head with a cry, as a jagged flint cannoned on to some rich tree-calf bindings in the book-shelf. Another quoited along the writing-table. Beetle made zealous feint to stop it, and in that endeavor overturned a student’s lamp, which dripped, _via_ King’s papers and some choice books, greasily on to a Persian rug. There was much broken glass on the window-seat; the china basket--McTurk’s aversion--cracked to flinders, had dropped her musk plant and its earth over the red rep cushions; Manders minor was bleeding profusely from a cut on the cheek-bone; and King, using strange words, every one of which Beetle treasured, ran forth to find the school-sergeant, that Rabbits-Eggs might be instantly cast into jail.",fall dream minor raise hand head cry jagged flint cannon rich tree calf binding book shelf quoit writing table make zealous feint stop endeavor overturn student lamp dripp paper choice book persian rug be much break glass window seat china basket aversion crack drop musk plant earth red rep cushion minor bleed cut cheek bone use strange word treasure run find school sergeant rabbit egg cast jail 
134,"“Poor chap!” said Beetle, with a false, feigned sympathy. “Let it bleed a little.

135,"Then did Beetle, alone with the wreckage, return good for evil. How, in that office, a complete set of “Gibbon” was scarred all along the back as by a flint; how so much black and copying ink came to be mingled with Manders’s gore on the table-cloth; why the big gum-bottle, unstoppered, had rolled semicircularly across the floor; and in what manner the white china door-knob grew to be painted with yet more of Manders’s young blood, were matters which Beetle did not explain when the rabid King returned to find him standing politely over the reeking hearth-rug.",alone wreckage return good evil office complete set scarr back flint much black copy ink come mingle gore table cloth big gum bottle unstopper roll floor manner white china door knob grow paint more young blood matter explain rabid return find stand reeking hearth rug

So it was McTurk, of the wooden visage, who brought the clothes from the dormitory while Beetle panted on a form. Then the three buried themselves in Number Five lavatory, turned on all the taps, filled the place with steam, and dropped weeping into the baths, where they pieced out the war.",stagger form room next door delegate duty unenlightened hysterical precis campaign wooden visage bring clothes dormitory pant form bury lavatory turn tap fill place steam drop weep bath piece war

151,"“Shockin’!” said Stalky, collapsing in a helpless welter of half-hitched trousers. “So dam’ bad, too, for innocent boys like us! Wonder what they’d say at ‘St. Winifred’s, or the World of School.’--By gum! That reminds me we owe the Lower Third one for assaultin’ Beetle when he chivied Manders minor. Come on!

152,"The Lower Third had set a guard upon their form-room for the space of a full hour, which to a boy is a lifetime. Now they were busy with their Saturday evening businesses--cooking sparrows over the gas with rusty nibs; brewing unholy drinks in gallipots; skinning moles with pocket-knives; attending to paper trays full of silkworms, or discussing the iniquities of their elders with a freedom, fluency, and point that would have amazed their parents. The blow fell without warning. Stalky upset a form crowded with small boys among their own cooking utensils, McTurk raided the untidy lockers as a terrier digs at a rabbit-hole, while Beetle poured ink upon such heads as he could not appeal to with a Smith’s Classical Dictionary. Three brisk minutes accounted for many silkworms, pet larvae, French exercises, school caps, half-prepared bones and skulls, and a dozen pots of home-made sloe jam. It was a great wreckage, and the form-room looked as though three conflicting tempests had smitten it.",lower set guard form room space full hour boy lifetime busy evening business cooking sparrow gas rusty nib brew unholy drink gallipot skinn mole pocket knife attend paper tray full silkworm discuss iniquity elder freedom fluency point amaze parent blow fall warning upset form crowd small boy own cooking utensil raid untidy locker terrier dig rabbit hole pour ink such head appeal classical brisk minute account many silkworm pet larvae french exercise school cap half prepare bone skull pot home make sloe jam great wreckage form room look conflict tempest smite 
153,"“Phew!” said Stalky, drawing breath outside the door (amid groans of “Oh, you beastly ca-ads! You think yourselves awful funny,” and so forth). “_That’s_ all right.
