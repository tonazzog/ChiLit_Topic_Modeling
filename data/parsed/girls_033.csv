1,CHAPTER 33. UNTRUSTWORTHY.,untrustworthy 
2,"Dora Russell had declared, in Hester's presence, and with intense energy in her manner, that the author of the insult to which she had been exposed should be publicly punished, and, if possible, expelled.  On the evening of her interview with the head teacher, she had so far forgotten herself as to reiterate this desire with extreme vehemence.  She had boldly declared her firm conviction of Annie's guilt, and had broadly hinted at Mrs Willis's favouritism toward her.  The great dignity, however, of her teacher's manner, and the half-sorrowful, half-indignant look she bestowed on the excited girl, calmed her down after a time. Mrs Willis felt full sympathy for Dora, and could well understand how trying and aggravating this practical joke must be to so proud a girl; but although her faith was undoubtedly shaken in Annie, she would not allow this sentiment to appear.",declare presence intense energy manner author insult expose punish possible expel evening interview head teacher forget reiterate desire extreme vehemence declare firm conviction guilt hint favouritism great dignity teacher manner half sorrowful half indignant look bestow excited girl calm time feel full sympathy understand try aggravate practical joke proud girl faith shake allow sentiment appear 
3,"""I will do all I can for you, Dora,"" she said, when the weeping Annie had left the room; ""I will do everything in my power to find out who has injured you.  Annie has absolutely denied the accusation you bring against her, and unless her guilt can be proved it is but right to believe her innocent.  There are many other girls in Lavender House; and to-morrow morning I will sift this unpleasant affair to the very bottom. Go, now, my dear, and if you have sufficient self-command and self-control, try to have courage to write your essay over again.  I have no doubt that your second rendering of your subject will be more attractive than the first.  Beginners cannot too often re-write their themes.""",do say weeping leave room do power find injure deny accusation bring guilt prove right believe innocent be many other girl morning sift unpleasant affair very bottom go dear have sufficient self command self control try have courage write essay have doubt second rendering subject attractive first beginner re-write theme 
4,"Dora gave her head a proud little toss, but she was sufficiently in awe of Mrs Willis to keep back any retort, and she went out of the room feeling unsatisfied and wretched, and inclined for a sympathising chat with her little friend, Hester Thornton.",give head proud little toss awe keep retort go room feel unsatisfied wretch inclined sympathise chat little friend 
5,"Hester, however, when she reached her, seemed not at all disposed to talk to anyone.",reach seem dispose talk 
6,"""I've had it all out with Mrs Willis, and there is no doubt she will be exposed to-morrow morning,"" said Dora, half aloud.",have be doubt expose morning say half aloud 
7,"Hester, whose head was bent over her French history, looked up with an annoyed expression.",head bend french history look annoy expression 
8,"""Who will be exposed?"" she asked, in a petulant voice.",expose ask petulant voice 
9,"""Oh, how stupid you are growing, Hester Thornton!"" exclaimed Dora; ""why, that horrid Annie Forest, of course--but really I have no patience to talk to you; you have lost all your spirit.  I was very foolish to demean myself by taking so much notice of one of the little girls.""",stupid grow exclaim horrid course have patience talk lose spirit foolish demean take much notice little girl 
10,"Dora sailed down the play-room to her own drawing-room, fully expecting Hester to rise and rush after her; but to her surprise Hester did not stir, but sat with her head bent over her book, and her cheeks slightly flushed.",sail play room own draw room expect rise rush surprise stir sit head bend book cheek flush 
11,"The next morning Mrs Willis kept her word to Dora, and made the very strictest inquiries with regard to the practical joke to which Dora had been subjected.  She first of all fully explained what had taken place in the presence of the whole school, and then each girl was called up in rotation, and asked two questions: first, had she done this mischievous thing herself? second, could she throw any light on the subject?",next morning keep word make strictest inquiry regard practical joke subject explain take place presence whole school girl call rotation ask question do mischievous thing throw light subject 
12,"One by one each girl appeared before her teacher, replied in the negative to both queries, and returned to her seat.",girl appear teacher reply negative query return seat 
13,"""Now, girls,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you have each of you denied this charge.  Such a thing as has happened to Dora could not have been done without hands.  The teachers in the school are above suspicion; the servants are none of them clever enough to perform this base trick.  I suspect one of you, and I am quite determined to get at the truth. During the whole of this half-year there has been a spirit of unhappiness, of mischief, and of suspicion in our midst.  Under these circumstances love cannot thrive; under these circumstances the true and ennobling sense of brotherly kindness, and all those feelings which real religion prompt must languish.  I tell you all now plainly that I will not have this thing in Lavender House.  It is simply disgraceful for one girl to play such tricks on her fellows.  This is not the first time nor the second time that the school-desks have been tampered with.  I will find out--I am determined to find out, who this dishonest person is; and as she has not chosen to confess to me, as she has preferred falsehood to truth, I will visit her, when I do discover her, with my very gravest displeasure.  In this school I have always endeavoured to inculcate the true principles of honour and of trust.  I have laid down certain broad rules, and expect them to be obeyed; but I have never hampered you with petty and humiliating restraints.  I have given you a certain freedom, which I believed to be for your best good, and I have never suspected one of you until you have given me due cause.",girl say have deny charge thing happen do hand teacher school suspicion servant clever perform base trick suspect determined get truth whole half year be spirit unhappiness mischief suspicion midst circumstance love thrive circumstance true ennobling sense brotherly kindness feeling real religion prompt languish tell have thing disgraceful girl play such trick fellow first time second time school desk tamper find determined find dishonest person choose confess prefer falsehood truth visit discover gravest displeasure school endeavour inculcate true principle honour trust lay certain broad rule expect obey hamper petty humiliating restraint give certain freedom believe good good suspect give due cause 
14,"""Now, however, I tell you plainly that I alter all my tactics.  One girl sitting in this room is guilty.  For her sake I shall treat you all as guilty, and punish you accordingly.  For the remainder of this term, or until the hour when the guilty girl chooses to release her companions, you are all, with the exception of the little children and Miss Russell, who can scarcely have played this trick on herself, under punishment.  I withdraw your half-holidays--I take from you the use of the South Parlour for your acting, and every drawing-room in the play-room is confiscated.  But this, is not all that I do.  In taking from you my trust, I must treat you as untrustworthy--you will no longer enjoy the liberty you used to delight in--everywhere you will be watched.  A teacher will sit in your play-room with you, a teacher will accompany you into the grounds, and I tell you plainly, girls, that chance words and phrases which drop from your lips shall be taken up, and used, if necessary, to the elucidation of this disgraceful mystery.""",tell alter tactic girl sit room guilty sake treat guilty punish remainder term hour guilty girl choose release companion exception little child play trick punishment withdraw half holiday take use acting draw room play room confiscate do take trust treat untrustworthy enjoy liberty use delight watch teacher sit play room teacher accompany grounds tell girl chance word phrase drop lip take use necessary elucidation disgraceful mystery 
15,"Here Mrs Willis left the room, and the teachers desired the several girls in their classes to attend to their morning studies.",leave room teacher desire several girl class attend morning study 
16,"Nothing could exceed the dismay which her words had produced.  The innocent girls were fairly stunned, and from that hour for many a day all sunshine and happiness seemed really to have left Lavender House.",exceed dismay word produce innocent girl stunn hour many day sunshine happiness seem leave 
17,"The two, however, who felt the change most acutely, and on whose altered faces their companions began to fix suspicious eyes, were Annie Forest and Hester Thornton.  Hester was burdened with an intolerable sense of the shameful falsehood she had told; Annie, guilty in another matter, succumbed at last utterly to a sense of misery and injustice.  Her orphaned and lonely position for the first time began to tell on her; she ate little and slept little, her face grew very pale and thin, and her health really suffered.",feel change alter face companion begin fix suspicious eye burden intolerable sense shameful falsehood tell guilty matter succumb last sense misery injustice orphaned lonely position first time begin tell eat little sleep little face grow pale thin health suffer 
18,"All the routine of happy life at Lavender House was changed.  In the large play-room the drawing-rooms were unused; there were no pleasant little knots of girls whispering happily and confidentially together, for whenever two or three girls sat down to have a chat they found that one or another of the teachers was within hearing.  The acting for the coming play progressed so languidly that no one expected it would really take place, and the one relief and relaxation to the unhappy girls lay in the fact that the holidays were not far off, and that in the meantime they might work hard for the prizes.",routine happy life change large play room draw room unused be pleasant little knot girl whisper girl sit have chat find teacher hearing acting come play progress expect take place relief relaxation unhappy girl lay fact holiday meantime work prize 
19,"The days passed in a truly melancholy fashion, and, perhaps, for the first time the girls fully appreciated the old privileges of freedom and trust which were now forfeited.  There was a feeble little attempt at a joke and a laugh in the school at Dora's expense.  The most frivolous of the girls whispered of her as she passed as ""the muddy stream;"" but no one took up the fun with avidity--the shadow of somebody's sin had fallen too heavily upon all the bright young lives.",day pass melancholy fashion first time girl appreciate old privilege freedom trust forfeit be feeble little attempt joke laugh school expense frivolous girl whisper pass muddy stream take fun avidity shadow sin fall bright young life
