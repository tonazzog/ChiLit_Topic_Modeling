1,CHAPTER XXIV. ANOTHER EARLY BIRD,xxiv. early bird 
2," HE GOT up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard. He tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed, and then went out, leaving the door open, so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once. When he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened.",get morning hear man move yard tuck little brother tumble bed go leave door open cry mother hear get yard find stable door open 
3,"“I’m the early bird, I think,” he said to himself. “I hope I shall catch the worm.”",early bird think say hope catch worm 
4,"He would not ask any one to help him, fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition. With great difficulty, but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom, he managed to put the harness on Diamond. If the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding, of course he could not have done it; but even when it came to the bridle, he opened his mouth for the bit, just as if he had been taking the apple which Diamond sometimes gave him. He fastened the cheek-strap very carefully, just in the usual hole, for fear of choking his friend, or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth. It was a job to get the saddle on; but with the chair he managed it. If old Diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel, he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back, but that was more than could be expected of him, and then Diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth. The collar was almost the worst part of the business; but there Diamond could help Diamond. He held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round, and then he lifted his head, and shook it on to his shoulders. The yoke was rather difficult; but when he had laid the traces over the horse’s neck, the weight was not too much for him. He got him right at last, and led him out of the stable.",ask one help fear project meet disapproval opposition great difficulty help break chair bring bedroom manage put harness old horse have least objection proceeding course do come bridle open mouth bit take apple give fasten cheek strap usual hole fear choke friend let bit get tooth job get saddle chair manage old have education physics equal camel knolt let put back more expect have creep get hold girth collar bad part business help hold head low little master get turn lift head shake shoulder yoke difficult lay trace horse neck weight much get last lead stable 
5,"By this time there were several of the men watching him, but they would not interfere, they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties. They followed him as far as the stable-door, and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts, got them up one after the other into the loops, fastened the traces, the belly-band, the breeching, and the reins.",time be several man watch interfere anxious see get various difficulty follow stable door stand watch put horse shaft get other loop fasten trace belly band breeching rein 
6,"Then he got his whip. The moment he mounted the box, the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success. But they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness; and although they found it right, for not a buckle had to be shifted, they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill.",get whip moment mount box man break hearty cheer delight success let go general inspection harness find right buckle have shift allow do time father ill 
7,"The cheer brought his mother to the window, and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning. She tugged at the window, but it was stiff; and before she could open it, Diamond, who was in a great hurry, was out of the mews, and almost out of the street. She called “Diamond! Diamond!” but there was no answer except from Jack.",cheer bring mother window see little boy set cab gray morning tug window stiff open great hurry mew street call diamond be answer 
8,"“Never fear for him, ma’am,” said Jack. “It ‘ud be only a devil as would hurt him, and there ain’t so many o’ them as some folk ‘ud have you believe. A boy o’ Diamond’s size as can ‘arness a ‘oss t’other Diamond’s size, and put him to, right as a trivet--if he do upset the keb--‘ll fall on his feet, ma’am.”",fear say devil hurt many folk ‘ud believe boy size arness oss t’other size put right trivet upset keb fall foot

13,"“A good deal better, thank you,” she answered, closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of Diamond’s expedition. He knew pretty well, however, what his boy was capable of, and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother. But as the evening drew on, the anxiety of both of them increased, and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed, and his mother peep out of the window.",good deal good thank answer close window fear husband make anxious news expedition know boy capable easy anxious mother evening draw anxiety increase sound wheel make father raise bed mother peep window 
14,"Diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known, and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers. Before he got across Oxford Street, however, he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train, and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver. Having carried him to King’s Cross in good time, and got a good fare in return, he set off again in great spirits, and reached the stand in safety. He was the first there after all.",resolve go cab stand know crawl fear annoy idler get hail man want catch train great hurry think driver carry good time get good fare return set great spirit reach stand safety first

37,"“I’ll risk it,” said the gentleman; and, opening the door himself, he jumped in.",risk say gentleman open door jump 
38,"He was going a good distance, and soon found that Diamond got him over the ground well. Now when Diamond had only to go straight ahead, and had not to mind so much what he was about, his thoughts always turned to the riddle Mr. Raymond had set him; and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him. He had given up all hope of finding it out for himself, and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill. He had thought of the answer himself, but fancied it could not be the right one, for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology. So, when he reached the end of his journey, he got down very quickly, and with his head just looking in at the window, said, as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers:",go good distance find get ground have go have mind much thought turn riddle set gentleman look clever fancy able read give hope find plague father ill think answer fancy right one see fit require knowledge physiology reach end journey get head look window say gentleman gather glove newspaper

59,"“I hope it may, my man. I shouldn’t wonder if you’re as good as you look, after all.”",hope man wonder good look 
60,"As Diamond returned, he drew up at a stand he had never been on before: it was time to give Diamond his bag of chopped beans and oats. The men got about him, and began to chaff him. He took it all good-humouredly, until one of them, who was an ill-conditioned fellow, began to tease old Diamond by poking him roughly in the ribs, and making general game of him. That he could not bear, and the tears came in his eyes. He undid the nose-bag, put it in the boot, and was just going to mount and drive away, when the fellow interfered, and would not let him get up. Diamond endeavoured to persuade him, and was very civil, but he would have his fun out of him, as he said. In a few minutes a group of idle boys had assembled, and Diamond found himself in a very uncomfortable position. Another cab drew up at the stand, and the driver got off and approached the assemblage.",return draw stand time give bag choppe bean oat man get begin chaff take good ill condition fellow begin tease old poke rib make general game bear tear come eye undid nose bag put boot go mount drive fellow interfer let get endeavour persuade civil have fun say few minute group idle boy assemble find uncomfortable position cab draw stand driver get approach assemblage

69,"His mother had got very anxious indeed--so much so that she was almost afraid, when she did hear the sound of his cab, to go and look, lest she should be yet again disappointed, and should break down before her husband.

But then, don’t you see?                Before that could be,             The moon had come down and listened.
