2,"     A cloud was o’er my childhood’s dream,            I sat in solitude;      I know not how--I know not why,      But round my soul all drearily            There was a silent shroud.                    --THOUGHTS IN PAST YEARS",cloud childhood dream sit solitude know know soul be silent shroud past year 
3," Mrs. Edmonstone was anxious to hear Mr. Lascelle’s opinion of his pupil, and in time she learnt that he thought Sir Guy had very good abilities, and a fair amount of general information; but that his classical knowledge was far from accurate, and mathematics had been greatly neglected. He had been encouraged to think his work done when he had gathered the general meaning of a passage, or translated it into English verse, spirited and flowing, but often further from the original than he or his tutor could perceive. He had never been taught to work, at least as other boys study, and great application would be requisite to bring his attainments to a level with those of far less clever boys educated at a public school.",anxious hear opinion pupil time learn think have good ability fair amount general information classical knowledge accurate mathematics neglect encourage think work do gather general meaning passage translate english verse spirit flow original tutor perceive teach work least other boy study great application requisite bring attainment level clever boy educate public school 
4,"Mr. Lascelles told him so at first; but as there were no reflections on his grandfather, or on Mr. Potts, Guy’s lip did not suffer, and he only asked how many hours a day he ought to read. ‘Three,’ said Mr. Lascelles, with a due regard to a probable want of habits of application; but then, remembering how much was undone, he added, that ‘it ought to be four or more, if possible.’",tell first be reflection grandfather lip suffer ask many hour day read say due regard probable want habit application remember much undone add more possible 
5,"‘Four it _shall_ be,’ said Guy; ‘five if I can.’",_shall_ say guy 
6,"His whole strength of will was set to accomplish these four hours, taking them before and after breakfast, working hard all the morning till the last hour before luncheon, when he came to read the lectures on poetry with Charles. Here, for the first time, it appeared that Charles had so entirely ceased to consider him as company, as to domineer over him like his own family.",whole strength will set accomplish hour take breakfast work morning last hour luncheon come read lecture poetry first time appear cease consider company domineer own family 
7,"Used as Guy had been to an active out-of-doors life, and now turned back to authors he had read long ago, to fight his way through the construction of their language, not excusing himself one jot of the difficulty, nor turning aside from one mountain over which his own efforts could carry him, he found his work as tough and tedious as he could wish or fear, and by the end of the morning was thoroughly fagged. Then would have been the refreshing time for recreation in that pleasant idling-place, the Hollywell drawing-room. Any other time of day would have suited Charles as well for the reading, but he liked to take the hour at noon, and never perceived that this made all the difference to his friend of a toil or a pleasure. Now and then Guy gave tremendous yawns; and once when Charles told him he was very stupid, proposed a different time; but as Charles objected, he yielded as submissively as the rest of the household were accustomed to do.",use guy active door life turn author read fight way construction language excuse jot difficulty turn mountain own effort carry find work tough tedious wish fear end morning fagg refresh time recreation pleasant idling place draw room other time day suit reading like take hour noon perceive make difference friend toil pleasure give tremendous yawn tell stupid propose different time object yield rest household accustom do 
8,"To watch Guy was one of Charles’s chief amusements, and he rejoiced greatly in the prospect of hearing his history of his first dinner-party. Mr., Mrs. and Miss Edmonstone, and Sir Guy Morville, were invited to dine with Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow. Mr. Edmonstone was delighted as usual with any opportunity of seeing his neighbours; Guy looked as if he did not know whether he liked the notion or not; Laura told him it would be very absurd and stupid, but there would be some good music, and Charles ordered her to say no more, that he might have the account, the next morning, from a fresh and unprejudiced mind.",watch chief amusement rejoice prospect hear history first dinner party invite dine delight usual opportunity see neighbour guy look know like notion tell absurd stupid be good music order say more have account next morning fresh unprejudiced mind

I wonder if he is conscious of it.’",help think say guy apologise watch manner imitation look droller think absence presence wonder conscious

61,"There was no reply, and presently Guy asked whether he would go up to dress? Having no other way of showing his displeasure, he refused, and remained nursing his ill-humour, till he forgot how slight the offence had been, and worked himself into a sort of insane desire--half mischievous, half revengeful--to be as provoking as he could in his turn.",be reply guy ask go dress have other way show displeasure refuse remain nurse ill humour forget slight offence work sort insane desire half mischievous half revengeful provoking turn 
62,"Seldom had he been more contrary, as his old nurse was wont to call it. No one could please him, and Guy was not allowed to do anything for him. Whatever he said was intended to rub on some sore place in Guy’s mind. His mother and Laura’s signs made him worse, for he had the pleasure of teasing them, also; but Guy endured it all with perfect temper, and he grew more cross at his failure; yet, from force of habit, at bed-time, he found himself on the stairs with Guy’s arm supporting him.",contrary old nurse call please allow do say intend rub sore place mind mother sign make bad have pleasure tease guy endure perfect temper grow cross failure force habit bed time find stair arm support

65,"Now that the idea of ‘poking up the lion’ had once occurred, it became his great occupation to attempt it. He wanted to see some evidence of the fiery temper, and it was a new sport to try to rouse it; one, too, which had the greater relish, as it kept the rest of the family on thorns.",idea poke lion occur become great occupation attempt want see evidence fiery temper new sport try rouse have great relish keep rest family thorn 
66,"He would argue against his real opinion, talk against his better sense, take the wrong side, and say much that was very far from his true sentiments. Guy could not understand at first, and was quite confounded at some of the views he espoused, till Laura came to his help, greatly irritating her brother by hints that he was not in earnest. Next time she could speak to Guy alone, she told him he must not take all Charles said literally.",argue real opinion talk good sense take wrong side say much true sentiment guy understand first confound view espouse come help irritate brother hint earnest next time speak tell take say

69,"From that time Guy seemed to have no trouble in reining in his temper in arguing with Charles, except once, when the lion was fairly roused by something that sounded like a sneer about King Charles I.",time seem have trouble rein temper argue lion rouse sound sneer 
70,"His whole face changed, his hazel eye gleamed with light like an eagle’s, and he started up, exclaiming--",whole face change hazel eye gleam light eagle start exclaim

73,"‘Ungenerous, unmanly,’ said Guy, his voice low, but quivering with indignation; ‘ungenerous to reproach him with what he so bitterly repented. Could not his penitence, could not his own blood’--but as he spoke, the gleam of wrath faded, the flush deepened on the cheek, and he left the room.",ungenerous unmanly say guy voice low quiver indignation ungenerous reproach repent penitence own blood speak gleam wrath fade flush deepen cheek leave room 
74,"‘Ha!’ soliloquized Charles, ‘I’ve done it! I could fancy his wrath something terrific when it was once well up. I didn’t know what was coming next; but I believe he has got himself pretty well in hand. It is playing with edge tools; and now I have been favoured with one flash of the Morville eye, I’ll let him alone; but it _ryled_ me to be treated as something beneath his anger, like a woman or a child.’",soliloquize do fancy wrath terrific know come believe get hand play edge tool favour flash eye let _ryle treat anger woman child

80,"His brow darkened into a stern, grave expression, so entirely in earnest, that Charles, though making no answer, could not do otherwise than feel compliance unavoidable. Charles had never been so entirely conquered, yet, strange to say, he was not, as usual, rendered sullen.",brow darken stern grave expression earnest make answer do feel compliance unavoidable conquer strange say usual render sullen

88,"‘Yes,’ said Guy, thoughtfully, ‘it may be foolish, but I do not feel as if one could do so with King Charles. He is too near home; he suffered to much from scoffs and railings; his heart was too tender, his repentance too deep for his friends to add one word even in jest to the heap of reproach. How one would have loved him!’ proceeded Guy, wrapped up in his own thoughts,--‘loved him for the gentleness so little accordant with the rude times and the part he had to act--served him with half like a knight’s devotion to his lady-love, half like devotion to a saint, as Montrose did--",say guy foolish feel do home suffer much scoff railing heart tender repentance deep friend add word jest heap reproach love proceed guy wrap own thought love gentleness little accordant rude time part have act serve half knight devotion lady love half devotion saint

92,"‘I beg your pardon,’ said Guy, suddenly recalled, and colouring deeply; ‘I believe I forgot where I was, and have treated you to one of my old dreams in my boatings at home. You may quiz me as much as you please tomorrow. Good night.’",beg pardon say guy recall colour believe forget treat old dream boating home quiz tomorrow good night 
93,"‘It was a rhapsody!’ thought Charles; ‘yes it was. I wonder I don’t laugh at it; but I was naturally carried along. Fancy that! He did it so naturally; in fact, it was all from the bottom of his heart, and I could not quiz him--no, no more than Montrose himself. He is a strange article! But he keeps one awake, which is more than most people do!’",rhapsody think wonder laugh carry fancy do fact bottom heart quiz more strange article keep awake more most person do 
94,"Guy was indeed likely to keep every one awake just then; for Mr. Edmonstone was going to take him out hunting for the first time, and he was half wild about it. The day came, and half an hour before Mr. Edmonstone was ready, Guy was walking about the hall, checking many an incipient whistle, and telling every one that he was beforehand with the world, for he had read one extra hour yesterday, and had got through the others before breakfast. Laura thought it very true that, as Philip said, he was only a boy, and moralized to Charlotte on his being the same age as herself--very nearly eighteen. Mrs. Edmonstone told Charles it was a treat to see any one so happy, and when he began to chafe at the delay, did her best to beguile the time, but without much success. Guy had ever learned to wait patiently, and had a custom of marching up and down, and listening with his head thrown back, or, as Charles used to call it, ‘prancing in the hall.’",guy likely keep one go take hunt first time wild day come hour ready walk hall check many incipient whistle tell one world read extra hour yesterday get other breakfast think true say boy moralize same age tell treat see one happy begin chafe delay do good beguile time much success guy learn wait have custom march listen head throw use call prance hall 
95,"If Mrs. Edmonstone’s patience was tried by the preparation for the hunt in the morning, it was no less her lot to hear of it in the evening. Guy came home in the highest spirits, pouring out his delight to every one, with animation and power of description giving all he said a charm. The pleasure did not lose by repetition; he was more engrossed by it every time; and no one could be more pleased with his ardour than Mr. Edmonstone, who, proud of him and his riding, gave a sigh to past hopes of poor Charles, and promoted the hunting with far more glee that he had promoted the reading.",patience try preparation hunt morning lot hear evening guy come high spirit pour delight one animation power description give say charm pleasure lose repetition engross time pleased ardour proud riding give sigh past hope poor promote hunting more glee promote reading 
96,"The Redclyffe groom, William, whose surname of Robinson was entirely forgotten in the appellation of William of Deloraine, was as proud of Sir Guy as Mr. Edmonstone could be; but made representations to his master that he must not hunt Deloraine two days in the week, and ride him to Broadstone two more. Guy then walked to Broadstone; but William was no better pleased, for he thought the credit of Redclyffe compromised, and punished him by reporting Deloraine not fit to be used next hunting day. Mr. Edmonstone perceived that Guy ought to have another hunter; Philip heard of one for sale, and after due inspection all admired--even William, who had begun by remarking that there might be so many screw-looses about a horse, that a man did not know what to be at with them.",groom surname forget appellation proud make representation master hunt day week ride more guy walk pleased think credit compromise punish report fit use next hunting day perceive guy have hunter hear sale due inspection admire begin remark be many screw loose horse man know 
97,"Philip, who was conducting the negotiation, came to dine at Hollywell to settle the particulars. Guy was in a most eager state; and they and Mr. Edmonstone talked so long about horses, that they sent Charles to sleep; his mother began to read, and the two elder girls fell into a low, mysterious confabulation of their own till they were startled by a question from Philip as to what could engross them so deeply.",conduct negotiation come dine settle particular guy eager state talk horse send sleep mother begin read elder girl fall low mysterious confabulation own startle question engross

115,"Amy could not think how Philip could have gone on all this time; perhaps it was because he was not watching how Guy’s colour varied, how he bit his lip; and at last his eyes seemed to grow dark in the middle, and to sparkle with fire, as with a low, deep tone, like distant thunder, conveying a tremendous force of suppressed passion, he exclaimed, ‘Beware of trifling--’ then breaking off hastened out of the room.",think go time watch guy colour vary bite lip last eye seem grow dark middle sparkle fire low deep tone distant thunder convey tremendous force suppress passion exclaim beware trifl break hasten room

She was glad to see that her cousin was struck with it; he admired this care to maintain strict truth, and even opened a memorandum-book--the sight of which Charles dreaded--and read the following extract: ‘Do not think of one falsity as harmless, and another as slight, and another as unintended. Cast them all aside. They may be light and accidental, but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the pit, for all that; and it is better that our hearts should be swept clean of them, without over care as to which is the largest or blackest.’",think hear say proceed relate story glad see cousin strike admire care maintain strict truth open memorandum book sight dread read follow extract think falsity harmless slight unintended cast light accidental ugly soot smoke pit good heart sweep clean care large blackest

Amy was glad that her sister ventured to hint that he might be more cautious in avoiding collisions.,pleased go regret such excellent disposition couple such vehemence character unhappy temper glad sister venture hint cautious avoid collision

125,"‘He is sensitive,’ said Laura. ‘I don’t mean only in temper, but in everything. I wonder if it is part of his musical temperament to be as keenly alive to all around, as his ear is to every note. A bright day, a fine view, is such real happiness to him; he dwells on every beauty of Redclyffe with such affection; and then, when he reads, Charles says it is like going over the story again himself to watch his face act it in that unconscious manner.’",sensitive say mean temper wonder part musical temperament alive ear note bright day fine view such real happiness dwell beauty such affection read say go story watch face act unconscious manner

He took it up by chance, and stood reading it while all those strange expressions began to flit over his face, and at last he fairly cried over it so much, that he was obliged to fly out of the room.

The strength of will which had, in his own case, been the slave of his passions, had been turned inward to subdue the passions themselves, but this was only the beginning--the trial was not yet come. He could hope his grandson might repent, but this was the best that he dared to think possible. He could not believe that a Morville could pass unscathed through the world, or that his sins would not be visited on the head of his only descendant; and the tone of his narration was throughout such as might almost have made the foreboding cause its own accomplishment.",see bright blossom put boy grow old fruit dare believe strength will own case slave passion turn subdue passion beginning trial come hope grandson repent good dare think possible believe pass unscathed world sin visit head only descendant tone narration such make foreboding cause own accomplishment 
225,"The effect was beyond what he had expected; for a soul deeply dyed in guilt, even though loathing its own stains, had not the power of conceiving how foul was the aspect of vice, to one hitherto guarded from its contemplation, and living in a world of pure, lofty day-dreams. The boy sat the whole time without a word, his face bent down and hidden by his clasped hands, only now and then unable to repress a start or shudder at some fresh disclosure; and when it was ended, he stood up, gazed round, and walked uncertainly, as if he did not know where he was. His next impulse was to throw himself on his knee beside his grandfather, and caress him as he used to when a child. The ‘good-night’ was spoken, and Guy was shut into his room, with his overwhelming emotions.",effect expect soul dyed guilt loathing own stain have power conceive foul aspect vice guard contemplation live world pure lofty day dream boy sit whole time word face bend hide clasp hand unable repress start shudder fresh disclosure end stand gaze walk know next impulse throw knee grandfather caress use child good night speak guy shut room overwhelming emotion 
226,"His grandfather a blood-stained, remorseful man! The doom was complete, himself heir to the curse of Sir Hugh, and fated to run the same career; and as he knew full well, with the tendency to the family character strong within him, the germs of these hateful passions ready to take root downwards and bear fruit upwards, with the very countenance of Sir Hugh, and the same darkening, kindling eyes, of which traditions had preserved the remembrance.",grandfather blood stain remorseful man doom complete heir curse fated run same career know full tendency family character strong germ hateful passion ready take root bear fruit very countenance same darken kindle eye tradition preserve remembrance 
227,"He was crushed for awhile. The consciousness of strength not his own, of the still small voice that could subdue the fire, the earthquake, and the whirlwind, was slow in coming to him; and when it came, he, like his grandfather, had hope rather of final repentance than of keeping himself unstained.",crush consciousness strength own small voice subdue fire earthquake whirlwind slow come come grandfather have hope final repentance keep unstain 
228,"His mind had not recovered the shock when his grandfather died,--died in faith and fear, with good hope of accepted repentance, but unable to convey the assurance of such hope to his grandson. Grief for the only parent he had ever known, and the sensation of being completely alone in the world, were joined to a vague impression of horror at the suddenness of the stroke, and it was long before the influence of Hollywell, or the elasticity of his own youthfulness, could rouse him from his depression.",mind recover shock grandfather die die faith fear good hope accept repentance unable convey assurance such hope grandson grief only parent know sensation alone world join vague impression horror suddenness stroke long influence elasticity own youthfulness rouse depression 
229,"Even then it was almost against his will that he returned to enjoyment, unable to avoid being amused, but feeling as if joy was not meant for him, and as if those around were walking ‘in a world of light,’ where he could scarcely hope to tread a few uncertain steps. In this despondency was Guy’s chief danger, as it was likely to make him deem a struggle with temptation fruitless, while his high spirits and powers of keen enjoyment increased the peril of recklessness in the reaction.",will return enjoyment unable avoid amuse feel joy mean walk world light hope tread few uncertain step despondency chief danger likely make deem struggle temptation fruitless high spirit power keen enjoyment increase peril recklessness reaction 
230,"It was Mrs. Edmonstone who first spoke with him cheerfully of a successful conflict with evil, and made him perceive that his temptations were but such as is common to man. She had given him a clue to discover when and how to trust himself to enjoy; the story of Sintram had stirred him deeply, and this very day, Amy’s words, seemingly unheeded and unheard, had brought home to him the hope and encouragement of that marvellous tale.",speak successful conflict evil make perceive temptation such common man give clue discover trust enjoy story stirr very day word unheeded unheard bring hope encouragement marvellous tale 
231,"They had helped him in standing, looking steadfastly upwards, and treading down not merely evil, but the first token of coming evil, regardless of the bruises he might inflict on himself. Well for him if he was constant.",help standing look tread evil first token come evil bruise inflict constant 
232,"Such was Guy’s inner life; his outward life, frank and joyous, has been shown, and the two flowed on like a stream, pure as crystal, but into which the eye cannot penetrate from its depth. The surface would be sometimes obscured by cloud or shade, and reveal the sombre wells beneath; but more often the sunshine would penetrate the inmost recesses, and make them glance and sparkle, showing themselves as clear and limpid as the surface itself.",such inner life outward life frank joyous show flow stream pure crystal eye penetrate depth surface obscure cloud shade reveal sombre well sunshine penetrate inmost recesse make glance sparkle show clear limpid surface
