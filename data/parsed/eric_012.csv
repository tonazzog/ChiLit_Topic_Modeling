3,"On the Monday evening, the head boy reported to Dr. Rowlands that the perpetrator of the offence had not been discovered, but that one boy was very generally suspected, and on grounds that seemed plausible. ""I admit,"" he added, ""that from the little I know of him he seems to me a very unlikely sort of boy to do it.""",evening head boy report perpetrator offence discover boy suspect grounds seem plausible admit add little know seem unlikely sort boy do 
4,"""I think,"" suggested the Doctor, ""that the best way would be for you to have a regular trial on the subject, and hear the evidence.

7,"Avonley did as the Doctor suggested. At first, when the boys assembled, they seemed inclined to treat the matter as a joke, and were rather disorderly; but Avonley briefly begged them, if they determined to have a trial, to see that it was conducted sensibly; and by general consent he was himself voted into the desk as president. He then got up and said--",suggest first boy assemble seem inclined treat matter joke disorderly begg determine have trial see conduct general consent vote desk president get say 
8,"""There must be no sham or nonsense about this affair. Let all the boys take their seats quietly down the room.""",be sham nonsense affair let boy take seat room 
9,"They did so, and Avonley asked, ""Is Williams here?""",do ask 
10,"Looking round, they discovered he was not. Russell instantly went to the library to fetch him, and told him what was going on.

11,"""Are you willing to be tried, Williams,"" asked Avonley, ""on the charge of having written the insulting paper about Mr. Gordon?

12,"""There is nothing I should like better,"" said Eric.",be like good say 
13,"He had quite recovered his firm, manly bearing. A quiet conversation with his dearly loved friend and master had assured him in the confidence of innocence, and though the color on his cheek had through excitement sunk into two bright red spots, he looked wonderfully noble and winning as he stood before the boys in the centre of the room. His appearance caused a little reaction in his favor, and a murmur of applause followed his answer.",recover firm manly bear quiet conversation love friend master assure confidence innocence color cheek have excitement sink bright red spot look noble win stand boy centre room appearance cause little reaction favor murmur applause follow answer

23,"Another pause followed, and then, blushing crimson, Russell got up. ""I am only a Shell-boy,"" he said, ""but if Eric doesn't mind trusting his cause to me, I will defend him, since no other fifth-form fellow stirs.""",pause follow blush crimson get boy say mind trust cause defend other fifth form fellow stir

27,"""All I have got to do,"" said Gibson, rising, ""is to bring before the school the grounds for suspecting Williams, and all the evidence which makes it probable that he is the offender. Now, first of all, the thing must have been done between Friday evening and Saturday morning; and since the school-room door is generally locked soon after school, it was probably done in the short interval between six and a quarter past.

79,"One or two other boys were then called on as witnesses to the great agitation which Eric had shown during the investigation in the school-room, and then Gibson, who was a sensible, self-contained fellow, said, ""I have now done my part. I have shown that the accused had a grudge against Mr. Gordon at the time of the occurrence, and had threatened to be revenged on him; that he was the last boy in the room during the time when the offence must have been committed; that the handwriting is known to resemble his, and that the ink and wafers employed were such as he, and he only, was known to possess. In addition to all this, his behavior, when the matter was first publicly noticed, was exactly such as coincides with the supposition of his guilt. I think you will all agree in considering these grounds of suspicion very strong; and leaving them to carry their full weight with you, I close the case for the prosecution.""",other boy call witness great agitation show investigation school room sensible self contain fellow say do part show accuse have grudge time occurrence threaten revenge last boy room time offence commit handwriting know resemble ink wafer employ such know possess addition behavior matter notice such coincide supposition guilt think agree consider grounds suspicion strong leave carry full weight close case prosecution 
80,"The school listened to Gibson's quiet formality with a kind of grim and gloomy satisfaction, and when he had concluded, there were probably few but Eric's own immediate friends who were not fully convinced of his guilt, however sorry they might be to admit so unfavorable an opinion of a companion whom they all admired.",school listen quiet formality kind grim gloomy satisfaction conclude be few own immediate friend convince guilt sorry admit unfavorable opinion companion admire 
81,"After a minute or two, Russell rose for the defence, and asked, ""Has Williams any objection to his desk being brought, and any of its contents put in as evidence?""",minute rise defence ask objection desk bring content put evidence

83,"The desk was brought, but it was found to be already unlocked, and Russell looked at some of the note-paper which it contained. He then began--""In spite of the evidence adduced, I think I can show that Williams is not guilty. It is quite true that he dislikes Mr. Gordon, and would not object to any open way of showing it; it is quite true that he used the expressions attributed to him, and that the ink and wafers are such as may be found in his desk, and that the handwriting is not unlike his. But is it probable that a boy intending to post up an insult such as this, would do so in a manner, and at a time so likely to involve him in immediate detection, and certain punishment? At any rate, he would surely disguise his usual handwriting. Now, I ask any one to look at this paper, and tell me whether it is not clear, on the contrary, that these letters were traced slowly and with care, as would be the case with an elaborate attempt to imitate?""

87,"""There is another fact which no one yet knows, but which I must mention. It will explain Williams' agitation when Dr. Rowlands read out the words on that paper; and, confident of his innocence, I am indifferent to its appearing to tell against him. I myself once heard Williams use the very words written on that paper, and not only heard them, but expostulated with him strongly for the use of them. I need hardly say how very unlikely it is, that remembering this, he should thus publicly draw my suspicions on him, if he meant to insult Mr. Gordon, undiscovered.

We have had one trial, and now demand another. It is our painful duty to prove Williams' innocence by proving another's guilt. That other is a known enemy of mine, and of Montagu's, and of Owen's.

92,"The real culprit now saw at once that his plot to ruin Eric was recoiling on himself. He got up, swore and blustered at Russell, Duncan, and Williams, and at first flatly refused to allow his desk to be brought. He was, however, forced to yield, and when opened, it was immediately seen that the note-paper it contained was identical with that on which the words had been written. At this he affected to be perfectly unconcerned, and merely protested against what he called the meanness of trying to fix the charge on him.",real culprit see plot ruin recoil get swore bluster refuse allow desk bring force yield open see note paper contain identical word write affect unconcerned protest call meanness try fix charge

I was looking on simply from curiosity, and saw him search Williams' desk, from which he took out something, I could not make out what. He then went to his own place, and wrote for about ten minutes, after which I observed him go up and stand by the notice board.

I was standing by the empty fire-place, when these bits of paper caught my eye. I picked them up, and, after a great deal of trouble, fitted them together.

They then made a double line down each side of the corridor, and turned Barker loose. He stood stock-still at one end, while the fellows nearest him thrashed him unmercifully with the heavy knots. At last the pain was getting severe, and he moved on, finally beginning to run. Five times he was forced up and down the line, and five times did every boy in the line give him a blow, which, if it did not hurt much, at least spoke of no slight anger and contempt. He was dogged and unmoved to the last, and then Avonley hauled him into the presence of Dr. Rowlands. He was put in a secure room by himself, and the next morning was first flogged and then publicly expelled.

He had done more than any other boy to introduce meanness, quarrelling, and vice, and the very atmosphere of the rooms seemed healthier in his absence.
