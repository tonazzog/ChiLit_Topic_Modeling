3,"It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her canvass to the breeze, and sailed for the regions of the south.  Oh, how my heart bounded with delight as I listened to the merry chorus of the sailors, while they hauled at the ropes and got in the anchor!  The captain shouted--the men ran to obey--the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and the shore gradually faded from my view, while I stood looking on with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.",bright beautiful warm day ship spread canvass breeze sail region south heart bound delight listen merry chorus sailor haul rope get anchor captain shout man run obey noble ship bend breeze shore fade view stand look kind feeling whole delightful dream 
4,"The first thing that struck me as being different from anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was the hoisting of the anchor on deck, and lashing it firmly down with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever, and would require its services no more.",first thing strike different see short career sea hoisting anchor deck lash rope bid adieu land require service more 
5,"""There, lass,"" cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after the housing was completed--""there, lass, take a good nap now, for we shan't ask you to kiss the mud again for many a long day to come!""",lass cry broad shoulder jack tar give fluke anchor hearty slap hand housing complete take good nap ask kiss mud many long day come 
6,"And so it was.  That anchor did not ""kiss the mud"" for many long days afterwards; and when at last it did, it was for the last time!",anchor kiss mud many long day last last time 
7,"There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were my special favourites.  Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, broad-shouldered youth of eighteen, with a handsome, good-humoured, firm face.  He had had a good education, was clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild and quiet in disposition.  Jack was a general favourite, and had a peculiar fondness for me.  My other companion was Peterkin Gay.  He was little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, and about fourteen years old.  But Peterkin's mischief was almost always harmless, else he could not have been so much beloved as he was.",be number boy ship special favourite tall strapping broad shoulder youth handsome good humoured firm face have good education clever hearty lion action mild quiet disposition general favourite have peculiar fondness other companion little quick funny mischievous year old mischief harmless else beloved 
8,"""Hallo! youngster,"" cried Jack Martin, giving me a slap on the shoulder, the day I joined the ship, ""come below and I'll show you your berth.  You and I are to be mess-mates, and I think we shall be good friends, for I like the look o' you.""",youngster cry give slap shoulder day join ship come show berth mess mate think good friend like look 
9,Jack was right.  He and I and Peterkin afterwards became the best and stanchest friends that ever tossed together on the stormy waves.,right become good stanchest friend toss stormy wave 
10,"I shall say little about the first part of our voyage.  We had the usual amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw many strange fish rolling in the sea, and I was greatly delighted one day by seeing a shoal of flying fish dart out of the water and skim through the air about a foot above the surface.  They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them, and one flying-fish in its terror flew over the ship, struck on the rigging, and fell upon the deck.  Its wings were just fins elongated, and we found that they could never fly far at a time, and never mounted into the air like birds, but skimmed along the surface of the sea.  Jack and I had it for dinner, and found it remarkably good.",say little first part voyage have usual amount rough weather calm see many strange fish roll sea delight day see shoal fly fish dart water ske air foot surface pursue dolphin feed fly fish terror fly ship strike rigging fall deck wing fin elongate find fly time mount air bird skimm surface sea have dinner find good 
11,"When we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of America, the weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of that terrible cape.",approach southern extremity weather become cold stormy sailor begin tell story furious gale danger terrible cape 
12,"""Cape Horn,"" said one, ""is the most horrible headland I ever doubled. I've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most blow'd out o' the water.""",say horrible headland double sail time ship blow water 
13,"""An' I've been round it once,"" said another, ""an' that time the sails were split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks, so that they wouldn't work, and we wos all but lost.""",say time sail split rope freeze block work lose 
14,"""An' I've been round it five times,"" cried a third, ""an' every time wos wuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!""",time cry third time wo wuss gale tree mendous 
15,"""And I've been round it no times at all,"" cried Peterkin, with an impudent wink of his eye, ""an' _that_ time I wos blow'd inside out!""",time cry impudent wink eye _that_ time blow 
16,"Nevertheless, we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and, in the course of a few weeks afterwards, were sailing gently, before a warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our voyage, sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze, at other times floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the deep,--all of which, although the sailors thought little of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.",pass dread cape much rough weather course few week sail warm tropical breeze proceed voyage bound fair breeze other time float glassy wave fishing curious inhabitant deep sailor think little strange interesting wonderful 
17,"At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific, and I shall never forget the delight with which I gazed,--when we chanced to pass one,--at the pure, white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees, which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we three long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.",last come coral forget delight gaze chance pass pure white dazzling shore verdant palm tree look bright beautiful sunshine long land imagin find perfect happiness wish grant expect 
18,"One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon our ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts; and left only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than enough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days the tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks except one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel, lest he should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The captain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far out of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At day-break on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead.  It was an island encircled by a reef of coral on which the waves broke in fury.  There was calm water within this reef, but we could only see one narrow opening into it.  For this opening we steered, but, ere we reached it, a tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and left us at the mercy of the winds and waves.",night enter tropic awful storm burst ship first squall wind carry mast leave foremast standing more dare hoist rag sail day tempest rage fury sweep deck small boat steersman lash wheel wash give lose captain say have idea blow course fear much get dangerous coral reef numerous day break sixth morning gale see land island encircle reef coral wave break fury be calm water reef see narrow opening opening steer reach tremendous wave break stern tore rudder leave mercy wind wave 
19,"""It's all over with us now, lads,"" said the captain to the men; ""get the boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than half an hour.""",lad say captain man get boat ready launch rock less hour 
20,"The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.",man obey gloomy silence feel be little hope small boat live sea 
21,"""Come boys,"" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we stood on the quarterdeck awaiting our fate;--""Come boys, we three shall stick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can reach the shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean rather to trust myself to a large oar, I see through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into the quiet water inside; so, if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you; will you join me?""",come boy say grave tone stand quarterdeck await fate come boy stick see impossible little boat reach shore crowd man sure upset mean trust large oar see telescope ship strike tail reef wave break quiet water manage cling oar drive breaker gain shore say join 
22,"We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence, although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had little hope; and, indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there was but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered those words, which were among the last that she said to me--""Ralph, my dearest child, always remember in the hour of danger to look to your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to save your body and your soul.""  So I felt much comforted when I thought thereon.",agree follow inspire confidence perceive sad tone voice have little hope look white wave lash reef boil rock fury feel be step death heart sink moment thought turn beloved mother remember word last say dearest child remember hour danger look able willing save body soul feel comfort think 
23,"The ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat, and the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came towards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder.  At the same moment the ship struck, the foremast broke off close to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along with it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an axe to cut it free, but, owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however, washed it clear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next instant we were struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was the boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves. Then I became insensible.",ship rock man ready boat captain give order tremendous wave come run bow lay hold oar reach wave fall deck crash thunder same moment ship strike foremast break deck go side carry boat man oar entangle wreck seize axe cut free ow motion ship miss cordage strike axe oar wave wash clear wreck seize hold next instant struggle wild sea last thing see boat whirl surf sailor toss foaming wave become insensible 
24,"On recovering from my swoon, I found myself lying on a bank of soft grass, under the shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.",recover swoon find lie bank soft grass shelter overhang rock knee side bathing temple water endeavour stop blood flow wound forehead
