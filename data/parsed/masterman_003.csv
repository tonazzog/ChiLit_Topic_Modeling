2,The next morning the _Pacific_ arrived at the Cape and anchored in Table Bay.,next morning arrive anchore 
3,"""Why do they call this Table Bay, Ready?"" said William.",call ready say 
4,"""I suppose it's because they call that great mountain the Table Mountain, Master William; you see how flat the mountain is on the top.""",suppose call great mountain see flat mountain top 
5,"""Yes, it is quite as flat as a table.""",flat table 
6,"""Yes, and sometimes you will see the white clouds rolling down over the top of it in a very curious manner, and that the sailors call spreading the tablecloth: it is a sign of bad weather.""",see white cloud roll top curious manner sailor call spread tablecloth sign bad weather 
7,"""Then I hope they will not spread the tablecloth while we are here, Ready,"" said William, ""for I shall certainly have no appetite.  We have had bad weather enough already, and mamma suffers so much from it.  What a pretty place it is!""",hope spread tablecloth ready say have appetite have bad weather mamma suffer much pretty place 
8,"""We shall remain here two days, sir,"" said Captain Osborn to Mr Seagrave, ""if you and Mrs Seagrave would like to go on shore.""",remain day sir say like go shore 
9,"""I will go down and ask Mrs Seagrave,"" said her husband, who went down the ladder, followed by William.",go ask say husband go ladder follow 
10,"Upon the question being put to Mrs Seagrave, she replied that she was quite satisfied with the ship having no motion, and did not feel herself equal to going on shore; it was therefore decided that she should remain on board with the two younger children, and that, on the following day, Mr Seagrave should take William and Tommy to see Cape Town, and return on board before night.",question put reply satisfied ship have motion feel equal go shore decide remain board young child follow day take see return board night 
11,"The next morning, Captain Osborn lowered down one of the large boats, and Mr Seagrave, accompanied by Captain Osborn, went on shore with William and Tommy.  Tommy had promised his mamma to be very good; but that he always did, and almost always forgot his promise directly he was out of sight.  As soon as they landed, they went up to a gentleman's house, with whom Captain Osborn was acquainted.  They stayed for a few minutes to drink a glass of lemonade, for it was very warm; and then it was proposed that they should go to the Company's Gardens and see the wild beasts which were confined there, at which William was much delighted, and Tommy clapped his hands with joy.",next morning lower large boat accompany go shore promise mamma good forget promise sight land go gentleman house acquainted stay few minute drink glass lemonade warm propose go see wild beast confine delighted clapp hand joy 
12,"""What are the Company's Gardens, papa?"" inquired William.",company garden papa inquire 
13,"""They were made by the Dutch East India Company, at the time that the Cape of Good Hope was in their possession.  They are, properly speaking, Botanical Gardens; but, at the same time, the wild animals are kept there.  Formerly there were a great many, but they have not been paid attention to lately, for we have plenty of these animals in England now.""",make dutch time good possession speak botanical same time wild animal keep be great many pay attention have plenty animal 
14,"""What shall we see?"" said Tommy.",see say 
15,"""You will see lions, Tommy, a great many in a large den together,"" said Captain Osborn.",see lion great many large dan say 
16,"""Oh!  I want to see a lion.""",want see lion 
17,"""You must not go too near them, recollect.""",go recollect 
18,"""No, I won't,"" said Tommy.",say 
19,"As soon as they entered the gates, Tommy escaped from Captain Osborn, and ran away in his hurry to see the lions; but Captain Osborn caught him again, and held him fast by the hand.",enter gate escape run hurry see lion catch hold hand 
20,"""Here is a pair of very strange birds,"" said the gentleman who accompanied them; ""they are called Secretaries, on account of the feathers which hang behind their heads, as the feather of a pen does when a clerk puts it behind his ear: but they are very useful, for they are snake-killers; indeed, they would, if they could, live altogether upon snakes, which they are very great enemies to, never letting one escape.  They strike them with their feet, and with such force as to kill them immediately.""",pair strange bird say gentleman accompany call secretary account feather hang head feather pen do clerk put ear useful snake killer live snake great enemy let escape strike foot such force kill 
21,"""Are there many snakes in this country?"" inquired William.",be many snake country inquire 
22,"""Yes, and very venomous snakes,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""so that these birds are very useful in destroying them.  You observe, William, that the Almighty, in his wisdom, has so arranged it that no animal (especially of a noxious kind) shall be multiplied to excess, but kept under by being preyed upon by some other; indeed, wherever in any country an animal exists in any quantity, there is generally found another animal which destroys it.  The Secretary inhabits this country where snakes exist in numbers, that it may destroy them: in England the bird would be of little value.""",venomous snake reply bird useful destroy observe wisdom arrange animal noxious kind multiply excess keep prey other country animal exist quantity find animal destroy inhabit country snake exist number destroy bird little value 
23,"""But some animals are too large or too fierce to be destroyed by others, papa; for instance, the elephant and the lion.""",animal large fierce destroy other papa instance elephant lion 
24,"""Very true; but these larger animals do not breed so fast, and therefore their numbers do not increase so rapidly.  For instance, a pair of elephants will not have more than one young one in the space of two years or more; while the rabbits, which are preyed upon and the food of so many other beasts as well as birds, would increase enormously, if they were not destroyed.  Examine through the whole of creation, and you will find that there is an unerring hand, which invariably preserves the balance exact; and that there are no more mouths than for which food is provided, although accidental circumstances may for a time occasion a slight alteration.""",true large animal breed number increase instance pair elephant have more young one space year more rabbit prey food many other beast bird increase destroy examine whole creation find be unerr hand preserve balance exact be more mouth food provide accidental circumstance time occasion slight alteration 
25,"They continued their walk until they came to the den of the lions.  It was a large place, in closed with a strong and high wall of stone, with only one window to it for the visitors to look at them, as it was open above.  This window was wide, and with strong iron bars running from the top to the bottom; but the width between the bars was such that a lion could put his paw out with ease; and they were therefore cautioned not to go too near.  It was a fine sight to see eight or ten of these noble-looking animals lying down in various attitudes, quite indifferent apparently to the people outside--basking in the sun, and slowly moving their tufted tails to and fro.  William examined them at a respectful distance from the bars; and so did Tommy, who had his mouth open with astonishment, in which there was at first not a little fear mixed, but he soon got bolder.  The gentleman who had accompanied them, and who had been long at the Cape, was relating to Mr Seagrave and Captain Osborn some very curious anecdotes about the lion.  William and they were so interested, that they did not perceive that Tommy had slipped back to the grated window of the den.  Tommy looked at the lions, and then he wanted to make them move about: there was one fine full-grown young lion, about three years old, who was lying down nearest to the window; and Tommy took up a stone and threw it at him: the lion appeared not to notice it, for he did not move, although he fixed his eyes upon Tommy; so Tommy became more brave, and threw another, and then another, approaching each time nearer to the bars of the window.",continue walk come dan lion large place close strong high wall stone window visitor look open window wide strong iron bar run top bottom width bar such lion put paw ease caution go fine sight see noble look animal lie various attitude indifferent person bask sun move tuft tail for examine respectful distance bar do have mouth open astonishment be first little fear mix get bold gentleman accompany long relate curious anecdote lion interested perceive slip grate window dan look lion want make move be fine full grow young lion year old lie window take stone throw lion appear notice move fix eye become brave throw approach time bar window 
26,"All of a sudden the lion gave a tremendous roar, and sprang at Tommy, bounding against the iron bars of the cage with such force that, had they not been very strong, it must have broken them.  As it was, they shook and rattled so that pieces of mortar fell from the stones.  Tommy shrieked; and, fortunately for himself, fell back and tumbled head over heels, or the lion's paws would have reached him.  Captain Osborn and Mr Seagrave ran up to Tommy, and picked him up: he roared with fright as soon as he could fetch his breath, while the lion stood at the bars, lashing his tail, snarling, and showing his enormous fangs.",lion give tremendous roar spring bound iron bar cage such force strong break shake rattle piece mortar fall stone shriek fall tumble head heel lion paw reach run pick roar fright fetch breath lion stand bar lash tail snarl show enormous fang 
27,"""Take me away--take me on board the ship!"" cried Tommy, who was terribly frightened.",take take board ship cry frighten 
28,"""What did you do, Tommy?"" said Captain Osborn.",do say 
29,"""I won't throw any more stones, Mr Lion; I won't indeed!"" cried Tommy, looking terrified towards the animal.",throw more stone cry look terrified animal 
30,"Mr Seagrave scolded Tommy well for his foolish conduct, and by degrees he became more composed; but he did not recover himself until they had walked some distance away from the lion's den.",scold foolish conduct degree become compose recover walk distance lion dan 
31,"They then looked at the other animals which were to be seen, Tommy keeping a most respectful distance from every one of them.  He wouldn't even go near to a Cape sheep with a broad tail.",look other animal see keep respectful distance one go sheep broad tail 
32,"When they had seen everything, they went back to the gentleman's house to dinner; and, after dinner, they returned on board.",see go gentleman house dinner dinner return board
