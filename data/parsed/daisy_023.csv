Yes, that he did--I remember his very words--that Tomkins could not bring it into court, and so set old Hoxton at us. Well, I told them it would not do--thought I had settled them--saw them off home--yes, Simpson, and Benson, and Grey, up the High Street, and the others their way. I only left Axworthy going into a shop when I set off on my walk. What could a fellow do more? How was I to know that that Axworthy would get them together again, and take them to this affair--pull up the stakes--saw them down--for they were hard to get down--shy all sorts of things over into the court--hoot at old Tomkins’s man, when he told them to be off--and make a bonfire of the sticks at last?”",town fellow last evening come school senior begin put have fence remember very word bring court set old tell do think settle see high other way leave go shop set walk fellow do more know get take affair pull stake see hard get shy sort thing court hoot old man tell make bonfire stick last

Then they desired to know who was there, and that I had not seen; it was all dark, and there had not been a moment, and if I guessed, it was no affair of mine to say. So they ordered me down, and had up Ned Anderson, and one or two more who were known to have been in the riot, and then they consulted a good while, and sent for me; Mr. Wilmot was for me, I am sure, but Harrison was against me. Dr. Hoxton sat there, and made me one of his addresses. He said he would not enter on the question whether I had been present at the repetition of the outrage, as he called it, but what was quite certain was, that I had abused my authority and influence in the school; I had been setting a bad example, and breaking the rules about Ballhatchet, and so far from repressing mischief, I had been the foremost in it, making inflammatory harangues, leading them to commit violence the first time, and the next, if not actually taking part in it personally, at any rate not preventing it. In short, he said it was clear I had not weight enough for my post--it was some excuse I had been raised to it so young--but it was necessary to show that proficiency in studies did not compensate for disregard of discipline, and so he turned me down below the first six!

31,"“It shall not last--it shall not last, my boy,” said Dr. May, pressing Norman’s arm; “I’ll see you righted. Dr. Hoxton shall hear the whole story. I am not for fathers interfering in general, but if ever there was a case, this is!

It is a crying shame.”",last last boy say press arm see right hear whole story father interfere general be case actionable injure whole prospect life take trouble make investigation cry shame 
32,"“Every fellow in the school knows how it was,” said Norman; “and plenty of them would be glad to tell, if they had only the opportunity; but he asked no one but those two or three worst fellows that were at the fire, and they would not tell, on purpose. The school will go to destruction now--they’ll get their way, and all I have been striving for is utterly undone.”",fellow school know say plenty glad tell have opportunity ask bad fellow fire tell purpose school go destruction get way striving undone

It is a mockery, as I have always said, to see that old fellow sit wrapped up in his pomposity, eating his good dinners, and knowing no more what goes on among his boys than this umbrella! But he will listen to me--and we’ll make those boys confess the whole--ay, and have up Ballhatchet himself, to say what your traffic with him was; and we will see what old Hoxton says to you then, Norman.”",set bad example little know do mockery say see old fellow sit wrap pomposity eat good dinner know more go boy umbrella listen make boy confess whole have say traffic see old say 
34,"Dr. May and his son felt keenly and spoke strongly. There was so much of sympathy and fellow-feeling between them, that there was no backwardness on Norman’s part in telling his whole trouble, with more confidence than schoolboys often show towards their fathers, and Dr. May entered into the mortification as if he were still at school. They did not go into the house, but walked long up and down the garden, working themselves up into, if possible, stronger indignation, and concerting the explanation for to-morrow, when Dr. May meant to go at once to the head-master, and make him attend to the true version of the story, appealing to Harvey Anderson himself, Larkins, and many others, for witnesses. There could be hardly a doubt that Norman would be thus exculpated; but, if Dr. Hoxton would not see things in their true light, Dr. May was ready to take him away at once, rather than see him suffer injustice.",son feel speak be much sympathy fellow feeling be backwardness part tell whole trouble more confidence schoolboy show father enter mortification school go house walk garden work possible strong indignation concert explanation mean go head master make attend true version story appeal many other witness be doubt exculpate see thing true light ready take see suffer injustice 
35,"Still, though comforted by his father’s entire reliance, Norman was suffering severely under the sense of indignity, and grieved that Dr. Hoxton and the other masters should have believed him guilty--that name of May could never again boast of being without reproach. To be in disgrace stung him to the quick, even though undeservedly, and he could not bear to go in, meet his sisters, and be pitied. “There’s no need they should know of it,” said he, when the Minster clock pealing ten obliged them to go indoors, and his father agreed. They bade each other good-night, with the renewal of the promise that Dr. Hoxton should be forced to hear Norman’s vindication the first thing to-morrow, Harvey Anderson be disappointed of what he meanly triumphed in, and Norman be again in his post at the head of the school, in more honour and confidence than ever, putting down evil, and making Stoneborough what it ought to be.",comfort father entire reliance suffer sense indignity grieve other master believe guilty name boast reproach disgrace st quick bear go meet sister pity be need know say clock peal oblige go father agree bid other good night renewal promise force hear vindication first thing disappointed triumph post head school more honour confidence put evil make

I came to tell you that our affairs must wait till the afternoon. It is very provoking, for Hoxton may be gone out, but Mr. Lake’s son, at Groveswood, has an attack on the head, and I must go at once. It is a couple of dozen miles off or more.

45,"Before another quarter of an hour had passed, they were driving through the deep lanes, the long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which beaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the influence of the sun’s rays. There was stillness in the air at first, then the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to life, the opening houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of the tumult of feeling, Norman could not but be soothed and refreshed by the new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the school politics, as Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn, the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick-room, and told of the fair sights he had seen at such unwonted hours.",quarter hour pass drive deep lane long grass laden morning dew bead web spider rise cloud mist influence sun ray be stillness air morning sound labourer go world wakening life open house child come school spite tumult feeling sooth refresh new fair morning scene mind quit school politics talk past enjoyment walk drive early dawn delicious sad watch sick room tell fair sight see such unwonted hour 
46,"They had far to go, and the heat of the day had come on before they entered the place of their destination. It was a woodland village, built on a nook in the side of the hill, sloping greenly to the river, and shut in by a white gate, which seemed to gather all in one the little old-fashioned church, its yard, shaded with trees, and enclosed by long white rails; the parsonage, covered with climbing plants and in the midst of a gay garden; and one or two cottages. The woods cast a cool shadow, and, in the meadows by the river rose cocks of new-made hay; there was an air of abiding serenity about the whole place, save that there stood an old man by the gate, evidently watching for the physician’s carriage; and where the sun fell on that parsonage-house was a bedroom window wide open, with the curtains drawn.",have go heat day come enter place destination woodland village build nook side hill slope river shut white gate seem gather little old fashioned church yard shade tree enclose long white rail parsonage cover climb plant midst gay garden cottage wood cast cool shadow meadow river rose cock new make hay be air abide serenity whole place save stand old man gate watch physician carriage sun fall parsonage house bedroom window open curtain draw

48,"Norman knew young Lake, who had been a senior boy when he first went to school, was a Randall scholar, and had borne an excellent character, and highly distinguished himself at the university. And now, by all accounts, he seemed to be dying--in the height of honour and general esteem. Dr. May went into the house, the old man took the horse, and Norman lingered under the trees in the churchyard, watching the white curtains now and then puffed by the fitful summer breeze, as he lay on the turf in the shade, under the influence of the gentle sadness around, resting, mind and body, from the tossing tumultuous passionate sensations that had kept him restless and miserable through the hot night.",know young senior boy go school scholar borne excellent character distinguish university account seem die height honour general esteem go house old man take horse linger tree churchyard watch white curtain puff fitful summer breeze lay turf shade influence gentle sadness rest mind body toss tumultuous passionate sensation keep restless miserable hot night 
49,"He waited long--one hour, two hours had passed away, but he was not impatient, and hardly knew how long the time had been before his father and Mr. Lake came out of the house together, and, after they parted, Dr. May summoned him. He of course asked first for the patient. “Not quite so hopeless as at first,” and the reasons for having been kept so long were detailed, with many circumstances of the youth’s illness, and the parents’ resignation, by which Dr. May was still too deeply touched to have room in his mind for anything besides.",wait hour hour pass impatient know time father come house part summon course ask first patient hopeless first reason keep detailed many circumstance youth illness parent resignation touch have room mind

Of course I should wish Dr. Hoxton to know that I spoke the truth about that walk, and I hope you will let him know, as I appealed to you. But, on cooler thoughts, I don’t believe Dr. Hoxton could seriously suspect me of such a thing as that, and it was not on that ground that I am turned down, but that I did not keep up sufficient discipline, and allowed the outrage, as he calls it. Now, you know, that is, after a fashion, true. If I had not gone on like an ass the other day, and incited them to pull down the fences, they would not have done it afterwards, and perhaps I ought to have kept on guard longer.

I tumbled about all night in a rage, when I thought how they had served me, and of Hoxton’s believing it all, and how he might only half give in to your representation, and then I gloried in Anderson’s coming down from his height, and being seen in his true colours. So it went on till morning came, and I got up. You know you gave me my mother’s little ‘Thomas a Kempis’. I always read a bit every morning.

She would argue vehemently that she could not bear Mr. Wilmot to think ill of him, that it was a great shame of Dr. Hoxton, and that it was dreadful to let such a boy as Harvey Anderson go unpunished. “I really do think it is quite wrong of you to give up your chance of doing good, and leave him in his evil ways!” That was all the comfort she gave Norman, and she walked in to pour out a furious grumbling upon Margaret.",tell own story garden much difficulty indignant exclamation impossible make see father interference put awkward position boy argue bear think ill great shame dreadful let boy go think wrong give chance do good leave evil way comfort give walk pour furious grumbling

98,"“Yes, yes,” said Flora, not by any means wishing to displease her sisters. “If there is such a thing as an excess of generosity, it is sure to be among ourselves. I only know it does not suit me. It will make us all uncomfortable whenever we meet the Andersons or Mr. Wilmot, or any one else, and as to such tenderness to Harvey Anderson, I think it is thrown away.”",say means wish displease sister be thing excess generosity sure know suit make uncomfortable meet one else such tenderness think throw

100,"“To be sure,” broke out Ethel. “Better be than seem! Oh, dear! I am sorry I was vexed with dear old June when he told me. I had rather have him now than if he had gained everything, and every one was praising him--that I had! Harvey Anderson is welcome to be dux and Randall scholar for what I care, while Norman is--while he is, just what we thought of the last time we read that Gospel--you know, Margaret?”",sure break seem dear sorry vex dear old tell have gain one prais have welcome dux scholar care think last time read know

102,"Ethel was entirely consoled. Flora thought of the words “tete exaltee”  and considered herself alone to have sober sense enough to see things in a true light--not that she went the length of believing that Norman had any underhand motives, but she thought it very discreet in her to think a prudent father would not have been satisfied with such a desire to avoid investigation.",console think word consider alone have sober sense see thing true light go length believe have underhand motive think discreet think prudent father satisfy desire avoid investigation 
103,Dr. May would not trust himself to enter on the subject with Dr. Hoxton in conversation; he only wrote a note.,trust enter subject conversation write note

108," A long answer came in return, disclaiming all doubt of Norman’s veracity, and explaining Dr. Hoxton’s grounds for having degraded him. There had been misconduct in the school, he said, for some time past, and he did not consider that it was any very serious reproach, to a boy of Norman’s age, that he had not had weight enough to keep up his authority, and had been carried away by the general feeling. It had been necessary to make an example for the sake of principle, and though very sorry it should have fallen on one of such high promise and general good conduct, Dr. Hoxton trusted that it would not be any permanent injury to his prospects, as his talents had raised him to his former position in the school so much earlier than usual.",long answer come return disclaim doubt veracity explain grounds degrade be misconduct school say time past consider serious reproach boy age have weight keep authority carry general feeling necessary make example sake principle sorry fall such high promise general good conduct trust permanent injury prospect talent raise former position school usual

I’ll stop after church to-morrow and shake hands, and that will show we don’t bear malice.”",fact say old do passion feel punish find be uproar begin sorry answer note stop church shake hand show bear malice 
110,"What Mr. Wilmot might think was felt by all to affect them more nearly. Ethel wanted to hear that he declared his complete conviction of Norman’s innocence, and was disappointed to find that he did not once allude to the subject. She was only consoled by Margaret’s conjecture that, perhaps, he thought the headmaster had been hasty, and could not venture to say so--he saw into people’s characters, and it was notorious that it was just what Dr. Hoxton did not.",think feel affect want hear declare complete conviction innocence disappoint find allude subject console conjecture think headmaster hasty venture say see person character notorious 
111,"Tom had spent the chief of that Saturday in reading a novel borrowed from Axworthy, keeping out of sight of every one. All Sunday he avoided Norman more scrupulously than ever, and again on Monday. That day was a severe trial to Norman; the taking the lower place, and the sense that, excel as much as ever he might in his studies, it would not avail to restore him to his former place, were more unpleasant, when it came to the point, than he had expected.",spend chief read novel borrow keep sight one avoid day severe trial take low place sense excel much study avail restore former place unpleasant come point expect

113,"This was conquered by the strong will and self-rebuke for having merely craved for applause, but, in the play-ground, he found himself still alone--the other boys who had been raised by his fall shrank from intercourse with one whom they had injured by their silence, and the Andersons, who were wont to say the Mays carried every tale home, and who still almost expected interference from Dr. May, hardly believed their victory secure, and the younger one, at least, talked spitefully, and triumphed in the result of May’s meddling and troublesome over strictness. “Such prigs always come to a downfall,” was the sentiment.",conquer strong will self rebuke crave applause play ground find alone other boy raise fall shrank intercourse injure silence wont say carry tale home expect interference believe victory secure young one least talk triumph result meddling troublesome strictness such prig come downfall sentiment 
114,"Norman found himself left out of everything, and stood dispirited and weary on the bank of the river, wishing for Harry, wishing for Cheviot, wishing that he had been able to make a friend who would stand by him, thinking it could not be worse if he had let his father reinstate him--and a sensation of loneliness and injustice hung heavy at his heart.",find leave stand dispirited weary bank river wish wish wish able make friend stand think bad let father reinstate sensation loneliness injustice hang heavy heart 
115,"His first interruption was a merry voice. “I say, June, there’s no end of river cray-fish under that bank,” and Larkins’s droll face was looking up at him, from that favourite position, half stooping, his hands on his knees, his expression of fun trying to conceal his real anxiety and sympathy.",first interruption merry voice say be end river cray fish bank droll face look favourite position half stoop hand knee expression fun try conceal real anxiety sympathy 
116,"Norman turned and smiled, and looked for the cray-fish, and, at the same time, became aware of Hector Ernescliffe, watching for an opportunity to say, “I have a letter from Alan.” He knew they wanted, as far as little boys ventured to seek after one so much their elder, to show themselves his friends, and he was grateful; he roused himself to hear about Alan’s news, and found it was important--his great friend, Captain Gordon, had got a ship, and hoped to be able to take him, and this might lead to Harry’s going with him. Then Norman applied himself to the capture of cray-fish, and Larkins grew so full of fun and drollery, that the hours of recreation passed off less gloomily than they had begun.",turn smile look cray fish same time become aware watch opportunity say have letter know want little boy venture seek elder show friend grateful rouse hear news find important great friend get ship hope able take lead go apply capture cray fish grow full fun drollery hour recreation pass begin 
117,"If only his own brother would have been his adherent! But he saw almost nothing of Tom. Day after day he missed him, he was off before him in going and returning from school, and when he caught a sight of his face, it looked harassed, pale, and miserable, stealing anxious glances after him, yet shrinking from his eye. But, at the same time, Norman did not see him mingling with his former friends, and could not make out how he disposed of himself. To be thus continually shunned by his own brother, even when the general mass were returning to ordinary terms, became so painful, that Norman was always on the watch to seek for one more conversation with him.",own brother adherent see day day miss go return school catch sight face look harass pale miserable steal anxious glance shrink eye same time see mingle former friend make dispose shunn own brother general mass return ordinary term become painful watch seek more conversation

You know I can stand by you still, if you’ll only let me;” and Norman sat by him on the grass, and raised his face by a sort of force, but the kind words only brought more piteous sobs. It was a long time before they diminished enough to let him utter a word, but Norman went on patiently consoling and inquiring, sure, at least, that here had broken down the sullenness that had always repelled him.",matter bullying look tell know stand let sit grass raise face sort force kind word bring piteous sob long time diminish let utter word go consol inquire sure least break sullenness repell

141,"“Then let us come home,” and Tom put his hand into his brother’s, as a few weeks back would have seemed most unworthy of schoolboy dignity.",let come put hand brother few week seem unworthy schoolboy dignity 
142,"Thenceforth Tom was devoted to Norman, and kept close to him, sure that the instant he was from under his wing his former companions would fall on him to revenge his defection, but clinging to him also from real affection and gratitude. Indolence and timidity were the true root of what had for a time seemed like a positively bad disposition; beneath, there was a warm heart, and sense of right, which had been almost stifled for the time, in the desire, from moment to moment, to avoid present trouble or fear. Under Norman’s care his better self had freer scope, he was guarded from immediate terror, and kept from the suggestions of the worse sort of boys, as much as was in his brother’s power; and the looks they cast towards him, and the sly torments they attempted to inflict, by no means invited him back to them. The lessons, where he had a long inveterate habit of shuffling, came under Norman’s eye at the same time. He always prepared them in his presence, instead of in the most secret manner possible, and with all Anderson’s expeditious modes of avoiding the making them of any use. Norman sat by, and gave such help as was fair and just, showed him how to learn, and explained difficulties, and the ingenuity hitherto spent in eluding learning being now directed to gaining it, he began to make real progress and find satisfaction in it. The comfort of being good dawned upon him once more, but still there was much to contend with; he had acquired such a habit of prevarication that, if by any means taken by surprise, his impulse was to avoid giving a straightforward answer, and when he recollected his sincerity, the truth came with the air of falsehood. Moreover, he was an arrant coward, and provoked tricks by his manifest and unreasonable terrors. It was no slight exercise of patience that Norman underwent, but this was the interest he had made for himself; and the recovery of the boy’s attachment, and his improvement, though slow, were a present recompense.",devote keep sure instant wing former companion fall revenge defection cling real affection gratitude indolence timidity true root have time seem bad disposition be warm heart sense right stifle time desire moment moment avoid present trouble fear care good self have freer scope guard immediate terror keep suggestion bad sort boy brother power look cast sly torment attempt inflict means invite lesson have long inveterate habit shuffle come eye same time prepare presence secret manner possible expeditious mode avoid make use sit give such help fair show learn explain difficulty ingenuity spend elude learning direct gain begin make real progress find satisfaction comfort good dawn be much contend acquire habit prevarication means take surprise impulse avoid give straightforward answer recollect sincerity truth come air falsehood arrant coward provoke trick manifest unreasonable terror slight exercise patience underwent interest make recovery boy attachment improvement slow present recompense 
143,"Ernescliffe, Larkins, and others of the boys, held fast to him, and after the first excitement was past, all the rest returned to their former tone. He was decidedly as much respected as ever, and, at the same time, regarded with more favour than when his strictness was resented. And as for the discipline of the school, that did not suffer. Anderson felt that, for his own credit, he must not allow the rules to be less observed than in May’s reign, and he enforced them upon the reluctant and angry boys with whom he had been previously making common cause. Dr. Hoxton boasted to the under-masters that the school had never been in such good order as under Anderson, little guessing that this was but reaping the fruits of a past victory, or that every boy in the whole school gave the highest place in their esteem to the deposed dux.",other boy hold first excitement past rest return former tone respect same time regard more favour strictness resent discipline school suffer feel own credit allow rule observe reign enforce reluctant angry boy make common cause boast under master school such good order little guess reap fruit past victory boy whole school give high place esteem depose dux 
144,"To Anderson, Norman’s cordial manner and ready support were the strangest part of all, only explained by thinking that he deemed it, as he tried to do himself, merely the fortune of war, and was sensible of no injury.",cordial manner ready support strangest part explain think deem try do fortune war sensible injury 
145,"And, for Norman himself, when the first shock was over, and he was accustomed to the change, he found the cessation of vigilance a relief, and carried a lighter heart than any time since his mother’s death. His sisters could not help observing that there was less sadness in the expression of his eyes, that he carried his head higher, walked with freedom and elasticity of step, tossed and flourished the Daisy till she shouted and crowed, while Margaret shrank at such freaks; and, though he was not much of a laugher himself, contributed much sport in the way of bright apposite sayings to the home circle.",first shock accustom change find cessation vigilance relief carry light heart time mother death sister help observe be less sadness expression eye carry head high walk freedom elasticity step toss flourish shout crow shrank such freak much laugher contribute much sport way bright apposite saying home circle 
146,"It was a very unexpected mode of cure for depression of spirits, but there could be no question that it succeeded; and when, a few Saturdays after, he drove Dr. May again to Groveswood to see young Mr. Lake, who was recovering, he brought Margaret home a whole pile of botanical curiosities, and drew his father into an animated battle over natural and Linnaean systems, which kept the whole party merry with the pros and cons every evening for a week.",unexpected mode cure depression spirit be question succeed few saturday drive see young recover bring whole pile botanical curiosity draw father animated battle natural linnaean system keep whole party merry pro con evening week
