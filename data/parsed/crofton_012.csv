1,CHAPTER 12. HOLT AND HIS DIGNITY.,dignity 
2,"There was no reason now why Hugh should not go to church.  He and his crutches went between his uncle and aunt in the gig one way, and between his uncle and Agnes home again; and he could walk up the aisle quite well.  He had been pleased at the idea of attending church again, and had never thought of the pain of being stared at for his lameness.  This pain came upon him as he entered the church; and as he went up towards his uncle's pew, and saw the crowd of Crofton boys all looking at him, and some of the poor people turning their heads as he passed, to observe how he got on, he felt covered with confusion, and wished that he had waited one more Sunday, when the Crofton boys would have been all gone, and there would have been fewer eyes to mark his infirmity.  But better thoughts soon arose, and made him ashamed of his false shame; and before the service was over, he felt how trifling is any misfortune while we are friends with God, in comparison with the least wrong-doing which sets us at a distance from him.  He could not but feel after church that he had rather, a thousand times, be as he was than be poor Lamb, who slunk away from him, and hid himself behind the other boys,--his mind sore and troubled, no doubt, about his debt, and his cheating transaction, so long ago.  Hugh asked some of the boys to bring up Lamb, to shake hands before parting for the holidays; but he would not come, and wriggled himself out of sight.  Then Hugh recollected that he could forgive Lamb as well without Lamb's knowing it; and he let him alone.",be reason go church crutch go uncle aunt gig way uncle walk aisle pleased idea attend church think pain stare lameness pain come enter church go uncle pew see crowd boy look poor person turn head pass observe get feel cover confusion wish wait more boy gone be few eye mark infirmity good thought arise make ashamed false shame service feel trifling misfortune friend comparison least wrong do set distance feel church have time poor slunk hide other boy mind sore trouble doubt debt cheating transaction ask boy bring shake hand part holiday come wriggle sight recollect forgive know let 
3,"Then there was Holt.  He and Holt had parted on uneasy terms; and Holt now looked shy and uncomfortable.  Hugh beckoned to him, and asked him whether he was really to remain at Crofton all the holidays.",be part uneasy term look shy uncomfortable beckon ask remain holiday 
4,"""Yes,"" said Holt.  ""I am the only one not going home, unless you are to stay hereabouts.  Even Tooke is to be at his uncle's in London.  When do you go home?""",say only one go stay hereabouts uncle go 
5,"""Not quite yet;--not at the beginning of the holidays,"" said Hugh, hesitating, and looking up at his uncle.  For, in truth, he did not know exactly what was planned for him, and had been afraid to ask.",beginning holiday say hesitate look uncle truth know plan afraid ask 
6,"His uncle said, very kindly, that he was not going to part with Hugh till school opened again.  He would recover his full strength better in the country; and his aunt had promised his parents that he should be a stout boy again by the time he was wanted at Crofton.",uncle say go part school open recover full strength country aunt promise parent stout boy time want 
7,"This was what Hugh had dreaded to hear; and when he thought that he should not see his parents, nor little Harry, for so many months, his heart sank.  But he was still in the church; and perhaps the place helped him to remember his mother's expectation that he should not fail, and his own resolution to bear cheerfully whatever troubles his misfortune brought upon him, from the greatest to the least.  So when he heard his uncle saying to Holt that he should ask Mr Tooke to let him come and spend two or three weeks at his house, he said so heartily that he hoped Holt would come, that Holt felt that whatever discontent had been between them was forgiven and forgotten.",dread hear think see parent little many month heart sink church place help remember mother expectation fail own resolution bear trouble misfortune bring great least hear uncle say ask let come spend week house say hope come feel discontent forgive forget 
8,"Phil went home, of course; and when Holt arrived at Mr Shaw's, Agnes also returned to London, that she might see something of Phil.  Then the two boys were glad to be together, though Hugh would rather have had his dear friend Dale for a companion; and Holt knew that this was the case. Yet Hugh saw, and was glad to see, that Holt was improved.  He had plucked up some spirit, and was more like other lads, though still, by his own account, too much like a timid, helpless foreigner among the rough Crofton boys.",go course arrive return see boy glad have dear friend companion know case see glad see improve pluck spirit other lad own account timid helpless foreigner rough boy 
9,"All the boys had some lessons to prepare in the holidays.  Every one who had ever written a theme had a theme to write now.  Every boy who could construe had a good piece of Latin to prepare; and all had either Latin or English verses to learn by heart.  Mrs Shaw made a point of her young visitors sitting down every morning after breakfast to their business; and Hugh was anxious to spare no pains, this time, about his theme, that, if he was to be praised, he might deserve it.  He saw that Holt could not fix his attention well, either upon work or play; and one morning, when Hugh was pondering how, without knowing anything of history, he should find a modern example to match well with his ancient one (which he had picked up by chance), Holt burst upon his meditation with--",boy have lesson prepare holiday one write theme have theme write boy construe have good piece prepare have latin english verse learn heart make point young visitor sit morning breakfast business anxious spare pain time theme praise deserve see fix attention work play morning ponder know history find modern example match ancient one pick chance burst meditation

11,"""Wait a minute,"" said Hugh.  ""I must find my example first.""",wait minute say find example 
12,"No example could he find, to his satisfaction, this day.  He gave it up till to-morrow, and then asked Holt what was on his mind.  But Holt now drew back, and did not think he could tell.  This made Hugh press; and Hugh's pressing looked like sympathy, and gave Holt courage: so that the thing came out at last.  Holt was very miserable, for he was deep in debt, and the boys never let him alone about it; and he did not see how he should ever pay, as nobody was likely to give him any money.",example find satisfaction day give ask mind draw think tell make press press look sympathy give courage thing come last miserable deep debt boy let see pay likely give money 
13,"""Remember, it is only sixpence that you owe me--not a shilling,"" said Hugh.",remember owe shilling say 
14,"Holt sighed.  Perhaps he had hoped that Hugh would excuse him altogether.  He explained that this sixpence was not all, nor the chief part.  He told that, when the whole school was on the heath, one Saturday, they had seen a balloon rising at a distance, and some boys began betting about what direction it would move in when it ceased to rise perpendicularly.  The betting spread till the boys told him he must bet, or he would be the only one left out, and would look like a shabby fellow.",sigh hope excuse explain sixpence chief part tell whole school heath see balloon rise distance boy begin bet direction move cease rise betting spread boy tell bet only one leave look shabby fellow

23,"""As if it was about the money!"" cried Hugh.  ""I should not have cared a bit if my uncle had asked me for it back again the next day.  It was the being cheated.  That was the thing.  What a shame--""",money cry care bit uncle ask next day cheat thing shame 
24,"""By-the-by, did your uncle ever ask what you did with that half-crown?""",uncle ask do half crown 
25,"""No; but he will next week, at the January fair.  He will be sure to ask then.  What a shame of the boys to say so, when I forgave--""",next week fair sure ask shame boy say forgive 
26,"He remembered, just in time, that he had better not boast, or speak aloud, of having forgiven Lamb his debt in secret.  He resolved that he would not say another word, but let the boys see that he did not care for money for its own sake.  They were all wrong, but he would be above noticing it; and, besides, he really had been very anxious about his half-crown, and they had only mistaken the reason.",remember time boast speak forgive debt secret resolve say word let boy see care money own sake wrong notice anxious half crown mistaken reason 
27,"""How much did you bet on the balloon?"" he inquired of Holt.",bet balloon inquire 
28,"""A shilling; and I lost.""",shilling lose

30,"""But that is not all.  I borrowed a shilling of Meredith to pay school-fines--""",borrow shilling pay school fine 
31,"""What for?""",
32,"""Chiefly for leaving my books about.  Meredith says I promised to pay him before the holidays; but I am sure I never did.  He twitted me about it, so that I declare I would have fought him, if I could have paid him first.""",leave book say promise pay holiday sure twite declare fight pay 
33,"""That's right,"" exclaimed Hugh.  ""Why, Holt, what a different fellow you are!  You never used to talk of fighting.""",right exclaim different fellow use talk fighting

36,"""No; you know I can't.  You know he complains about having to pay the bills for me before my father can send the money from India.""",know know complain have pay bill father send money 
37,"""I suppose it would take too long to ask your father.  Yes; of course it would.  There would be another holidays before you could have an answer; and almost another still.

40,"""Mr Tooke?  Oh!  I dare not.""",

44,"""I wish I dare!""",wish dare 
45,"Holt was not long in passing from wishing to daring.  He wrote a letter, which Hugh thought would do, though he rather wished Holt had not mentioned him as instigating the act.  This was the letter:",long passing wish dare write letter think do wish mention instigate act letter

Then I owe a boy a   shilling, lent me for school-fines; and he never lets me alone about   it.  Then I was led into betting a shilling on a balloon, and I lost;   and so I owe half-a-crown.

51,"Mr Shaw's man George carried the letter; but he brought back neither letter nor money: only a message that Mr Tooke would call; which put Holt into a great fright, and made Hugh rather uneasy.",man carry letter bring letter money message call put great fright make uneasy 
52,"There was no occasion for this, however.  Mr Tooke came alone into the room where the boys were sitting; and neither Mr nor Mrs Shaw appeared during the whole time of his visit: a thing which was rather odd, but which the boys were very glad of.  When Mr Tooke had told them a little of some new boys expected after the holidays, he said:",be occasion come room boy sit appear whole time visit thing odd boy glad tell little new boy expect holiday say 
53,"""Well, now, Holt, let us see what can be done about your affairs.""",let see do affair 
54,"Holt looked uneasy; for it seemed as if Mr Tooke was not going to lend him the money,--or to give it, which was what he had hoped, while using the word ""lend.""",look uneasy seem go lend money give hope use word lend 
55,"""I am glad you asked me,"" continued Mr Tooke; ""for people, whether they be men or boys, can usually retrieve their affairs when they have resolution to face their difficulties.

We must consider how you are to get out of it.""",glad ask continue person man boy retrieve affair have resolution face difficulty be occasion say get debt consider get

58,Holt sighed.  Mr Tooke went on.,sigh go

60,"""No, sir, certainly,"" said both the boys.",sir say boy 
61,"""What do people do, all the world over, when they want money?"" asked Mr Tooke.  Holt looked puzzled.  Hugh smiled.  Holt was hesitating whether to guess that they put into the lottery, or dig for treasure, or borrow from their friends, or what.  Having always till lately lived in India, where Europeans are rather lazy, and life altogether is very languid, he did not see, as Hugh did, what Mr Tooke could mean.",person do world want money ask look puzzled smile hesitate guess put lottery dig treasure borrow friend till live lazy life languid see mean

64,"""Why, Holt, you must know very well.  We ask them whether they cannot get work.""",know ask get work 
65,"""Work!"" cried Holt.",work cry 
66,"""Yes,"" said Mr Tooke.  ""The fathers and uncles of both of you work for what money they have; and so do I; and so does every man among our neighbours who is satisfied with his condition.

71,"""Widow Murray thinks she should have a better chance for a new lodger if her little parlour was fresh papered; but she is too rheumatic to do it herself, and cannot afford to engage a workman.

But the copies must be quite correct, and the writing good.  I can offer you one other choice.  Our school library wants looking to.

74,Holt's pleasure in the prospect of being out of debt was swallowed up in the anxiety of undertaking anything so new to him as work out of school. Hugh hurried him on to a decision.,pleasure prospect debt swallow anxiety undertake new work school hurry decision 
75,"""Do choose the papering,"" urged Hugh.  ""I can help you in that, I do believe.  I can walk that little way, to widow Murray's; and I can paste the paper.  Widow Murray will show you how to do it; and it is very easy, if you once learn to join the pattern.

I don't mean that I would not help you, but it would be the dullest work of all.""",dull work exclaim think copy same rule time make mistake write half crown mean help dullest work 
82,"Mr Tooke sat patiently waiting till Holt had made up his mind.  He perceived something that never entered Hugh's mind: that Holt's pride was hurt at the notion of doing workman's work.  He wrote on a slip of paper these few words, and pushed them across the table to Holt, with a smile:--",sit wait make mind perceive enter mind pride hurt notion do work write slip paper few word push table smile

84,"Holt coloured as he read, and immediately said that he chose the papering job.  Mr Tooke rose, tossed the slip of paper into the fire, buttoned up his coat, and said that he should let widow Murray know that a workman would wait upon her the next morning, and that she must have her paste and brushes and scissors ready.",coloured read say choose papering job rise toss slip paper fire button coat say let widow know workman wait next morning have paste brush scissors ready

89,Here again Holt's pride was hurt; but the thought of being out of Meredith's power sustained him.,pride hurt thought power sustain 
90,"When Mr Tooke was gone, Hugh said to his companion,--",gone say companion

93,"""O!  Very well!"" replied Hugh, not sure whether he was pleased or not.",reply sure pleased 
94,"The next morning was so fine that there was no difficulty about Hugh's walking the short distance to the widow Murray's; and there, for three mornings, did the boys work diligently, till the room was papered, and two cupboards into the bargain.  Holt liked it very well, except for two things:--that Hugh was sure he could have done some difficult corners better than Holt had done them, if he could but have stood upon the steps; and that widow Murray did so persist in thanking him, that he had to tell her several times over that she was not obliged to him at all, because he was to be paid for the job.",next morning fine be difficulty walk short distance widow morning boy work room paper cupboard bargain like thing sure do difficult corner good do stand step widow persist thank have tell several time oblige pay job 
95,"Mr Tooke came to see the work when it was done, and returned to Mr Shaw's with the boys, in order to pay Holt his half-crown immediately, and yet so that the widow should not see.  Hugh's eye followed Mr Tooke's hand as it went a second time into his pocket; and he was conscious of some sort of hope that he might be paid something too. When no more silver came forth, he felt aware that he ought not to have dreamed of any reward for the help he had freely offered to his companion: and he asked himself whether his schoolfellows were altogether wrong in thinking him too fond of money; and whether he was altogether right in having said that it was justice that he cared for, and not money, when he had pressed his debtor hard.  However this might be, he was very glad to receive his sixpence from Holt.  As he put it in his inner pocket, he observed that this would be all the money he should have in the world when he should have spent his five shillings in fairings for home.",come see work do return boy order pay half crown widow see eye follow hand go second time pocket conscious sort hope pay more silver come feel aware dream reward help offer companion ask schoolfellow wrong think fond money right say justice care money press debtor glad receive sixpence put inner pocket observe money world spend shilling fairing home 
96,"Holt made no answer.  He had nothing to spend in the fair; still less, anything left over.  But he remembered that he was out of debt,--that Meredith, would twit him no more,--and he began to whistle, so light-hearted, that no amount of money could have made him happier.  He only left off whistling to thank Hugh earnestly for having persuaded him to open his heart to Mr Tooke.",make answer have spend fair less leave remember debt twit more begin whistle light hearted amount money make happy leave whistle thank persuade open heart
