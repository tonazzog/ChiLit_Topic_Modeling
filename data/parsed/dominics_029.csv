1,CHAPTER 28. MR CRIPPS AT SAINT DOMINIC'S.,
2,"Oliver Greenfield's banishment from civilised society, however much it may have gratified the virtuous young gentlemen of the Fifth, was regarded by a small section of fellows in the Sixth with unmitigated disgust.  These fellows were the leading spirits of the Saint Dominic Football Club, which was just about to open proceedings for the season. To them the loss of the best half-back in the school was a desperate calamity.",banishment civilised society much gratified virtuous young gentleman fifth regard small section fellow sixth unmitigated disgust fellow lead spirit about open proceedings season loss good half school desperate calamity 
3,"They raged and raved over the matter with all the fury of disappointed enthusiasts.  _They_ didn't care a bit, it almost seemed, whether the fellow was a cheat or not.  All they knew was, he was the quickest half-back and the safest drop-kick the school had, and here was the match with Landfield coming on, and, lo and behold! their man was in Coventry, forsooth, and not to be had out for love or money.  Thus baulked, the Sixth Form athletes could afford to wax very virtuous and philanthropic on the subject of Coventry generally.",rage rave matter fury disappoint enthusiast care bit seem fellow cheat know quick half back safe drop kick school have match come behold man forsooth have love money baulk sixth form athlete afford wax virtuous philanthropic subject

27,"A powerful deputation waited on Wraysford that same evening to try to prevail upon him to play in the fifteen.  They had hard work to do it.

34,"That very day he had received a most unexpected present in the shape of a five-pound note from an aunt, which sum he had promptly and virtuously put into an envelope and sent down to Mr Cripps in further liquidation of his ""little bill.""  Was ever such luck?  And next week the usual remittance from home would be due; there would be another three or four pounds paid off.  Loman felt quite touched at the thought of his own honesty and solvency.  If only everybody in the world paid their debts as he did, what a happy state of things it would be for the country!",very day receive unexpected present shape pound note aunt sum have put envelope send further liquidation little bill such luck next week usual remittance home due be pound pay feel touch thought own honesty solvency world pay debt happy state thing country 
35,"So, as I said, Loman looked forward to the football match in quite good spirits, just as a man who has been working hard and anxiously for eleven long months looks forward to his well-earned summer holiday. Things were looking up with him, and no mistake.",say look football match good spirit man work long month look earn summer holiday thing look mistake 
36,"And then, just like his luck, the Doctor had that same day made the announcement, already referred to, of another scholarship to be competed for directly after Christmas.  It was for Sixth form boys under seventeen, and he meant to go in for it!  True, this scholarship was only for twenty pounds for a single year, but that was something.  As far as he could see, Wraysford, who would get his move up at Christmas, would be the only man in against him, if he did go in, and he fancied he could beat Wraysford.  For in the Nightingale exam he had not really tried his best, but this time he would and astonish everybody. Greenfield would scarcely go in for this exam, even if he got his move up; it was safe to conclude his recent exploit would suffice him in the way of exams, for some time to come.",luck have same day make announcement refer scholarship compet sixth form boy mean go true scholarship pound single year see get move only man go fancy beat exam try good time astonish go exam get move safe conclude recent exploit suffice way exam time come 
37,"And then, what could be more opportune than its coming off just after Christmas, at the precise time when Cripps would be looking for a final settlement of his account, or whatever little of it remained still to pay!

Why, Loman was positively being bathed in luck at the present time!",opportune come precise time look final settlement account little remain pay dear dear thing straight honest prosper man go honest bath luck present time 
38,"The Saturday came at last.  Stansfield had drilled his men as well as he could during the interval, and devoutly hoped that he had got a respectable team to cope with the Landfield fellows.  If he could only have been sure of his half-back he would have been quite happy; and never a practice passed without his growling louder than ever at the disgraceful custom of sending useful behind-scrimmage men to Coventry. At the last moment he decided to give the responsible post to Loman, rather than move forward Wraysford from his position at ""back""; and Loman's usual place at quarter-back was filled up by young Forrester of the Fourth, greatly to that young gentleman's trepidation and to the exultation of the Fourth Senior as a body, who felt terrifically puffed up to have one of their men actually in the first fifteen.",come last drill man interval hope get respectable team cope fellow sure half happy practice pass growling louder disgraceful custom send useful scrimmage man last moment decide give responsible post move position back usual place quarter back fill young fourth young gentleman trepidation exultation fourth body feel puff have man first 
39,"Some of my readers may perhaps know from actual experience what are the numerous and serious anxieties which always beset the captain of the football fifteen.  If the fellow is worth his salt he knows to a nicety where he is strong and where he is weak; he knows, if the wind blows one way, which is the best quarter-back to put on the left and which on the right.  He knows which of his ""bulldogs"" he can safely put into the middle of the scrimmage, and which are most useful in the second tier. He knows when to call ""Kick!"" to a man and when to call ""Run!"" and no man knows better when to throw the ball far out from touch, or when to nurse it along close to the line.  It is all very well for outsiders to talk of football everlastingly as a _game_.  My dear, good people, football is a science if ever there was a science; the more you know of it the more you will find that out.",reader know actual experience numerous serious anxiety beset captain football fellow worth salt know nicety strong weak know wind blow way good quarter back put left right know bulldog put middle scrimmage useful second tier know call kick man call run man know good throw ball touch nurse line outsider talk football _game_ dear good person football science be science more know more find 
40,"This piece of lecturing is thrown in here for the purpose of observing that Stansfield was a model football captain.  However worried and worrying and crabby he was in his ordinary clothes, in his football togs and on the field of battle he was the coolest, quickest, readiest, and cunningest general you could desire.  He said no more than he could help, and never scolded his men while play was going on, and, best of all, worked like a horse himself in the thick of the fight, and looked to every one else to do the same.",piece lecturing throw purpose observe model football captain worried worry crabby ordinary clothes football tog field battle coolest quick readiest cunningest general desire say more help scold man play go good work horse thick fight look one else do same 
41,Yet on this Saturday all the captain's prowess and generalship could not win the match for Saint Dominic's against Landfield.,captain prowess generalship win match 
42,"The match began evenly, and for the first half of the time the game was one long succession of scrimmages in the middle of the ground, from which the ball hardly ever escaped, and when it did, escaped only to be driven back next moment into the ""mush.""",match begin first half time game long succession scrimmage middle ground ball escape escape drive next moment mush 
43,"""It'll do at this rate!"" thinks Stansfield to himself.  ""As long as they keep it among the forwards we shan't hurt.""",do rate think keep forward hurt 
44,"Alas! one might almost have declared some tell-tale evil spirit had heard the boast and carried it to the ear of the enemy, for next moment half-time was called, the sides changed over, and with them the Landfielders completely reversed their tactics.",declare tell tale evil spirit hear boast carry ear enemy next moment half time call side change reverse tactic 
45,"The game was no longer locked up in a scrimmage in the middle of the ground.  It became looser all along the line; the ball began to slip through the struggling feet into the hands of those behind, who sent it shooting over the heads of the forwards into more open ground.  The quarter-backs and half-backs on either side ran and got round the scrimmages; and when at last they were collared, took to ending up with an expiring drop-kick, which sent the ball far in the direction of the coveted goals.",game lock scrimmage middle ground become loser line ball begin slip struggle foot hand send shoot head forward open ground quarter back half back side run get scrimmage last collare take end expire drop kick send ball direction covete goal 
46,"Nothing could have happened worse for Saint Dominic's, for the strain fell upon them just at their weakest point.  Stansfield groaned as he saw chance after chance missed behind his scrimmages.  Young Forrester played pluckily and hard at quarter-back, and shirked nothing; but he could not kick, and his short runs were consequently of little use. Callonby, of course, did good work, but Loman, the half-back, was woefully unsteady.",happen bad strain fall weak point groan see chance chance miss scrimmage young play quarter back shirk kick short run little use course do good work half back unsteady 
47,"""What a jackass I was to put the fellow there!"" said Stansfield to himself.",jackass put fellow say

49,"There goes the ball again, clean over the forwards' heads, straight for him!  He is going to catch it and run!  No; he is not!  He is going to take a flying kick!  No, he is not; he is going to make his mark!  No, he is not; he is going to dribble it through!  Now if there is one thing fatal to football it is indecision.  If you wobble about, so to speak, between half a dozen opinions, you may just as well sit down on the ground where you are and let the ball go to Jericho.  Loman gets flurried completely, and ends by giving the ball a miserable side-kick into touch--to the extreme horror of everybody and the unmitigated disgust of the peppery Stansfield.",go ball clean forward head straight go catch run go take fly kick go make mark go dribble be thing fatal football indecision wobble speak opinion sit ground let ball go flurry end give ball miserable side kick touch extreme horror unmitigated disgust peppery 
50,"Yet had the captain and his men known the cause of all this--had they been aware that that flash, half-tipsy cad of a fellow who, with half a dozen of his ""pals,"" was watching the match with a critical air, there at the ropes was the landlord of the Cockchafer himself, the holder of Loman's ""little bill"" for 30 pounds, they would perhaps have understood and forgiven their comrade's clumsiness.  But they did not.",have captain man know cause aware flash half tipsy cad fellow pal watch match critical air rope landlord holder little bill pound understand forgive comrade clumsiness 
51,"Whatever had brought Cripps there?  A thousand possibilities flashed through Loman's mind as he caught sight of his unwelcome acquaintance in the middle of the match.  Was he come to make a row about his money before all the school? or had anything fresh turned up, or what?  And why on earth did he bring those other cads with him, all of whom Loman recognised as pot-house celebrities of his own acquaintance?

52,"He felt miserable every time the ball flew over to Cripps's side of the ground.

But this delusion was soon dispelled.",feel miserable time ball fly side ground be possibility landlord come curiosity recognise young friend player delusion dispell

61,"The Landfield men were quick enough to see the weak point of their enemies, and make use of the discovery.  They played fast and loose, giving the ball not a moment's peace, and above all avoiding scrimmages. The Saint Dominic's forwards were thus made practically useless, and the brunt of the encounter fell on the four or five players behind, and they were not equal to it.",man quick see weak point enemy make use discovery play fast give ball moment peace avoid scrimmage forward make useless brunt encounter fall player equal 
62,"The calamity comes at last.  One of the Landfield men gets hold of the ball, and runs down hard along the touch-line.

63,"Stansfield, anticipating this, is ready himself at half-back, and it will go hard with him indeed if he does not collar his man.  Alas! just as the Landfielder comes to close quarters, and the Saint Dominic's captain grips him round the waist, the ball flies neatly back into the hands of another of the enemy, who, amid the shouts of his own men and the crowd, makes off with it like fury, with a clear field before him, and only Wraysford between him and the Dominican goal.",anticipate ready half go collar man come close quarter captain grip waist ball fly hand enemy shout own man crowd make fury clear field dominican goal

66,"But if he had the eyes of an Argus, and the legs of an Atlas, he could not prevent that goal.  For the Landfield man has no notion of coming to close quarters; he is their crack drop-kick, and would be an ass indeed if he did not employ his talent with such a chance as this.  He only runs a short way.  Then he slackens pace.  Wraysford rushes forward in front, the pursuing host rush on behind, but every one sees how it will be.  The fellow takes a deliberate drop-kick at the goal, and up flies the ball as true as a rocket, clean over the posts, as certain a goal as Saint Dominic's ever lost!  It was no use crying over spilt milk, and for the rest of the game Stansfield relaxed no efforts to stay the tide of defeat.  And he succeeded too, for though the ball remained dangerously near the school goal, and once or twice slipped behind, the enemy were unable to make any addition to their score before ""Time"" was called.",have eye leg prevent goal man have notion come close quarter crack drop kick ass employ talent chance run short way slacken pace rush front pursue host rush one see fellow take deliberate drop kick goal fly ball true rocket clean post certain goal lose use cry spilt milk rest game relax effort stay tide defeat succeed ball remain school goal slip enemy unable make addition score time call

Only mind you come and give us a look up soon, young gentleman, for I and my pals ain't seen you for a good while now, and was afraid something was up.  Ta! ta! Good-day, young gentlemen all.
