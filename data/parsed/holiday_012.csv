3," The following Saturday morning, Frank, Harry, and Laura were assembled before Lady Harriet's breakfast hour, talking over all their adventures on the night of the illumination; and many a merry laugh was heard while uncle David cracked his jokes and told his stories, for he seemed as full of fun and spirits as the youngest boy in a play-ground.",follow morning assemble breakfast hour talk adventure night illumination many merry laugh hear uncle crack joke tell story seem full fun spirit young boy play ground 
4,"""Well, old fellow!"" said he, lifting up Harry, and suddenly seating him on the high marble chimney-piece. ""That is the situation where the poor little dwarf, Baron Borowloski was always put by his tall wife, when she wished to keep him out of mischief, and I wonder Mrs. Crabtree never thought of the same plan for you.""",old fellow say lift seating high marble chimney piece situation poor little dwarf put tall wife wish keep mischief wonder think same plan 
5,"""Luckily there is no fire, or Harry would soon be roasted for the Giant Snap-'em-up's dinner,"" said Frank, laughing; ""he looks up there like a China Mandarin. Shake your head, Harry, and you will do quite as well!""",be fire roast dinner say laugh look shake head do 
6,"""Uncle David!"" cried Harry, eagerly, ""pray let me see you stand for one moment as you do at the club on a cold day, with your feet upon the rug, your back to the fire, and your coat-tails under your arms! Pray do, for one minute!""",uncle cry pray let see stand moment do club cold day foot rug back fire coat tail arm pray do minute 
7,"Uncle David did as he was asked, evidently expecting the result, which took place, for Harry sprung upon his back with the agility of a monkey, and they went round and round the room at a full gallop, during the next five minutes, while Lady Harriet said she never saw two such noisy people, but it was quite the fashion now, since the king of France carried his grandchildren, in the same way, every morning, a picture of which had lately been shown to her.",ask expect result take place spring back agility monkey go room full gallop next minute say see such noisy person fashion king carry grandchild same way morning picture show 
8,"""Then I hope his majesty gets as good an appetite with his romp as I have done,"" replied Major Graham, sitting down. ""None of your tea and toast for me! that is only fit for ladies. Frank, reach me these beef-steaks, and a cup of chocolate.""",hope majesty get good appetite romp do reply sit tea toast fit lady reach beef steak cup chocolate 
9,"Harry and Laura now planted themselves at the window, gazing at crowds of people who passed, while, by way of a joke, they guessed what everybody had come out for, and who they all were.",plant window gaze crowd person pass way joke guess come 
10,"""There is a fat cook with a basket under her arm, going to market,"" said Harry. ""Did you ever observe when Mrs. Marmalade comes home, she says to grandmama, 'I have desired a leg of mutton to come here, my lady! and I told a goose to be over also,' as if the leg of mutton and the goose walked here, arm-in-arm, of themselves.""",be fat cook basket arm go market say observe come say grandmama desire leg mutton come lady tell goose leg mutton goose walk arm arm 
11,"""Look at those children, going to see the wild beasts,"" added Laura, ""and this little girl is on her way to buy a new frock. I am sure she needs one! that old man is hurrying along because he is too late for the mail-coach; and this lady with a gown like a yellow daffodil, is going to take root in the Botanical Gardens!""",look child go see wild beast add little girl way buy new frock sure need old man hurry late mail coach lady gown yellow daffodil go take root botanical 
12,"""Uncle David! there is the very poorest boy I ever saw!"" cried Harry, turning eagerly round; ""he has been standing in the cold here, for ten minutes, looking the picture of misery! he wears no hat, and has pulled his long lank hair to make a bow, about twenty times. Do come and look at him! he is very pale, and his clothes seem to have been made before he began to grow, for they are so much too small, and he is making us many signs to open the window. May I do it?""",uncle be poor boy see cry turn stand cold minute look picture misery wear hat pull long lank hair make bow time come look pale clothes seem make begin grow small make many sign open window do 
13,"""No! no! I never give to chance beggars of that kind, especially young able-bodied fellows like that, because there are so many needy, deserving people whom I visit, who worked as long as they could, and whom I know to be sober and honest. Most of the money we scatter to street beggars goes straight to the gin-shop, and even the very youngest children will buy or steal, to get the means of becoming intoxicated. Only last week, Harry, the landlord of an ale-house at Portobello was seen at the head of a long table, surrounded with ragged beggar boys about twelve or fourteen years of age, who were all perfectly drunk, and probably your friend there might be of the party.""",give chance beggar kind young able bodied fellow be many needy deserving person visit work know sober honest most money scatter street beggar go gin-shop young child buy steal get means become intoxicated last week landlord ale house see head long table surround ragged beggar boy year age drunk friend party 
14,"""Oh no! uncle David! this boy seems quite sober and exceedingly clean, though he is so very poor!"" replied Laura; ""his black trowsers are patched and repatched, his jacket has faded into fifty colours, and his shoes are mended in every direction, but still he looks almost respectable. His face is so thin you might use it for a hatchet. I wish you would take one little peep, for he seems so anxious to speak to us.""",uncle boy seem sober clean poor reply black trowser patch repatch jacket fade colour shoe mend direction look respectable face thin use hatchet wish take little peep seem anxious speak 
15,"""I daresay that! we all know what the youngster has to tell! Probably a wife and six small children at home, or, if you like it better, he will be a shipwrecked sailor at your service. I know the whole affair already; but if you have sixpence to spare, Laura, come with me after breakfast, and we shall bestow it on poor blind Mrs. Wilkie, who has been bed-ridden for the last ten years; or old paralytic Jemmy Dixon the porter, who worked hard as long as he was able. If you had twenty more sixpences, I could tell you of twenty more people who deserve them as much.""",daresay know youngster have tell wife small child home like good shipwreck sailor service know whole affair have sixpence spare come breakfast bestow poor blind bed ride last year old paralytic porter work able have more sixpence tell more person deserve much 
16,"""Very true,"" added Lady Harriet. ""Street beggars, who are young and able to work, like that boy, it is cruelty to encourage. Parents bring up their children in profligate idleness, hoping to gain more money by lying and cheating, than by honest industry, and they too often succeed, especially when the wicked mothers also starve and disfigure these poor creatures, to excite more compassion. We must relieve real distress, Harry, and search for it as we would for hidden treasures, because thus we show our love to God and man; but a large purse with easy strings will do more harm than good.""",true add beggar young able work boy cruelty encourage parent bring child profligate idleness hope gain more money lie cheating honest industry succeed wicked mother starve disfigure poor creature excite more compassion relieve real distress search hidden treasure show love man large purse easy string do more harm good 
17,"""Do you remember, Frank, how long I suspected that old John Davidson was imposing upon me?"" said Major Graham. ""He told such a dismal story always, that I never liked to refuse him some assistance; but yesterday, when he was here, the thought struck me by chance to say, 'What a fine supper you had last night, John!' You should have seen the start he gave, and his look of consternation, when he answered, 'Eh, Sir! how did ye hear of that! We got the turkey very cheap, and none of us took more than two glasses of toddy.'""",remember suspect old impose say tell dismal story like refuse assistance yesterday thought strike chance say fine supper have last night see start give look consternation answer hear get turkey cheap take more glasses toddy 
18,"""That boy is pointing to his pockets, and making more signs for us to open the window!"" exclaimed Laura. ""What can it all mean! he seems so very anxious!""",boy point pocket make more sign open window exclaim mean seem anxious 
19,"Major Graham threw down his knife and fork--rose hastily from breakfast--and flung open the window, calling out in rather a loud, angry voice, ""What do you want, you idle fellow? It is a perfect shame to see you standing there all morning! Surely you don't mean to say that an active youngster like you would disgrace yourself by begging?""",throw knife fork rise breakfast flung open window call loud angry voice want idle fellow perfect shame see stand morning mean say active youngster disgrace begg 
20,"""No, Sir! I want nothing!"" answered the boy respectfully, but colouring to the deepest scarlet. ""I never asked for money in my life, and I never will.""",want answer boy colour deep scarlet ask money life 
21,"""That's right, my good boy!"" answered the Major, instantly changing his tone. ""What brings you here then?""",right good boy answer change tone bring 
22,"""Please, Sir, your servants shut the door in my face, and every body is so hasty like, that I don't know what to do. I can't be listened to for a minute, though I have got something very particular to say, that some one would be glad to hear.""",servant shut door face body hasty know do listen minute get particular say glad hear 
23,"Major Graham now looked exceedingly vexed with himself, for having spoken so roughly to the poor boy, who had a thoughtful, mild, but care-worn countenance, which was extremely interesting, while his manner seemed better than his dress.",look vex speak poor boy have thoughtful mild care wear countenance interesting manner seem good dress 
24,"Frank was despatched, as a most willing messenger, to bring the young stranger up stairs, while uncle David told Harry that he would take this as a lesson to himself ever afterwards, not to judge hastily from appearances, because it was impossible for any one to guess what might be in the mind of another; and he began to hope this boy, who was so civil and well-spoken, might yet turn out to be a proper, industrious little fellow.",despatch willing messenger bring young stranger stair uncle tell take lesson judge appearance impossible one guess mind begin hope boy civil speak turn proper industrious little fellow 
25,"""Well, my lad! Is there anything I can do for you?"" asked Major Graham, when Frank led him kindly into the room. ""What is your name?""",lad be do ask lead room name 
26,"""Evan Mackay, at your service. Please, Sir, did you lose a pocket-book last Thursday, with your name on the back, and nine gold sovereigns inside?""",service lose pocket book last name back gold sovereign 
27,"""Yes! that I did, to my cost! Have you heard anything of it?""",cost hear 
28,"The boy silently drew a parcel from his pocket, and without looking up or speaking, he modestly placed it on the table, then colouring very deeply, he turned away, and hurried towards the door. In another minute he would have been off, but Frank sprung forward and took hold of his arm, saying, in the kindest possible manner, ""Stop, Evan! Stop a moment! That parcel seems to contain all my uncle's money. Where did you get it? Who sent it here?""",boy draw parcel pocket look speak place table colour turn hurry door minute spring take hold arm say kindest possible manner stop stop moment parcel seem contain uncle money get send

30,"""Did you find it yourself then?""",find 
31,"""Yes! it was lying in the street that night when I ran for a Doctor to see my mother, who is dying. She told me now to come back directly, Sir, so I must be going.""",lie street night run doctor see mother die tell come go 
32,"""But let us give you something for being so honest,"" said Frank. ""You are a fine fellow, and you deserve to be well rewarded.""",let give honest say fine fellow deserve reward 
33,"""I only did my duty, Sir. Mother always says we should do right for conscience' sake, and not for a reward.""",do duty mother say do right conscience sake reward 
34,"""Yes! but you are justly entitled to this,"" said Major Graham, taking a sovereign out of the purse. ""I shall do more for you yet, but in the meantime here is what you have honestly earned to-day.""",entitle say take sovereign purse do more meantime earn day 
35,"""If I thought so, Sir,""----said the poor boy, looking wistfully at the glittering coin. ""If I was quite sure there could be no harm----, but I must speak first to mother about it, Sir! She has seen better days once, and she is sadly afraid of my ever taking charity. Mother mends my clothes, and teaches me herself, and works very hard in other ways, but she is quite bed-ridden, and we have scarcely anything but the trifle I make by working in the fields. It is very difficult to get a job at all sometimes, and if you could put me in the way of earning that money, Sir, it would make mother very happy. She is a little particular, and would not taste a morsel that I could get by asking for it.""",think say poor boy look glitter coin sure be harm speak first mother see good day afraid take charity mother mend clothes teach work other way bed ride have trifle make work field difficult get job put way earn money make mother happy little particular taste morsel get ask 
36,"""That is being very proud!"" said Harry.",proud say 
37,"""No, Sir! it is not from pride,"" replied Evan; ""but mother says a merciful God has provided for her many years, and she will not begin to distrust Him now. Her hands are always busy, and her heart is always cheerful. She rears many little plants by her bedside, which we sell, and she teaches a neighbour's children, besides sewing for any one who will employ her, for mother's maxim always was, that there can be no such thing as an idle Christian.""",pride reply mother say merciful provide many year begin distrust hand busy heart cheerful rear many little plant bedside sell teach neighbour child sewing one employ mother maxim be such thing idle 
38,"""Very true!"" said Lady Harriet. ""Even the apostles were mending their nets and labouring hard, whenever they were not teaching. Either the body or the mind should always be active.""",true say apostle mend net labour teach body mind active 
39,"""If you saw mother, that is exactly her way, for she does not eat the bread of idleness. Were a stranger to offer us a blanket or a dinner in charity, she would rather go without any than take it. A very kind lady brought her a gown one day, but mother would only have it if she were allowed to knit as many stockings as would pay for the stuff. I dare not take a penny more for my work than is due, for she says, if once I begin receiving alms, I might get accustomed to it.""",see mother way eat bread idleness stranger offer blanket dinner charity go take kind lady bring gown day mother have allow knit many stocking pay stuff take penny more work due say begin receive alm accustom 
40,"""That is the good old Scotch feeling of former days,"" observed Major Graham. ""It was sometimes carried too far then, but there is not enough of it now. Your mother should have lived fifty years ago.""",good old feeling former day observe carry be enough mother live year 
41,"""You may say so, indeed, Sir! We never had a drop of broth from the soup-kitchen all winter, and many a day we shivered without a fire, though the society offered her sixpence a-week for coals, but she says 'the given morsel is soon done;' and now, many of our neighbours who wasted what they got, feel worse off than we, who are accustomed to suffer want, and to live upon our honest labour. Long ago, if mother went out to tea with any of our neighbours, she always took her own tea along with us.""",say have drop broth soup kitchen winter day shiver fire society offer sixpence week coal say give morsel do many neighbour waste get feel bad accustom suffer want live honest labour mother go tea neighbour take own tea

43,"""Very likely, Sir! but that is different when people can give as good as they get. Last week a kind neighbour sent us some nice loaf bread, but mother made me take it back, with her best thanks, and she preferred our own oat cake. She is more ready to give than to take, Sir, and divides her last bannock, sometimes, with anybody who is worse off than ourselves.""",likely different person give good get last week kind neighbour send nice loaf bread mother make take good thanks prefer own oat cake ready give take divide last bannock bad 
44,"""Poor fellow!"" said Frank, compassionately; ""how much you must often have suffered!""",poor fellow say much suffer 
45,"""Suffered!"" said the boy, with sudden emotion. ""Yes! I have suffered! It matters nothing to be clothed in rags,--to be cold and hungry now! There are worse trials than that! My father died last year, crushed to death in a moment by his own cart-wheels,--my brothers and sisters have all gone to the grave, scarcely able to afford the medicines that might have cured them,--and I am left alone with my poor dying mother. It is a comfort that life is not very long, and we may trust all to God while it lasts.""",suffer say boy sudden emotion suffer matter cloth rag cold hungry be bad trial father die last year crush death moment own cart wheel brother sister go grave able afford medicine cure leave alone poor die mother comfort life long trust last

47,"""Oh, Sir! that young lady could not stay half a minute in the place where my poor mother lives now. It is not a pretty cottage such as we read of in tracts, but a dark cold room, up a high stair, in the narrowest lane you ever saw, with nothing to sit on but an old chest.""",young lady stay minute place poor mother live pretty cottage such read tract dark cold room high stair narrowest lane see sit old chest 
48,"""Never mind that, Evan,"" replied Major Graham. ""You and your mother have a spirit of honour and honesty that might shame many who are lying on sofas of silk and damask. I respect her, and shall assist you if it be possible. Show us the way.""",mind reply mother have spirit honour honesty shame many lie sofa silk damask respect assist possible show way 
49,"Many dirty closes and narrow alleys were threaded by the whole party, before they reached a dark ruinous staircase, where Evan paused and looked round, to see whether Major Graham still approached. He then slowly mounted one flight of ancient crumbling steps after another, lighted by patched and broken windows, till at last they arrived at a narrow wooden flight, perfectly dark. After groping to the summit, they perceived a time-worn door, the latch of which was gently lifted by Evan, who stole noiselessly into the room, followed by uncle David and the wondering children.",many dirty close narrow alley thread whole party reach dark ruinous staircase pause look see approach mount flight ancient crumble step light patch break window last arrive narrow wooden flight dark grope summit perceive time wear door latch lift steal room follow uncle wonder child 
50,"There, a large cold room, nearly empty, but exceedingly clean, presented itself to their notice. In one corner stood a massive old chest of carved oak, surrounded with a perfect glow of geraniums and myrtles in full blossom; beside which were arranged a large antique Bible, a jug of cold water, and a pile of coarsely-knitted worsted stockings. Beyond these, on a bed of clean straw, lay a tall, emaciated old woman, apparently in the last stage of life, with a face haggard by suffering; and yet her thin, withered hands were busily occupied with needle-work, while, in low, faltering tones, she chanted these words,",large cold room empty clean present notice corner stand massive old chest carve oak surround perfect glow geranium myrtle full blossom arrange large antique jug cold water pile knite worst stocking bed clean straw lay tall emaciated old woman last stage life face haggard suffer thin wither hand occupy needle work low falter tone chant word

53,"""Good day, Mrs. Mackay,"" added Major Graham, in a voice of great consideration, while she languidly turned her head towards the door. ""I have come to thank you for restoring my purse this morning.""",good day add voice great consideration turn head door come thank restore purse morning 
54,"""You are kindly welcome, Sir! What else could we do!"" replied she, in a feeble, tremulous voice. ""The money was yours, and the sooner it went out of our hands the better.""",welcome do reply feeble tremulous voice money go hand good 
55,"""It was perfectly safe while it stayed there,"" added Major Graham, not affecting to speak in a homely accent, nor putting on any airs of condescension at all, but sitting down on the old chest as if he had never sat on any thing but a chest in his life before, and looking at the clean bare floor with as much respect as if it had been a Turkey carpet. ""Your little boy's pocket seems to be as safe as the Bank of Scotland.""",safe stay add affect speak homely accent put air condescension sit old chest sit thing chest life look clean bare floor much respect carpet little boy pocket seem safe 
56,"""That is very true, Sir! My boy is honest; and it is well to keep a good conscience, as that is all he has in this world to live for. Many have a heavy conscience to carry with a heavy purse; but these he need not envy. If we are poor in this world, we are rich in faith; and I trust the money was not even a temptation to Evan, because he has learned from the best of all teachers, that it would 'profit him nothing to gain the whole world, and lose his own soul.'""",true boy honest well keep good conscience have world live many have heavy conscience carry heavy purse envy poor world rich faith trust money temptation learn good teacher profit gain whole world lose own soul 
57,"""True, Mrs. Mackay! most true! We have come here this morning to request that you and he will do me the favour to accept of a small recompense.""",true true come morning request do favour accept small recompense 
58,"""We are already rewarded, Sir! This has been an opportunity of testifying to our own hearts that we desire to do right in the eye of God. At the same time, it was Providence who kindly directed my son's steps to the place where that money was lying; and if anything seems justly due to poor Evan, let him have it. My wants are few, and must soon be ended. But oh! when I look at that boy, and think of the long years he may be struggling with poverty and temptation, my heart melts within me, and my whole spirit is broken. Faith itself seems to fail, and I could be a beggar for him now! It is not money I would ask, Sir, because that might soon be spent; but get him some honest employment, and I will thank you on my very knees.""",reward opportunity testify own heart desire do eye same time direct son step place money lie seem due poor let have want few end look boy think long year struggle poverty temptation heart melt whole spirit break faith seem fail beggar money ask spend get honest employment thank very knee 
59,"Evan seemed startled at the sudden energy of his mother's manner, and tears sprung into his eyes while she spoke with a degree of agitation so different from what he had ever heard before; but he struggled to conceal his feelings, and she continued with increasing emotion,",seem startle sudden energy mother manner tear spring eye speak degree agitation different hear struggle conceal feeling continue increase emotion 
60,"""Bodily suffering, and many a year of care and sorrow, are fast closing their work on me. The moments are passing away like a weaver's shuttle; and if I had less anxiety about Evan, how blessed a prospect it would appear; but that is the bitterness of death to me now. My poor, poor boy! I would rather hear he was in the way of earning his livelihood, than that he got a hundred a-year. Tell me, Sir!--and oh! consider you are speaking to a dying creature--can you possibly give him any creditable employment, where he might gain a crust of bread, and be independent?""",bodily suffering many year care sorrow fast close work moment pass weaver shuttle have less anxiety bless prospect appear bitterness death poor poor boy hear way earn livelihood get year tell consider speak die creature give creditable employment gain crust bread independent 
61,"""I honour your very proper feeling on the subject, Mrs. Mackay, and shall help Evan to the best of my ability,"" replied Major Graham, in a tone of seriousness and sincerity. ""To judge by these fine geraniums, he must be fond of cultivating plants; and we want an under-gardener in the country; therefore he shall have that situation without loss of time.""",honour proper feeling subject help good ability reply tone seriousness sincerity judge fine geranium fond cultivate plant want gardener country have situation loss time 
62,"""Oh, mother! mother! speak no more of dying! You will surely get better now!"" said Evan, looking up, while his thin pale face assumed a momentary glow of pleasure. ""Try now to get better!

We shall be so happy now!""",mother mother speak more die get good say look thin pale face assume momentary glow pleasure try get good work wait see come happy 
63,"""Yes! I am happy!"" said Mrs. Mackay, solemnly looking towards heaven, with an expression that could not be mistaken. ""The last cord is cut that bound me to the earth; and may you, Sir, find hereafter the blessings that are promised to those who visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction.""",happy say look heaven expression mistaken last cord cut bind earth find blessing promise visit fatherless widow affliction
