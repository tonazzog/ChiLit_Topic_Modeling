3," South-west wind, Esquire, was as good as his word. After the momentous visit above related, he entered the Treasure Valley no more; and, what was worse, he had so much influence with his relations, the West Winds in general, and used it so effectually, that they all adopted a similar line of conduct. So no rain fell in the valley from one year's end to another. Though everything remained green and flourishing in the plains below, the inheritance of the Three Brothers was a desert. What had once been the richest soil in the kingdom, became a shifting heap of red sand; and the brothers, unable longer to contend with the adverse skies, abandoned their valueless patrimony in despair, to seek some means of gaining a livelihood among the cities and people of the plains. All their money was gone, and they had nothing left but some curious old-fashioned pieces of gold plate, the last remnants of their ill-gotten wealth.",west wind good word momentous visit related enter bad have much influence relation general use adopt similar line conduct rain fall valley year end remain green flourish plain inheritance desert rich soil kingdom become shift heap red sand brother unable contend adverse sky abandon valueless patrimony despair seek means gain livelihood city person plain money gone have leave curious old fashioned piece gold plate last remnant ill get wealth

5,"""Suppose we turn goldsmiths?"" said Schwartz to Hans, as they entered the large city. ""It is a good knave's trade; we can put a great deal of copper into the gold, without any one's finding it out.""",suppose turn goldsmith say enter large city good knave trade put great deal copper gold one find 
6,"The thought was agreed to be a very good one; they hired a furnace, and turned goldsmiths. But two slight circumstances affected their trade: the first, that people did not approve of the coppered gold; the second, that the two elder brothers, whenever they had sold anything, used to leave little Gluck to mind the furnace, and go and drink out the money in the ale-house next door. So they melted all their gold, without making money enough to buy more, and were at last reduced to one large drinking mug, which an uncle of his had given to little Gluck, and which he was very fond of, and would not have parted with for the world; though he never drank anything out of it but milk and water. The mug was a very odd mug to look at. The handle was formed of two wreaths of flowing golden hair, so finely spun that it looked more like silk than metal, and these wreaths descended into, and mixed with, a beard and whiskers of the same exquisite workmanship, which surrounded and decorated a very fierce little face, of the reddest gold imaginable, right in the front of the mug, with a pair of eyes in it which seemed to command its whole circumference. It was impossible to drink out of the mug without being subjected to an intense gaze out of the side of these eyes; and Schwartz positively averred, that once, after emptying it, full of Rhenish, seventeen times, he had seen them wink! When it came to the mug's turn to be made into spoons, it half broke poor little Gluck's heart; but the brothers only laughed at him, tossed the mug into the melting-pot, and staggered out to the ale-house: leaving him, as usual, to pour the gold into bars, when it was all ready.",thought agree good one hire furnace turn goldsmith slight circumstance affect trade first person approve copper gold second elder brother sell use leave little mind furnace go drink money ale house next door melt gold make money buy more last reduce large drinking mug uncle give little fond part world drink milk water mug odd mug look handle form wreath flow golden hair spun look silk metal wreath descend mix beard whisker same exquisite workmanship surround decorate fierce little face reddest gold imaginable front mug pair eye seem command whole circumference impossible drink mug subject intense gaze side eye averr empty full time see wink come mug turn make spoon half break poor little heart brother laugh toss mug melting pot stagger ale house leave usual pour gold bar ready 
7,"When they were gone, Gluck took a farewell look at his old friend in the melting-pot. The flowing hair was all gone; nothing remained but the red nose, and the sparkling eyes, which looked more malicious than ever. ""And no wonder,"" thought Gluck, ""after being treated in that way."" He sauntered disconsolately to the window, and sat himself down to catch the fresh evening air, and escape the hot breath of the furnace. Now this window commanded a direct view of the range of mountains, which, as I told you before, overhung the Treasure Valley, and more especially of the peak from which fell the Golden River. It was just at the close of the day, and, when Gluck sat down at the window, he saw the rocks of the mountain tops, all crimson and purple with the sunset; and there were bright tongues of fiery cloud burning and quivering about them; and the river, brighter than all, fell, in a waving column of pure gold, from precipice to precipice, with the double arch of a broad purple rainbow stretched across it, flushing and fading alternately in the wreaths of spray.",gone take farewell look old friend melting pot flow hair gone remain red nose sparkling eye look malicious wonder think treat way saunter window sit catch fresh evening air escape hot breath furnace window command direct view range mountain tell overh peak fall golden close day sit window see rock mountain top crimson purple sunset be bright tongue fiery cloud burning quiver river bright fall wave column pure gold precipice precipice double arch broad purple rainbow stretch flush fade wreath spray

9,"""Ah!"" said Gluck aloud, after he had looked at it for a while, ""if that river were really all gold, what a nice thing it would be.""",say look while river gold nice thing 
10,"""No, it wouldn't, Gluck,"" said a clear, metallic voice, close at his ear.",say clear metallic voice close ear 
11,"""Bless me, what's that?"" exclaimed Gluck, jumping up. There was nobody there. He looked round the room, and under the table, and a great many times behind him, but there was certainly nobody there, and he sat down again at the window. This time he didn't speak, but he couldn't help thinking again that it would be very convenient if the river were really all gold.",bless exclaim jump be look room table great many time be sit window time speak help think convenient river gold 
12,"""Not at all, my boy,"" said the same voice, louder than before.",boy say same voice louder 
13,"""Bless me!"" said Gluck again, ""what _is_ that?"" He looked again into all the corners and cupboards, and then began turning round and round as fast as he could in the middle of the room, thinking there was somebody behind him, when the same voice struck again on his ear. It was singing now, very merrily, ""Lala-lira-la;"" no words, only a soft running effervescent melody, something like that of a kettle on the boil. Gluck looked out of the window. No, it was certainly in the house. Up stairs, and down stairs. No, it was certainly in that very room, coming in quicker time and clearer notes every moment. ""Lala-lira-la."" All at once it struck Gluck that it sounded louder near the furnace. He ran to the opening and looked in; yes, he saw right, it seemed to be coming, not only out of the furnace, but out of the pot. He uncovered it, and ran back in a great fright, for the pot was certainly singing! He stood in the farthest corner of the room, with his hands up and his mouth open, for a minute or two, when the singing stopped, and the voice became clear and pronunciative.",bless say look corner cupboard begin turn middle room think be same voice strike ear sing word soft run effervescent melody kettle boil look window house stair stair very room come quick time clear note moment strike sound louder furnace run opening look see right seem come furnace pot uncover run great fright pot sing stand farthest corner room hand mouth open minute singing stop voice become clear pronunciative

16,"""Hollo! Gluck, my boy,"" said the pot again.",boy say pot 
17,"Gluck summoned all his energies, walked straight up to the crucible, drew it out of the furnace, and looked in. The gold was all melted, and its surface as smooth and polished as a river; but instead of reflecting little Gluck's head, as he looked in he saw meeting his glance from beneath the gold, the red nose and sharp eyes of his old friend of the mug, a thousand times redder and sharper than ever he had seen them in his life.",summon energy walk crucible draw furnace look gold melt surface smooth polished river reflect little head look see meet glance gold red nose sharp eye old friend mug time redder sharper see life

22,"""_Will_ you pour me out?"" said the voice, passionately. ""I'm too hot.""",pour say voice hot 
23,"By a violent effort, Gluck recovered the use of his limbs, took hold of the crucible and sloped it, so as to pour out the gold. But, instead of a liquid stream, there came out, first a pair of pretty little yellow legs, then some coat tails, then a pair of arms stuck a-kimbo, and finally the well-known head of his friend the mug; all which articles, uniting as they rolled out, stood up energetically on the floor, in the shape of a little golden dwarf, about a foot and a half high.",violent effort recover use limb take hold crucible slope pour gold liquid stream come pair pretty little yellow leg coat tail pair arm stick kimbo know head friend mug article unite roll stand floor shape little golden dwarf foot half high 
24,,
25,"""That's right!"" said the dwarf, stretching out first his legs, and then his arms, and then shaking his head up and down, and as far round as it would go, for five minutes without stopping, apparently with the view of ascertaining if he were quite correctly put together, while Gluck stood contemplating him in speechless amazement. He was dressed in a slashed doublet of spun gold, so fine in its texture, that the prismatic colours gleamed over it as if on a surface of mother of pearl; and, over this brilliant doublet, his hair and beard fell full half way to the ground in waving curls, so exquisitely delicate, that Gluck could hardly tell where they ended; they seemed to melt into air. The features of the face, however, were by no means finished with the same delicacy; they were rather coarse, slightly inclining to coppery in complexion, and indicative, in expression, of a very pertinacious and intractable disposition in their small proprietor. When the dwarf had finished his self-examination, he turned his small sharp eyes full on Gluck, and stared at him deliberately for a minute or two. ""No, it wouldn't, Gluck, my boy,"" said the little man.",right say dwarf stretch first leg arm shake head go minute stop view ascertain put stand contemplate speechless amazement dress slash doublet spun gold fine texture prismatic colour gleam surface mother pearl brilliant doublet hair beard fall full ground wave curl delicate tell end seem melt air feature face means finish same delicacy coarse incline coppery complexion indicative expression pertinacious intractable disposition small proprietor dwarf finish self examination turn small sharp eye full stare minute boy say little man 
26,"This was certainly rather an abrupt and unconnected mode of commencing conversation. It might indeed be supposed to refer to the course of Gluck's thoughts, which had first produced the dwarfs observations out of the pot; but whatever it referred to, Gluck had no inclination to dispute the dictum.",abrupt unconnected mode commence conversation suppose refer course thought produce dwarf observation pot refer have inclination dispute dictum 
27,"""Wouldn't it, sir?"" said Gluck, very mildly and submissively indeed.",sir say 
28,"""No,"" said the dwarf, conclusively, ""no, it wouldn't."" And with that the dwarf pulled his cap hard over his brows, and took two turns, of three feet long, up and down the room, lifting his legs up very high, and setting them down very hard. This pause gave time for Gluck to collect his thoughts a little, and, seeing no great reason to view his diminutive visitor with dread, and feeling his curiosity overcome his amazement, he ventured on a question of peculiar delicacy.",say dwarf dwarf pull cap brow take turn foot long room lift leg high set pause give time collect thought little see great reason view diminutive visitor dread feel curiosity overcome amazement venture question peculiar delicacy 
29,"""Pray, sir,"" said Gluck, rather hesitatingly, ""were you my mug?""",pray sir say mug 
30,"On which the little man turned sharp round, walked straight up to Gluck, and drew himself up to his full height. ""I,"" said the little man, ""am the King of the Golden River."" Whereupon he turned about again, and took two more turns, some six feet long, in order to allow time for the consternation which this announcement produced in his auditor to evaporate. After which, he again walked up to Gluck and stood still, as if expecting some comment on his communication.",little man turn sharp walk draw full height say little man golden turn take more turn foot order allow time consternation announcement produce auditor evaporate walk stand expect comment communication 
31,"Gluck determined to say something at all events. ""I hope your Majesty is very well,"" said Gluck.",determine say event hope say 
32,"""Listen!"" said the little man, deigning no reply to this polite inquiry. ""I am the King of what you mortals call the Golden River. The shape you saw me in, was owing to the malice of a stronger king, from whose enchantments you have this instant freed me. What I have seen of you, and your conduct to your wicked brothers, renders me willing to serve you; therefore, attend to what I tell you. Whoever shall climb to the top of that mountain from which you see the Golden River issue, and shall cast into the stream at its source, three drops of holy water, for him, and for him only, the river shall turn to gold. But no one failing in his first, can succeed in a second attempt; and if any one shall cast unholy water into the river, it will overwhelm him, and he will become a black stone."" So saying, the King of the Golden River turned away and deliberately walked into the centre of the hottest flame of the furnace. His figure became red, white, transparent, dazzling,--a blaze of intense light,--rose, trembled, and disappeared. The King of the Golden River had evaporated.",listen say little man deign reply polite inquiry mortal call golden shape see ow malice strong king enchantment have instant free see conduct wicked brother render willing serve attend tell climb top mountain see golden issue cast stream source drop holy water river turn gold fail first succeed second attempt one cast unholy water river overwhelm become black stone say golden turn walk centre hot flame furnace figure become red white transparent dazzling blaze intense light rise tremble disappear golden evaporate
