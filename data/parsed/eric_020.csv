3,"Owen and Montagu were walking by Silverburn, and talking over the affairs of the school. During their walk they saw Wright and Vernon Williams in front of them.",walk talk affair school walk see front 
4,"""I am so glad to see those two together,"" said Montagu; ""I really think Wright is one of the best little fellows in the school, and he'll be the saving of Vernon. He's already persuaded him to leave off smoking and other bad things, and has got him to work a little harder, and turn over a new leaf altogether.""",glad see say think good little fellow school save persuade leave smoking other bad thing get work little hard turn new leaf 
5,"""Yes,"" answered Owen; ""I've seen a marvellous improvement in little Williams lately. I think that Duncan gave him a rough lesson the other night which did him good, and dear old Rose too has been leading him by the hand; but the best thing is that, through Wright, he sees less of Eric's _friend_, that young scapegrace Wildney.""",answer see marvellous improvement little think give rough lesson other night do good dear old lead hand good thing see less young scapegrace 
6,"""Yes; that little wretch has a good deal to answer for. What a pity that Eric spoils him so, or rather suffers himself to be spoilt by him. I'm glad Vernon's escaped his influence now; he's too fine a boy to be made as bad as the general run of them. What a brilliant little fellow he is; just like his brother.""",little wretch have good deal answer pity spoil suffer spoil glad escape influence fine boy make bad general run brilliant little fellow brother 
7,"""Just like what his brother _was_,"" said Owen; ""his face, like his mind, has suffered lately.""",brother say face mind suffer 
8,"""Too true,"" answered Montagu, with a sigh; ""and yet, cool as we now are in our outward intercourse, he little knows how I love him, and yearn for the Eric I once knew. Would to God poor Russell had lived, and then I believe that Williams wouldn't have gone so for wrong.""",true answer sigh cool outward intercourse little know love yearn know poor live believe go wrong 
9,"""Well, I think there's another chance for him now that--that--what name is bad enough, for that Brigson?--is gone.""",think be chance name bad gone 
10,"""I hope so. But""--he added after a pause--""his works do follow him. Look there!"" He took a large stone and threw it into the Silverburn stream; there was a great splash, and then ever-widening circles of blue ripple broke the surface of the water, dying away one by one in the sedges on the bank. ""There,"" he said, ""see how long those ripples last, and how numerous they are.""",hope add pause work follow look take large stone throw stream be great splash widen circle blue ripple break surface water die sedge bank say see ripple last numerous 
11,"Owen understood him. ""Poor Williams! What a gleam of new hope there was in him after Russell's death!""",understand poor gleam new hope be death 
12,"""Yes, for a time,"" said Montagu; ""heigh ho! I fear we shall never be warm friends again. We can't be while he goes on as he is doing. And yet I love him.""",time say fear warm friend go do love 
13,A sudden turn of the stream brought them to the place called Riverbend.,sudden turn stream bring place call 
14,"""If you want a practical comment on what we've been talking about, you'll see it there,"" said Montagu.",want practical comment talk see say 
15,"He pointed to a party of boys, four or five, all lying on a pleasant grass bank, smoking pipes. Prominent among them was Eric, stretched at ease, and looking up at the clouds, towards which curled the puffed fumes of his meerschaum--a gift of Wildney's. That worthy was beside him similarly employed.",point party boy lie pleasant grass bank smoking pipe prominent stretch ease look cloud curl puff fume meerschaum gift worthy employ 
16,"The two sixth-form boys hoped to pass by unobserved, as they did not wish for a rencontre with our hero under such circumstances. But they saw Wildney pointing to them, and, from the fits of laughter which followed his remarks, they had little doubt that they were the subject of the young gentleman's wit. This is never a pleasant sensation; but they observed that Eric made a point of not looking their way, and went on in silence.",sixth form boy hope pass unobserved wish rencontre hero such circumstance see point fit laughter follow remark have little doubt subject young gentleman wit pleasant sensation observe make point look way go silence

22,"""What?""",
23,"""I saw them drinking. I have little doubt it was brandy.""",see drink have little doubt brandy 
24,"""Good heavens!""",good heaven

26,"Before they got home they caught up Wright and Vernon, and walked in together.",get catch walk 
27,"""We've been talking,"" said Wright, ""about a bad matter. Vernon here says that there's no good working for a prize in his form, because the cribbing's so atrocious. Indeed, it's very nearly as bad in my form. It always is under Gordon; he _can't_ understand fellows doing dishonorable things.""",talk say bad matter say be good working prize form cribbing atrocious bad form understand fellow do dishonorable thing 
28,"""It's a great bore in the weekly examinations,"" said Vernon; ""every now and then Gordon will even leave the room for a few minutes, and then out come dozens of books.""",great bore weekly examination say leave room few minute come dozen book 
29,"""Well, Wright,"" said Montagu, ""if that happens again next examination, I'd speak out about it.""",say happen next examination speak 
30,"""How?""",
31,"""Why, I'd get every fellow who disapproves of it to give me his name, and get up and read the list, and say that you at least have pledged yourselves not to do it.""",get fellow disapprove give name get read list say least pledge do 
32,"""Humph! I don't know how that would answer. They'd half kill me for one thing.""",humph know answer half kill thing 
33,"""Never mind; do your duty. I wish I'd such an opportunity, if only to show how sorry I am for my own past unfairness.""",mind do duty wish opportunity show sorry own past unfairness 
34,"And so talking, the four went in, and the two elder went to their study.",talk go elder go study 
35,"It was too true that drinking had become a common vice at Roslyn school. Accordingly, when Eric came in with Wildney about half an hour after, Owen and Montagu heard them talk about ordering some brandy, and then arrange to have a ""jollification,"" that evening.",true drinking become common vice school come hour hear talk order brandy arrange have jollification evening 
36,"They got the brandy through ""Billy."" One of Brigson's most cursed legacies to the school was the introduction of this man to a nefarious intercourse with the boys. His character was so well known that it had long been forbidden, under the strictest penalty, for any boy ever to speak to him; yet, strange to say, they seemed to take a pleasure in doing so, and just now particularly it was thought a fine thing, a sign of ""pluck"" and ""anti-muffishness,"" to be on familiar and intimate terms with that degraded and villainous scoundrel.",get brandy curse legacy school introduction man nefarious intercourse boy character know forbidden strictest penalty boy speak strange say seem take pleasure do think fine thing sign pluck anti muffishness familiar intimate term degrade villainous scoundrel 
37,"Duncan had made friends again with Eric; but he did not join him in his escapades and excesses, and sat much in other studies. He had not been altogether a good boy, but yet there was a sort of rough honesty and good sense about him, which preserved him from the worst and most dangerous failings, and his character had been gradually improving as he mounted higher in the school. He was getting steadier, more diligent, more thoughtful, more manly; he was passing through that change so frequent in boys as they grow older, to which Eric was so sad an exception. Accordingly Duncan, though sincerely fond of Eric, had latterly disapproved vehemently of his proceedings, and had therefore taken to snubbing his old friend Wildney, in whose favor Eric seemed to have an infatuation, and who was the means of involving him in every kind of impropriety and mischief. So that night Duncan, hearing of what was intended, sat in the next study, and Eric, with Bull, Wildney, Graham, and Pietrie, had the room to themselves. Several of them were lower boys still, but they came to the studies after bed-time, according to Wildney's almost nightly custom.",make friend join escapade excess sit much other study good boy be sort rough honesty good sense preserve bad dangerous failing character improve mount high school get steady diligent thoughtful manly pass change frequent boy grow old sad exception fond disapprove proceedings take snubb old friend favor seem have infatuation means involve kind impropriety mischief night hear intend sit next study have room several low boy come study bed time accord nightly custom 
38,A little pebble struck the study window.,little pebble strike study window 
39,"""Hurrah!"" said Wildney, clapping his hands, ""here's the grub.""",say clap hand grub 
40,"They opened the window and looked out. Billy was there, and they let down to him a long piece of cord, to which he attached a basket, and, after bidding them ""Good night, and a merry drink,"" retired. No sooner had they shut the window, than he grimaced as usual towards them, and shook his fist in a sort of demoniacal exultation, muttering, ""Oh, I'll have you all under my thumb yet, you fine young fools!""",open window look let long piece cord attach basket bid good night merry drink retire shut window grimace usual shake fist sort demoniacal exultation mutter have thumb fine young fool 
41,"Meanwhile the unconscious boys had opened the basket, and spread its contents on the table. They were, bread, a large dish of sausages, a tart, beer, and, alas! a bottle of brandy.",unconscious boy open basket spread content table bread large dish sausages tart beer bottle brandy 
42,"They soon got very noisy, and at last uproarious. The snatches of songs, peals of laughter, and rattle of plates, at last grew so loud that the other study-boys were afraid lest one of the masters should come up and catch the revellers. All of them heard every word that was spoken by Eric and his party as the walls between the rooms were very thin; and very objectionable much of the conversation was.",get noisy last uproarious snatch song peal laughter rattle plate last grow loud other study boy afraid master come catch reveller hear word speak party wall room thin objectionable much conversation 
43,"""This _won't_ do,"" said Duncan emphatically, after a louder burst of merriment than usual; ""those fellows are getting drunk; I can tell it to a certainty from the confused and random way in which some of them are talking.""",do say louder burst merriment usual fellow get drunk tell certainty confused random way talk 
44,"""We'd better go in and speak to them,"" said Montagu; ""at any rate, they've no right to disturb us all night. Will you come?""",go speak say rate have right disturb night come 
45,"""I'll join you,"" said Owen; ""though I'm afraid my presence won't do you much good.""",join say afraid presence do good 
46,"The three boys went to the door of Eric's study, and their knock could not at first be heard for the noise. When they went in they found a scene of reckless disorder; books were scattered about, plates and glasses lay broken on the floor, beer was spilt on all sides, and there was an intolerable smell of brandy.",boy go door study knock hear noise go find scene reckless disorder book scatter plate glasses break floor beer spilt side be intolerable smell brandy 
47,"""If you fellows don't care,"" said Duncan, sharply, ""Rose or somebody'll be coming up and catching you. It's ten now.""",fellow care say come catching 
48,"""What's that to you?"" answered Graham, with an insolent look.",answer insolent look

51,"""Spree!"" burst in Montagu indignantly; ""fine spree, to make sots of yourselves with spirits; fine spree, to----""",burst fine spree make sot spirit fine spree 
52,"""Amen!"" said Wildney, who was perched on the back of a chair; and he turned up his eyes and clasped his hands with a mock-heroic air.",say perch back chair turn eye clasp hand mock heroic air 
53,"""There, Williams,"" continued Montagu, pointing to the mischievous-looking little boy; ""see that spectacle, and be ashamed of yourself, if you can. That's what you lead boys to! Are you anxious to become the teacher of drunkenness?""",continue point mischievous look little boy see spectacle ashamed lead boy anxious become teacher drunkenness 
54,"In truth, there was good ground for his sorrowful apostrophe, for the scene was very painful to a high-minded witness.",truth be good ground sorrowful apostrophe scene painful high minded witness 
55,"They hardly understood the look on Eric's countenance; he had been taking far more than was good for him; his eyes sparkled fiercely, and though as yet he said nothing, he seemed to be resenting the intrusion in furious silence.",understand look countenance take more good eye sparkle say seem resent intrusion furious silence 
56,"""How much longer is this interesting lecture to last?"" asked Bull, with his usual insufferable drawl; ""for I want to finish my brandy.""",interesting lecture last ask usual insufferable drawl want finish brandy 
57,"Montagu rather looked as if he intended to give the speaker a box on the ear; but he was just deciding that Bull wasn't worth the trouble, when Wildney, who had been grimacing all the time, burst into a fit of laughter.",look intend give speaker box ear decide worth trouble grimace time burst fit laughter 
58,"""Let's turn out these impudent lower-school fellows,"" said Montagu, speaking to Duncan. ""Here! you go first,"" he said, seizing Wildney by the arm, and giving him a swing, which, as he was by no means steady on his legs, brought him sprawling to the ground.",let turn impudent low school fellow say speak go say seize arm give swing means steady leg bring sprawl ground 
59,"""By Jove, I won't stand this any longer,"" shouted Eric, springing up ferociously. ""What on earth do you mean by daring to come in like this? Do you hear?""",stand shout spring earth mean dare come hear 
60,"Montagu took no sort of notice of his threatening gesture, for he was looking to see if Wildney was hurt, and finding he was not, proceeded to drag him out, struggling and kicking frantically.",take sort notice threatening gesture look see hurt find proceed drag struggle kick 
61,"""Drop me, you fellow, drop me, I say. I won't go for you,"" cried Wildney, shaking with passion. ""Eric, why do you let him bully me?""",drop fellow drop say go cry shake passion let bully 
62,"""You let him go this minute,"" repeated Eric, hoarsely.",let go minute repeat 
63,"""I shall do no such thing. You don't know what you're about.""",do such thing know 
64,"""Don't I? Well, then, take _that_, to show whether I do or no!"" and suddenly leaning forward, he struck Montagu a violent back-handed blow on the mouth.",take show do lean strike violent back hand blow mouth 
65,"Everybody saw it, everybody heard it; and it instantly astounded them into silence. That Montagu should have been struck in public, and that by Eric--by a boy who had loved him, and whom he had loved--by a boy who had been his schoolfellow for three years now, and whose whole life seemed bound to him by so many associations; it was strange, and sad indeed.",see hear astound silence strike public boy love love boy schoolfellow year whole life seem bind many association strange sad 
66,"Montagu sprang straight upright; for an instant he took one stride towards his striker with lifted hand and lightning eyes, while the blood started to his lips in consequence of the blow. But he stopped suddenly and his hand fell to his side; by a strong effort of self-control he contrived to master himself, and sitting down quite quietly on a chair, he put his white handkerchief to his wounded mouth, and took it away stained with blood.",spring instant take stride striker lift hand lightning eye blood start lip consequence blow stop hand fall side strong effort self control contrive master sit chair put white handkerchief wound mouth take stain blood 
67,"No one spoke; and rising with quiet dignity, he went back into his study without a word.",speak rise quiet dignity go study word 
68,"""Very well,"" said Duncan; ""you may all do as you like; only I heartily hope now you will be caught. Come, Owen.""",say do like hope catch come 
69,"""Oh, Williams,"" said Owen, ""you are changed indeed, to treat your best friend so.""",say change treat good friend 
70,"But Eric was excited with drink, and the slave of every evil passion at that moment. ""Serve him right,"" he said; ""what business has he to interfere with what I choose to do?""",excite drink slave evil passion moment serve say business have interfere choose do 
71,"There was no more noise that night. Wildney and the rest slunk off ashamed and frightened, and Eric, leaving his candle flaring on the table, went down to his bed-room, where he was very sick. He had neither strength nor spirit to undress, and flung himself into bed just as was. When they heard that he was gone, Owen and Duncan (for Montagu was silent and melancholy) went into his study, put out the candle, and had only just cleared away, to the best of their power, the traces of the carouse, when Dr. Rowlands came up stairs on his usual nightly rounds. They had been lighting brown paper to take away the fumes of the brandy, and the Doctor asked them casually the cause of the smell of burning. Neither of them answered, and seeing Owen there, in whom he placed implicit trust, the Doctor thought no more about it.",be more noise night rest slunk ashamed frighten leave candle flare table go bed room sick have strength spirit undress flung bed hear gone silent melancholy go study put candle clear good power trace carouse come stair usual nightly round light brown paper take fume brandy ask cause smell burning answer see place implicit trust think more 
72,"Eric awoke with a bad headache, and a sense of shame and sickness. When he got up he felt most wretched, and while washing he thought to himself, ""Ah! that I could thus wash away the memory of last night!"" Of course, after what had occurred, Eric and Montagu were no longer on speaking terms, and miserable as poor Eric felt when he saw how his blow had bruised and disfigured his friend's face, he made no advances. He longed, indeed, from his inmost heart, to be reconciled to him; but feeling that he had done grievous wrong, he dreaded a repulse, and his pride would not suffer him to run the risk. So he pretended to feel no regret, and, supported by his late boon-companions, represented the matter as occurring in the defence of Wildney, whom Montagu was bullying.",awoke bad headache sense shame sickness get feel wretch wash think wash memory last night course occur speak term miserable poor feel see blow bruise disfigure friend face make advance long inmost heart reconcile feel do grievous wrong dread repulse pride suffer run risk pretend feel regret support late boon companion represent matter occur defence bullying 
73,"Montagu, too, was very miserable; but he felt that, although ready to forgive Eric, he could not, in common self-respect, take the first step to a reconciliation: indeed, he rightly thought that it was not for Eric's good that he should do so.",miserable feel ready forgive common self respect take first step reconciliation think good do 
74,"""You and Williams appear never to speak to each other now,"" said Mr. Rose. ""I am sorry for it, Monty; I think you are the only boy who has any influence over him.""",appear speak other say sorry think only boy have influence
