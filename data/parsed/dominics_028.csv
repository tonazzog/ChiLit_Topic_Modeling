1,"CHAPTER 27. THE ""DOMINICAN"" ON THE SITUATION.",situation 
2,The examination at the beginning of the term had seriously interfered with the prospects of the _Dominican_.  Pembury knew well enough it was no good trying to get anything out of the diligent section of his class-fellows at such a time; and he knew equally well that a number contributed entirely by the idlers of the Fifth would neither be creditable to the paper nor appreciated by any one outside.,examination beginning term interfer prospect know good try get diligent section class fellow time know number contribute idler fifth creditable paper appreciate one

13,"""Why, the fact is,"" said Ricketts, ""I fancy the Fifth is not exactly looking up at present, and we've nothing particular to be proud of.  If you take my advice you'll keep the _Dominican_ quiet for a bit.""",fact say fancy fifth look present have particular proud take advice keep quiet bit 
14,"""My dear fellow, that's the very thing we mustn't do.  Don't you see, you old duffer you, that if we shut up shop and retire into private life, everybody will be thinking we daren't hold up our heads?  I mean to hold up my head, for one,"" added Tony, proudly, ""if there were a thousand Greenfields in the class; and I mean to make you hold up yours too, old man.  It'll be time enough to do the hang-dog business when we all turn knaves; but till we do, we've as good a right to be known at Saint Dominic's as anybody else.  So none of your humbug, Rick.

16,"Tony was not the fellow to let an advantage go by.  Having once got his men into a becoming frame of mind, he kept them well in hand and worked them up into something like the old enthusiasm on the subject of the _Dominican_.",fellow let advantage go get man become frame mind keep hand work old enthusiasm subject 
17,"Every one was determined the present number should be an out-and-out good one, and laboured and racked his brains accordingly.",one determine present number good one laboure rack brain 
18,"But somehow or other the fellows had never found it so hard, first to get inspirations, and then to put them down on paper, as they did at present.  Every one thought he had something very fine and very clever to say if he could only find expression for it.  The amount of brain-cudgelling that went on over this _Dominican_ was simply awful. Wraysford gave it up in disgust.  Ricketts, Bullinger, Tom Senior, and others stumbled through their tasks, and could only turn out lame productions at the best.  Even Pembury's lucubrations lacked a good deal of their wonted dash and spirit.  The cloud which was hanging over the Fifth seemed to have overshadowed its genius for a while.",other fellow find hard first get inspiration put paper present one think have fine clever say find expression amount brain cudgelling go awful give disgust other stumble task turn lame production good lucubration lack good deal wont dash spirit cloud hang fifth seem overshadow genius while 
19,"Still Pembury kept his men at it and gave them no peace till their productions, such as they were, were safe in his hands.  One boy only was equal to the emergency; that I need hardly say was Simon.  He was indeed more eloquent than ever.  He offered Pembury a poem of forty verses, entitled, ""An Elegy on the Wick of a Candle that had just been blown out,"" to begin with, and volunteered to supplement this contribution with one or two smaller pieces, such as, ""My Little Lark,"" or ""An Adventure outside the Dormitory Door,"" or ""Mind Mewsings.""",keep man give peace production such safe hand boy equal emergency need say eloquent offer poem verse entitle blow begin volunteer supplement contribution small piece such little 
20,"Pembury prudently accepted all, and said he would insert what he thought fit, an assurance which delighted Simon, who immediately sat down and wrote some more ""pieces,"" in case at the last moment there might be room for them too.  But, in spite even of these valuable contributions, the _Dominican_ fell flat.  There were a few good things in it here and there, but it was far below its ordinary form; and not a few of the writers repented sorely that ever they had put pen to paper to help produce it.",accept say insert think fit assurance delight sit write more piece case last moment be room spite valuable contribution fall flat be few good thing ordinary form few writer repent put pen paper help produce 
21,"The chief amusement of the paper was contained in a ""New Code of Regulations for the Better Management of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles,"" from the editor's pen.  It began thus:",chief amusement paper contain new good pig editor pen begin

Take the ugliest, dirtiest, noisiest, and most ignorant specimen that can be found.  Lift it carefully with a pair of tongs into a bath full of vinegar.  Close the lid and let it remain there to soak for a week.  At the end of that time lift it out and scrape it well all over with a sharp substance, to get off the first coating of grime.  Soak again for another week and scrape again, and so on till the ninth or tenth coating is removed.  After that the creature will appear thinner than when it began.  Hang it up to dry in a clean place, and be sure no other Guinea-pigs or Tadpoles come near it.  Then put it in a clean gown, and quickly, before it can get at the ink, put it in a large glass bottle and fasten down the stopper.  Label it, `Specimen of a curious reptile formerly found at Saint Dominic's.  Now happily extinct.'""",immediate step take pickle specimen school museum follow recipe take ugliest dirtiest noisiest ignorant specimen find lift pair tong bath full vinegar close lid let remain soak week end time lift scrape sharp substance get first coating grime soak week scrape ninth tenth coating remove creature appear thin begin hang dry clean place sure other guinea pig tadpole come put clean gown get ink put large glass bottle fast stopper label specimen curious reptile find extinct 
36,"""There you are,"" said Paul, when, after much blundering and sticking at words, this remarkable paragraph had been read through.  ""There you are, Bramble, my boy; what do you think of that?""

37,"When, however, the row was over, the group had been joined by several of the elder boys, who appeared to appreciate Simon's poem, ""An Adventure outside the Dormitory Door.""  It was called an ""epick,"" and began thus. The reader must be contented with quite a short extract:--",row group join several elder boy appear appreciate poem call epick begin reader content short extract

39,"This last simile had evidently particularly delighted the poet.  So much so, that he brought it in at the close of every succeeding verse.  The ""epick"" went on, of course, to unravel the threads of the ""adventure,"" and to intimate pretty plainly who ""the youth"" referred to was.  To any one not interested in the poet or his epic the production was a dull one, and the moral at the end was not quite clear even to the most intellectual.",last simile delight poet bring close succeed verse epick go course unravel thread adventure intimate youth refer one interested poet epic production dull one moral end clear intellectual

41,"These were the only articles in the _Dominican_ that afforded any amusement.  The remainder of the paper, made up of the usual articles sneering at the Sixth and crowing over the school generally, were very tame.  The result of the Nightingale Scholarship was announced as follows:--",only article afford amusement remainder paper make usual article sneer crow school tame result announce follow

43,"This manner of announcing the unfortunate result was ingenious, and did Tony credit.  For, whether his object was to annoy the Sixth or to shield the Fifth, he succeeded amply in both.  There were some, however, in the Fifth who were by no means content that Greenfield should be let off so easily in the _Dominican_, and these read with interest the following ""Notes from Coventry,"" contributed by Bullinger.  Anthony had accepted and inserted them against his better judgment.",manner announce unfortunate result ingenious credit object annoy sixth shield fifth succeed be fifth means content let read interest follow contribute accept insert good judgment

His experiments are chiefly directed to the making or taking of examination papers, and on his return we may look for valuable discoveries.  Meanwhile he sees very little company.  The society in which he most delights is that of certain Guinea-pigs, between whom and himself a special bond of sympathy appears to exist.  It is a touching sight to see him taking his daily walks in company with these singular animals; who, be it said, seem to be the only creatures able to appreciate his character.  Curiously enough, since he left us, Saint Dominic's has not collapsed; indeed, it is a singular fact that now he is away it is no longer considered necessary for every fellow to lock his study-door when he goes out, and keep the key.""

49,"Miserable stuff indeed, as Stephen thought, but quite stinging enough to wound him over and over again as he saw the sneers and heard the laughs with which the reading of the extract was greeted.

But instead of this, the hardened villain turned quite cross when he saw his brother at the point of tears, and exclaimed, hurriedly, ""Don't make a young fool of yourself, Stee, whatever you do.  It won't do a bit of good.""",innocent natural thing cut exhibition feeling fall brother neck protest more do do thing suspect harden villain turn cross see brother point tear exclaim make young fool do do bit good
