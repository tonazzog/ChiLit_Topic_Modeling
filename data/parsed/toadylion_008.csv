1,CHAPTER VIII. THE FAMILIAR SPIRIT.,familiar 
2, Now there was a skeleton in the cupboard of General Napoleon Smith. No distinguished family can be respectable without at least one such. But that of the new field-marshal was particularly dark and disgraceful.,be skeleton cupboard distinguished family respectable least such new field marshal dark disgraceful 
3,"Very obediently Janet Sheepshanks vanished from the sick-room, and presently returned with an oblong parcel, which she handed to the hero of battles.",vanish sick room return oblong parcel hand hero battle 
4,"""Thank you,"" he said; ""are you sure that the children are out?""",thank say sure child 
5,"""They are sailing paper boats on the mill-dam,"" said Janet, going to the window to look.",sail paper boat mill dam say go window look 
6,Hugh John sighed a sigh. He wished he could sail boats on the mill-dam.,sigh sigh wish sail boat mill dam 
7,"""I hope every boat will go down the mill lade, and get mashed in the wheel,"" he said pleasantly.",hope boat go mill lade mash wheel say 
8,"""For shame, Master Hugh!"" replied Janet Sheepshanks, shaking her head at him, but conscious that he was exactly expressing her own mind, if she had been lying sick a-bed and had been compelled to listen to some other housekeeper jingling keys that once were hers, ransacking her sacredest repositories, and keeping in order the menials of the house.",shame reply shake head conscious express own mind lie sick bed compel listen other housekeeper jingling key ransack sacredest repository keep order menial house 
9,"Hugh John proceeded cautiously to unwrap his family skeleton. Presently from the folds of tissue paper a very aged and battered ""Sambo"" emerged. Now a ""Sambo"" is a black woolly-haired negro doll of the fashion of many years ago. This specimen was dressed in simple and airy fashion in a single red shell jacket. As to the rest, he was bare and black from head to foot. Janet called him ""that horrid object""; but, nevertheless, he was precious in the eyes of Hugh John, and therefore in hers.",proceed unwrap family skeleton fold tissue paper aged batter sambo emerge black woolly hair negro doll fashion many year specimen dress simple airy fashion single red shell jacket rest bare black head foot call horrid object precious eye 
10,"Though twelve years of age, he still liked to carry on dark and covert intercourse with his ancient ""Sambo."" In public, indeed, he preached, in season and out of season, against the folly and wickedness of dolls. No one but a lassie or a ""lassie-boy"" would do such a thing. He laughed at Priscilla for cleaning up her doll's kitchen once a week, and for organising afternoon tea-parties for her quiet harem. But secretly he would have liked very well to see Sambo sit at that bounteous board.",year age like carry dark covert intercourse ancient public preach season season folly wickedness doll lassie lassie boy do thing laugh clean doll kitchen week organise afternoon tea- party quiet harem like see sit bounteous board 
11,"Nevertheless, he instructed Toady Lion every day with doctrine and reproof that it was ""only for girls"" to have dolls. And knowing well that none of his common repositories were so remote and sacred as long to escape Priscilla's unsleeping eye, or the more stormy though fitful curiosity of Sir Toady Lion, Hugh John had been compelled to take his ancient nurse and ever faithful friend Janet into his confidence. So Sambo dwelt in the housekeeper's pantry and had two distinct odours. One side of him smelt of paraffin, and the other of soft soap, which, to a skilled detective, might have revealed the secret of his dark abode.",instruct day doctrine reproof girl have doll know common repository remote sacred escape unsleeping eye stormy fitful curiosity compel take ancient nurse faithful friend confidence dwele housekeeper pantry have distinct odour side smell paraffin other soft soap skilled detective reveal secret dark abode 
12,But let us not do our hero an injustice.,let do hero injustice 
13,"It was not exactly as a doll that General Smith considered Sambo. By no means so, indeed. Sometimes he was a distinguished general who came to take orders from his chief, sometimes an awkward private who needed to be drilled, and then knocked spinning across the floor for inattention to orders. For, be it remembered, it was the custom in the army of Field-Marshal-General Smith for the Commander-in-Chief to drill the recruits with his own voice, and in the by no means improbable event of their proving stupid, to knock them endwise with his own august hand.",doll consider means distinguished general come take order chief awkward private need drill knock spinn floor inattention order remember custom army drill recruit own voice means improbable event prove stupid knock own august hand 
14,"But it was as Familiar Spirit, and in the pursuit of occult divination, that General Napoleon most frequently resorted to Sambo. He had read all he could find in legend and history concerning that gruesomely attractive goblin, clothed all in red, which the wicked Lord Soulis kept in an oaken chest in a castle not so far from his own father's house of Windy Standard.",familiar pursuit occult divination resort read find legend history concern attractive goblin cloth red wicked keep oaken chest castle own father house windy 
15,"And Hugh John saw no reason why Sambo should not be the very one. Spirits do not die. It is a known fact that they are fond of their former haunts. What, then, could be clearer? Sambo was evidently Lord Soulis' Red Imp risen from the dead. Was Sambo not black? The devil was black. Did Sambo not wear a red coat? Was not the demon of the oaken chest attired in flaming scarlet, when all cautiously he lifted the lid at midnight and looked wickedly out upon his master?",see reason very one spirit die know fact fond former haunt clear red rise dead black black wear red coat demon oaken chest attire flame scarlet lift lid midnight look master 
16,"Yet the General was conscious that Sambo Soulis was a distinct disappointment in the part of familiar spirit. He would sit silent, with his head hanging idiotically on one side, when he was asked to reveal the deepest secrets of the future, instead of toeing the line and doing it. Nor was it recorded in the chronicles of Soulis that the original demon of the chest had had his nose ""bashed flat"" by his master, as Hugh John vigorously expressed the damaged appearance of his own familiar.",conscious distinct disappointment part familiar spirit sit silent head hang side ask reveal deep secret future toe line do record chronicle original demon chest have nose bash flat master express damage appearance own familiar 
17,"Worse than all, Hugh John had tried to keep Sambo in his rabbit-box. But not only did he utterly fail to put his ""fearful head, crowned with a red night-cap"" over the edge of the hutch at the proper time--as, had he been of respectable parentage, he would not have failed to do, but, in addition, he developed in his close quarters an animal odour so pungent and unprofitable that Janet Sheepshanks refused to admit him into the store-cupboard till he had been thoroughly fumigated and disinfected. So for a whole week Sambo Soulis swung ignominiously by the neck from the clothes line, and Hugh John went about in fear of the questioning of the children or of the confiscation by his father of his well-beloved but somewhat unsatisfactory familiar spirit.",bad try keep rabbit box fail put fearful head crown red night cap edge hutch proper time respectable parentage fail do addition develop close quarter animal odour pungent unprofitable refuse admit store cupboard fumigate disinfect whole week swing neck clothes line go fear question child confiscation father beloved unsatisfactory familiar spirit 
18,It was in order to consult him on a critical point of doctrine and practice that Hugh John had now sent for Sambo Soulis.,order consult critical point doctrine practice send 
19,"He propped him up before him against a pillow, on which he sat bent forward at an acute angle from the hips, as if ready to pounce upon his master and rend him to pieces so soon as the catechism should be over.",proppe pillow sit bend acute angle hip ready pounce master rend piece catechism 
20,"""Look here,"" said General-Field-Marshal Smith to the oracle, ""supposing the governor tells me to split on Nipper Donnan, the butcher boy, will it be dasht-mean if I do?""",look say oracle suppose governor tell split butcher boy dasht mean do 
21,"Sambo Soulis, being disturbed by the delicacy of the question or perhaps by the wriggling of Hugh John upon his pillow, only lurched drivellingly forward.",disturb delicacy question wriggling pillow lurch 
22,"""Sit up and answer,"" cried his master, ""or else I'll hike you out of that pretty quick, for a silly old owl!""",sit answer cry master else hike quick silly old owl 
23,"And with his least bandaged hand he gave Sambo a sound cuff on the side of his venerable battered head, before propping him up at a new angle with his chin on his knees.",least bandage hand give sound cuff side venerable batter head prop new angle chin knee 
24,"""Now speak up, Soulis,"" said General Smith; ""I ask you would it be dasht-mean?""",speak say ask dasht mean 
25,The oracle was understood to joggle his chin and goggle his eyes. He certainly did the latter.,oracle understand joggle chin goggle eye do latter 
26,"""I thought so,"" said Soulis' master, as is usual in such cases, interpreting the reply oracular according to his liking. ""But look here, how are we to get back Donald unless we split? Would it not be all right to split just to get Donald back?""",think say master usual such case interpret reply oracular accord like look get split right split get 
27,Sambo Soulis waggled his head again. This time his master looked a little more serious.,waggle head time master look little serious 
28,"""I suppose you are right,"" he said pensively, ""but if it would be dasht-mean to split, we must just try to get him back ourselves--that is, if the beasts have not cut his throat, as they said they would.""",suppose right say dasht mean split try get beast cut throat say
