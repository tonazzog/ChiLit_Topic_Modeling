2," Jack's ingenuity--We get into difficulties about fishing, and get out of them by a method which gives us a cold bath--Horrible encounter with a shark.",ingenuity get difficulty fishing get method give cold bath horrible encounter shark 
3,"For several days after the excursion related in the last chapter we did not wander far from our encampment, but gave ourselves up to forming plans for the future and making our present abode comfortable.",several day excursion related last chapter wander encampment give form plan future make present abode comfortable 
4,"There were various causes that induced this state of comparative inaction.  In the first place, although everything around us was so delightful, and we could without difficulty obtain all that we required for our bodily comfort, we did not quite like the idea of settling down here for the rest of our lives, far away from our friends and our native land.  To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence seemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and friends for ever, that we tacitly shrank from it and put off our preparations, for one reason and another, as long as we could.  Then there was a little uncertainty still as to there being natives on the island, and we entertained a kind of faint hope that a ship might come and take us off. But as day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we gave up all hope of an early deliverance and set diligently to work at our homestead.",be various cause induce state comparative inaction first place delightful difficulty obtain require bodily comfort like idea settle rest life friend native land set preparation permanent residence seem make mind say adieu home friend shrank put preparation reason be little uncertainty native island entertain kind faint hope ship come take day day pass savage ship appear give hope early deliverance set work homestead 
5,"During this time, however, we had not been altogether idle.  We made several experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut, most of which did not improve it.  Then we removed our goods, and took up our abode in the cave, but found the change so bad that we returned gladly to the bower. Besides this we bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal; at least Jack and Peterkin did,--I listened.  Among other useful things, Jack, who was ever the most active and diligent, converted about three inches of the hoop-iron into an excellent knife.  First he beat it quite flat with the axe.  Then he made a rude handle, and tied the hoop-iron to it with our piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on a piece of sand-stone.  When it was finished he used it to shape a better handle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton handkerchief;--in which operation he had, as Peterkin pointed out, torn off one of Lord Nelson's noses.  However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by Peterkin as a fishing line.  He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end of it.  This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they were pulled quickly ashore.  But as the line was very short and we had no boat, the fish we caught were exceedingly small.",time idle make several experiment cook cocoa nut most improve remove goods take abode cave find change bad return bower bath talk great deal least listen other useful thing active diligent convert inch hoop iron excellent knife beat flat axe make rude handle tie hoop iron piece whip cord ground edge piece sand stone finish use shape good handle fix strip cotton handkerchief operation have point tear nose whip cord set free use fishing line tie piece oyster end fish allow swallow pull line short have boat fish catch small 
6,"One day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been angling, and said in a very cross tone, ""I'll tell you what, Jack, I'm not going to be humbugged with catching such contemptible things any longer.  I want you to swim out with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!""",day come beach angle say cross tone tell go humbugg catching such contemptible thing want swim back let fish deep water 
7,"""Dear me, Peterkin,"" replied Jack, ""I had no idea you were taking the thing so much to heart, else I would have got you out of that difficulty long ago.  Let me see,""--and Jack looked down at a piece of timber on which he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction, which he always assumed when trying to invent or discover anything.",reply have idea take thing much heart else get difficulty let see look piece timber labour peculiar gaze abstraction assume try invent discover 
8,"""What say you to building a boat?"" he inquired, looking up hastily.",say build boat inquire look 
9,"""Take far too long,"" was the reply; ""can't be bothered waiting.  I want to begin at once!""",take reply bother wait want begin 
10,"Again Jack considered.  ""I have it!"" he cried.  ""We'll fell a large tree and launch the trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish you've nothing to do but to swim out to it.""",consider have cry fall large tree launch trunk water want fish have do swim 
11,"""Would not a small raft do better?"" said I.",small raft do good say 
12,"""Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together with.  Perhaps we may find something hereafter that will do as well, but, in the meantime, let us try the tree.""",good have rope bind find do meantime let try tree 
13,"This was agreed on, so we started off to a spot not far distant, where we knew of a tree that would suit us, which grew near the water's edge.  As soon as we reached it Jack threw off his coat, and, wielding the axe with his sturdy arms, hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without stopping.  Then he paused, and, while he sat down to rest, I continued the work.  Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on it, so that when Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes cutting brought it down with a terrible crash.",agree start spot distant know tree suit grow water edge reach throw coat wield axe sturdy arm hack hew quarter hour stop pause sit rest continue work make vigorous attack renew powerful blow few minute cutting bring terrible crash 
14,"""Hurrah! now for it,"" cried Jack; ""let us off with its head.""",cry let head 
15,"So saying he began to cut through the stem again, at about six yards from the thick end.  This done, he cut three strong, short poles or levers from the stout branches, with which to roll the log down the beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two feet thick at the large end, we could not move it without such helps.  With the levers, however, we rolled it slowly into the sea.",say begin cut stem yard thick end do cut strong short pole lever stout branch roll log beach sea foot thick large end move such help lever roll sea 
16,"Having been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next shaped the levers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted to embark.  This was easy enough to do; but, after seating ourselves astride the log, it was with the utmost difficulty we kept it from rolling round and plunging us into the water.  Not that we minded that much; but we preferred, if possible, to fish in dry clothes.  To be sure, our trousers were necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on each side of the log; but, as they could be easily dried, we did not care.  After half an hour's practice, we became expert enough to keep our balance pretty steadily.  Then Peterkin laid down his paddle, and having baited his line with a whole oyster, dropt it into deep water.",successful launch vessel shape lever rude oar paddle attempt embark easy do seating log utmost difficulty keep roll plung water minded much prefer possible fish dry clothes sure trousers wet leg dangle water side log dry care hour practice become expert keep balance lay paddle bait line whole oyster dript deep water 
17,"""Now, then, Jack,"" said he, ""be cautious; steer clear o' that sea-weed. There; that's it; gently, now, gently.  I see a fellow at least a foot long down there, coming to--ha! that's it!  Oh! bother, he's off.""",say cautious steer clear sea weed see fellow least foot come bother 
18,"""Did he bite?"" said Jack, urging the log onwards a little with his paddle.",bite say urge log little paddle 
19,"""Bite? ay!  He took it into his mouth, but the moment I began to haul he opened his jaws and let it out again.""",bite take mouth moment begin haul open jaw let 
20,"""Let him swallow it next time,"" said Jack, laughing at the melancholy expression of Peterkin's visage.",let swallow next time say laugh melancholy expression visage 
21,"""There he's again,"" cried Peterkin, his eyes flashing with excitement. ""Look out!  Now then!  No!  Yes!  No!  Why, the brute _won't_ swallow it!""",cry eye flash excitement look brute _wo swallow 
22,"""Try to haul him up by the mouth, then,"" cried Jack.  ""Do it gently.""",try haul mouth cry do 
23,A heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor Peterkin had tried and failed again.,heavy sigh look blank despair show poor try fail 
24,"""Never mind, lad,"" said Jack, in a voice of sympathy; ""we'll move on, and offer it to some other fish.""  So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but scarcely had he moved from the spot, when a fish with an enormous head and a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at once.",mind say voice sympathy move offer other fish say ply paddle move spot fish enormous head little body dart rock swallow bait 
25,"""Got him this time,--that's a fact!"" cried Peterkin, hauling in the line. ""He's swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare.  Oh what a thumper!""",get time fact cry haul line swallow bait tail declare thumper 
26,"As the fish came struggling to the surface, we leaned forward to see it, and overbalanced the log.  Peterkin threw his arms round the fish's neck; and, in another instant, we were all floundering in the water!",fish come struggle surface learn see overbalance log throw arm fish neck instant flounder water 
27,"A shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface like three drowned rats, and seized hold of the log.  We soon recovered our position, and sat more warily, while Peterkin secured the fish, which had well-nigh escaped in the midst of our struggles.  It was little worth having, however; but, as Peterkin remarked, it was better than the smouts he had been catching for the last two or three days; so we laid it on the log before us, and having re-baited the line, dropt it in again for another.",shout laughter burst rise surface drown rat seize hold log recover position sit secure fish have nigh escape midst struggle little worth have remark good smout catching last day lay log re-bait line dript 
28,"Now, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention was suddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards away from us.  Peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that direction, as he thought it was a big fish, and we might have a chance of catching it.  But Jack, instead of complying, said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I never before heard him use,--",intent sport attention attract ripple sea few yard shout paddle direction think big fish have chance catching comply say deep earnest tone voice hear use 
29,"""Haul up your line, Peterkin; seize your paddle; quick,--it's a shark!""",haul line seize paddle quick shark 
30,"The horror with which we heard this may well be imagined, for it must be remembered that our legs were hanging down in the water, and we could not venture to pull them up without upsetting the log.  Peterkin instantly hauled up the line; and, grasping his paddle, exerted himself to the utmost, while we also did our best to make for shore.  But we were a good way off, and the log being, as I have before said, very heavy, moved but slowly through the water.  We now saw the shark quite distinctly swimming round and round us, its sharp fin every now and then protruding above the water.  From its active and unsteady motions, Jack knew it was making up its mind to attack us, so he urged us vehemently to paddle for our lives, while he himself set us the example.  Suddenly he shouted ""Look out!--there he comes!"" and in a second we saw the monstrous fish dive close under us, and turn half over on his side.  But we all made a great commotion with our paddles, which no doubt frightened it away for that time, as we saw it immediately after circling round us as before.",horror hear imagine remember leg hang water venture pull upsetting log haul line grasp paddle exert utmost do good make shore good way log say heavy move water see shark swim sharp fin protrude water active unsteady motion know make mind attack urge paddle life set example shout look come second see monstrous fish dive close turn half side make great commotion paddle frighten time see circle 
31,"""Throw the fish to him,"" cried Jack, in a quick, suppressed voice; ""we'll make the shore in time yet if we can keep him off for a few minutes.""",throw fish cry quick suppress voice make shore time keep few minute 
32,"Peterkin stopped one instant to obey the command, and then plied his paddle again with all his might.  No sooner had the fish fallen on the water than we observed the shark to sink.  In another second we saw its white breast rising; for sharks always turn over on their sides when about to seize their prey, their mouths being not at the point of their heads like those of other fish, but, as it were, under their chins.  In another moment his snout rose above the water,--his wide jaws, armed with a terrific double row of teeth, appeared.  The dead fish was engulfed, and the shark sank out of sight.  But Jack was mistaken in supposing that it would be satisfied.  In a very few minutes it returned to us, and its quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.",stop instant obey command ply paddle have fish fall water observe shark sink second see white breast rising shark turn side seize prey mouth point head other fish chin moment snout rise water wide jaw armed terrific double row tooth appear dead fish engulf shark sink sight mistaken suppose satisfy few minute return quick motion lead fear attack 
33,"""Stop paddling,"" cried Jack suddenly.  ""I see it coming up behind us. Now, obey my orders quickly.  Our lives may depend on it Ralph.  Peterkin, do your best to _balance the log_.  Don't look out for the shark.  Don't glance behind you.  Do nothing but balance the log.""",stop paddle cry see come obey order life depend do good _balance log_ look shark glance do balance log 
34,{A dreadful adventure: p77.jpg},dreadful adventure p77.jpg 
35,"Peterkin and I instantly did as we were ordered, being only too glad to do anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of escape, for we had implicit confidence in Jack's courage and wisdom.  For a few seconds, that seemed long minutes to my mind, we sat thus silently; but I could not resist glancing backward, despite the orders to the contrary.  On doing so, I saw Jack sitting rigid like a statue, with his paddle raised, his lips compressed, and his eye-brows bent over his eyes, which glared savagely from beneath them down into the water.  I also saw the shark, to my horror, quite close under the log, in the act of darting towards Jack's foot.  I could scarce suppress a cry on beholding this.  In another moment the shark rose.  Jack drew his leg suddenly from the water, and threw it over the log.  The monster's snout rubbed against the log as it passed, and revealed its hideous jaws, into which Jack instantly plunged the paddle, and thrust it down its throat.  So violent was the act that Jack rose to his feet in performing it; the log was thereby rolled completely over, and we were once more plunged into the water.  We all rose, spluttering and gasping, in a moment.",do order glad do afford chance hope escape have implicit confidence courage wisdom few second seem long minute mind sit resist glance order contrary do see sit rigid statue paddle raise lip compress eye brow bend eye glare water see shark horror close log act dart foot suppress cry behold moment shark rise draw leg water throw log monster snout rub log pass reveal hideous jaw plunge paddle thrust throat violent act rise foot perform log roll plunge water rise splutter gasp moment 
36,"""Now then, strike out for shore,"" cried Jack.  ""Here, Peterkin, catch hold of my collar, and kick out with a will.""",strike shore cry catch hold collar kick will 
37,"Peterkin did as he was desired, and Jack struck out with such force that he cut through the water like a boat; while I, being free from all encumbrance, succeeded in keeping up with him.  As we had by this time drawn pretty near to the shore, a few minutes more sufficed to carry us into shallow water; and, finally, we landed in safety, though very much exhausted, and not a little frightened by our terrible adventure.",desire strike such force cut water boat free encumbrance succeed keep have time draw shore few minute suffice carry shallow water land safety exhausted little frighten terrible adventure
