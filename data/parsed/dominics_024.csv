2,"An earthquake could hardly have produced a greater shock than Oliver's strange conduct produced on the Fifth Form at Saint Dominic's.  For a moment or two they remained almost stupefied with astonishment, and then rose a sudden clamour of tongues on every hand.",earthquake produce great shock strange conduct produce fifth moment remain stupefy astonishment rise sudden clamour tongue hand

16,"Pembury vouchsafed no answer, but whistled to himself.",vouchsafe answer whistle

18,"""I don't believe a word that ass says.""",believe word ass say 
19,"""Oh, but,"" began Simon, with a most aggravating cheerfulness, ""I assure you I'm not telling a lie, Wraysford.  I'm sorry I said anything about it.  I never thought there would be a row about it.  I promise I'll not mention it to anybody.""",begin aggravating cheerfulness assure tell lie sorry say think be row promise mention

21,"""Well, I know I met Greenfield senior coming out of the Doctor's study on Saturday evening, about five minutes past nine.  I'm positive of that,"" said Simon.",know meet senior come study evening minute positive say 
22,"""And I suppose he had the paper in his hand?"" sneered Wraysford, looking very miserable.",suppose have paper hand sneer look miserable 
23,"""No; I expect he'd put it in his pocket, you know, at least, that is, I would have.""",expect put pocket know least have 
24,"This candid admission on the part of the ingenious poet was too much for the gravity of one or two of the Fifth.  Wraysford, however, was in no laughing mood, and went off to his study in great perturbation.",candid admission part ingenious poet much gravity fifth laugh mood go study great perturbation 
25,"He could not for a moment believe that his friend could be guilty of such a dishonourable act as stealing an examination paper, and his impulse was to go at once to Oliver's study and get the suspicions of the Fifth laid there and then.  But the fear of seeming in the least degree to join in those suspicions kept him back.  He tried to laugh the thing to scorn inwardly, and called himself a villain and a traitor twenty times for admitting even the shadow of a doubt into his own mind. Yet, as Wraysford sat that afternoon and brooded over his friend's new trouble, he became more and more uncomfortable.",moment believe friend guilty dishonourable act steal examination paper impulse go study get suspicion fifth lay fear seem least degree join suspicion keep try laugh thing scorn call villain traitor time admit shadow doubt own mind sit afternoon brood friend new trouble become uncomfortable 
26,"When on a former occasion the fellows had called in question Oliver's courage, he had felt so sure, so very sure the suspicion was a groundless one, that he had never taken it seriously to heart.  But somehow this affair was quite different.  What possible object would Simon, for instance, have for telling a deliberate lie? and if it had been a lie, why should Oliver have betrayed such confusion on hearing it?",former occasion fellow call question courage feel sure sure suspicion groundless one take heart affair different possible object instance have tell deliberate lie lie betray such confusion hear 
27,"These were questions which, try all he would, Wraysford could not get out of his mind.",question try get mind 
28,"When Stephen presently came in, cheery as ever, and eager to hear how the examination had gone off, the elder boy felt an awkwardness in talking to him which he had never experienced before.  As for Stephen, he put down the short, embarrassed answers he received to Wraysford's own uneasiness as to the result of the examination.  Little guessed the boy what was passing in the other's mind!",come cheery eager hear examination go elder boy feel awkwardness talk experience put short embarrass answer receive own uneasiness result examination little guess boy pass other mind 
29,"There was just one hope Wraysford clung to.  That was that Oliver should come out anywhere but first in the result.  If Loman, or Wraysford himself, were to win, no one would be able to say his friend had profited by a dishonourable act; indeed, it would be as good as proof he had not taken the paper.",be hope cling come result win able say friend profit dishonourable act good proof take paper 
30,"And yet Wraysford felt quite sick as he called to mind the unflagging manner in which Oliver had worked at his paper that morning, covering sheet upon sheet with his answers, and scarcely drawing in until time was up.  It didn't look like losing, this.",feel sick call mind unflagging manner work paper morning cover sheet sheet answer draw time look lose 
31,"He threw himself back in his chair in sheer misery.  ""I would sooner have done the thing myself,"" groaned he to himself, ""than Oliver.""  Then suddenly he added, ""But it's not true!  I'm certain of it!  He couldn't do it!  I'll never believe it of him!""",throw chair sheer misery do thing groan add true certain do believe

35,"""No, I don't,"" replied Wraysford, but so sadly and hesitatingly that had he at once confessed he did, he could not have expressed his meaning more plainly.",reply confess express meaning 
36,"""I'd give anything to be sure it was all false,"" said Pembury, ""and so would a lot of the fellows.  As for that fool Simon--""",give sure false say lot fellow fool 
37,"""Bah!"" exclaimed Wraysford, fiercely, ""the fellow ought to be kicked round the school.""",exclaim fellow kick school 
38,"""He's getting on that way already, I fancy,"" said Pembury.  ""I was saying I'd think nothing at all about it if what he says was the only thing to go by, but--well, you saw what a state Greenfield got into about it?""",get way fancy say say think say only thing go see state get 
39,"""Maybe he was just in a sudden rage with the fellow for thinking of such a thing,"" said Wraysford.",sudden rage fellow think thing say 
40,"""It looked like something more than rage,"" said Pembury, dismally, ""something a good deal more.""",look more rage say good deal 
41,"Wraysford said nothing, but fidgeted in his chair.  A long silence followed, each busy with his own thoughts and both yearning for any sign of hope.  ""I don't see what good it could have done him if he did take the paper.  He'd have no time to cram it up yesterday.  He was out with you, wasn't he, all the afternoon?""",say fidget chair long silence follow busy own thought yearn sign hope see good do take paper have time cram yesterday afternoon

58,"""Oh, yes; but of course he didn't tell me--not likely.  But I say, I suppose we're sure to win the Nightingale now, aren't we?  Mind, I'm not going to tell anybody, because, of course, it's a secret.""",course tell likely say suppose sure win mind go tell course secret

62,"The wretched Simon gave up further attempts to explain himself.  Still what he had said, in his blundering way, had been quite enough.",wretch give further attempt explain say blunder way enough 
63,"The thing was beyond a doubt; and as the Fifth sat there in judgment, a sense of shame and humiliation came over them, to which many of them were unused.",thing doubt fifth sit judgment sense shame humiliation come many unused 
64,"""I know this,"" said Ricketts, giving utterance to what was passing in the minds of nearly all his class-fellows, ""I'd sooner have lost the scholarship twenty times over than win it like this.""",know say give utterance pass mind class fellow lose scholarship time win

73,"One or two laughed at this, but to most of those present the matter was past a joke.",laugh most present matter joke 
74,"For it must be said of the Dominicans--and I think it may be said of a good many English public schoolboys besides--that, however foolish they may have been in other respects, however riotous, however jealous of one another, however well satisfied with themselves, a point of honour was a point which they all took seriously to heart.  They could forgive a schoolfellow for doing a disobedient act sometimes, or perhaps even a vicious act, but a cowardly or dishonourable action was a thing which nothing would excuse, and which they felt not only a disgrace to the boy perpetrating it, but a disgrace put upon themselves.",say think say good many english public schoolboy foolish other respect riotous jealous satisfied point honour point take heart forgive schoolfellow do disobedient act vicious act cowardly dishonourable action thing excuse feel disgrace boy perpetrate disgrace put 
75,"Had Oliver been the most popular boy in the school it would have been all the same.  As it was, he was a long way from being the most popular. He never took any pains to win the good opinion of his fellows.  When, by means of some achievement in which he excelled, he had contrived (as in the case of the cricket match last term) to bring glory on his school and to make himself a hero in the eyes of Saint Dominic's, he had been wont to take the applause bestowed on him with the utmost indifference, which some might even construe into contempt.  And in precisely the same spirit would he take the displeasure which he now and then managed to incur.",popular boy school same long way popular take pain win good opinion fellow means achievement excell contrive case cricket match last term bring glory school make hero eye wont take applause bestow utmost indifference construe contempt same spirit take displeasure manage incur 
76,"Boys don't like this.  It irritates them to see their praise or blame made little of; and for this reason, if for no other, Oliver would hardly have been a favourite.",boy like irritate see praise blame make little reason other favourite 
77,"But there was another reason.  Now that the Fifth found their faith in Greenfield senior rudely dashed to the ground, they were not slow to recall the unpleasant incidents of last term, when, by refusing to thrash Loman, he had discredited the whole Form, and laid himself under the suspicion of cowardice.",be reason fifth find faith senior dash ground slow recall unpleasant incident last term refuse thrash discredite whole form lay suspicion cowardice 
78,"Most of the fellows had at the time of the Nightingale examination either forgotten, or forgiven, or repented of their suspicions, and, indeed, by his challenge to Loman the previous Saturday Oliver had been considered quite to have redeemed his reputation in this respect.  But now it all came up again.  A fellow who could do a cowardly deed at one time could do a mean one at another.  If one was natural to his character, so was the other, and in fact one explained the other.  He was mean when he showed himself a coward last term.  He was a coward when he did a mean act this term.",most fellow have time examination forget forgive repent suspicion challenge previous consider redeem reputation respect come fellow do cowardly deed time do mean one natural character other fact explain other mean show coward last term coward do mean act term 
79,"What wonder, in these circumstances, if the Fifth felt sore, very sore indeed, on the subject of Oliver Greenfield?",wonder circumstance fifth feel sore sore subject 
80,"To every one's relief, he did not put in an appearance again that day. He kept his study, and Paul brought down word at prayer time that he had a headache and had gone to bed.",one relief put appearance day keep study bring word prayer time have headache go bed 
81,At this the Fifth smiled grimly and said nothing.,fifth smile say 
82,"Next morning, however, Oliver turned up as usual in his place.  He looked pale, but otherwise unconcerned, and those who looked-for traces of shame and self-abasement in his face were sorely disappointed.",next morning turn usual place look pale unconcerned look trace shame self abasement face disappointed 
83,He surely must have known or guessed the resolution the Fifth had come to with regard to him; but from his unabashed manner he was evidently determined not to take it for granted till the hint should be given pretty clearly.,know guess resolution fifth come regard unabashed manner determine take grant hint give 
84,"On Ricketts, whose desk was next to that of Oliver, fell the task of first giving this hint.",desk fall task give hint 
85,"""How did you get on yesterday in the English Literature?"" asked Oliver.",get yesterday english ask 
86,Ricketts' only answer was to turn his back and begin to talk to his other neighbour.,only answer turn back begin talk other neighbour 
87,Those who were watching this incident noticed a sudden flush on Oliver's cheek as he stared for an instant at his late friend.  Then with an effort he seemed to recover himself.,watch incident notice sudden flush cheek stare instant late friend effort seem recover 
88,"He did not, however, attempt any further conversation either with Ricketts or his other neighbour, Braddy, who in a most marked manner had moved as far as possible away from him.  On the contrary, he coolly availed himself of the extra room on the desk and busied himself silently with the lessons for the day.",attempt further conversation other neighbour mark manner move possible contrary avail extra room desk busy lesson day 
89,"But he now and then looked furtively up in the direction of Wraysford, who was seated at an opposite desk.  The eyes of the two friends met now and then, and when they did each seemed greatly embarrassed.  For Wraysford, after a night's heart-searching, had come to the determination not, after all, to cut his friend; and yet he found it impossible to feel and behave towards him as formerly.  He tried very hard indeed not to appear constrained, but the more he tried the more embarrassed he felt.  After class he purposely walked across the room to meet his old chum.",look direction seat opposite desk eye friend meet seem embarrass night heart searching come determination cut friend find impossible feel behave try appear constrain more try embarrass feel class walk room meet old chum 
90,"""How are you?"" he said, in a forced tone and manner utterly unlike his old self.",say force tone manner old self 
91,"It was a ridiculous and feeble remark to make, and it would have been far better had he said nothing.  Oliver stared at him for a moment in a perplexed way, and then, without answering the question, walked somewhere else.",ridiculous feeble remark make good say stare moment perplexed way answer question walk else 
92,"Wraysford was quite conscious of his own mistake; still it hurt him sorely that his well-meant effort, which had cost him so much, should be thus summarily thrust aside without a word.  For the first time in his life he felt a sense of resentment against his old friend, the beginning of a gap which was destined to become wider as time went on.",conscious own mistake hurt mean effort cost much thrust word first time life feel sense resentment old friend beginning gap destine become wide time go 
93,"The only person in the room who did meet Oliver on natural ground was the poetic Simon.  To him Oliver walked up and said, quietly, ""I beg your pardon for hitting you yesterday.""",only person room meet natural ground poetic walk say beg pardon hit yesterday 
94,"""Oh,"" said Simon, with a giggle.  ""Oh, it's all right, Greenfield, you know; I never meant to let it out.  It'll soon get hushed up; I don't intend to let it go a bit farther.""",say giggle right know mean let hush intend let go bit 
95,"The poet was too much carried away by the enthusiasm of his own magnanimity to observe that he was in imminent risk, during the delivery of this speech, of another blow a good deal more startling than that of yesterday.  When he concluded, he found Oliver had left him to himself and hurriedly quitted the room.",poet carry enthusiasm own magnanimity observe imminent risk delivery speech blow good deal startling yesterday conclude find leave quit room
