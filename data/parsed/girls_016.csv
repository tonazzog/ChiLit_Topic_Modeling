2,"The short evening service was over, and one by one, in orderly procession, the girls left the chapel.  Annie was about to rise to her feet to follow her school-companions, when Mrs Willis stooped down and whispered something in her ear.  Her face became instantly suffused with a dull red; she resumed her seat, and buried her face in both her hands. One or two of the girls noticed her despondent attitude as they left the chapel, and Cecil Temple looked back with a glance of such unutterable sympathy that Annie's proud, suffering little heart would have been touched could she but have seen the look.",short evening service orderly procession girl leave chapel about rise foot follow school companion stoop whisper ear face become suffuse dull red resume seat bury face hand girl notice despondent attitude leave chapel look glance such unutterable sympathy proud suffer little heart touch see look 
3,"Presently the young steps died away, and Annie, raising her head, saw that she was alone with Mr Everard, who seated himself in the place which Mrs Willis had occupied by her side.",young step die raise head see alone seat place occupy side 
4,"""Your governess has asked me to speak to you, my dear,"" he said, in his kind and fatherly tones; ""she wants us to discuss this thing which is making you so unhappy quite fully together.""  Here the clergyman paused, and, noticing a sudden wistful and soft look in the girl's brown eyes, he continued: ""Perhaps, however, you have something to say to me which will throw light on this mystery?""",governess ask speak dear say kind fatherly tone want discuss thing make unhappy clergyman pause notice sudden wistful soft look girl brown eye continue have say throw light mystery 
5,"""No, sir, I have nothing to say,"" replied Annie, and now again the sullen expression passed like a wave over her face.",sir have say reply sullen expression pass wave face 
6,"""Poor child,"" said Mr Everard.  ""Perhaps, Annie,"" he continued, ""you do not quite understand me--you do not quite read my motive in talking to you to-night.  I am not here in any sense to reprove you.  You are either guilty of this sin, or you are not guilty.  In either case I pity you; it is very hard, very bitter, to be falsely accused--I pity you much if this is the case; but it is still harder, Annie, still more bitter, still more absolutely crushing to be accused of a sin which we are trying to conceal.  In that terrible case God Himself hides His face.  Poor child, poor child, I pity you most of all if you are guilty.""",poor child say continue understand read motive talk night sense reprove guilty sin guilty case pity hard bitter accuse pity much case hard bitter crush accuse sin try conceal terrible case hide face poor child poor child pity most guilty 
7,"Annie had again covered her face, and bowed her head over her hands. She did not speak for a moment, but presently Mr Everard heard a low sob, and then another, and another, until at last her whole frame was shaken with a perfect tempest of weeping.",cover face bow head hand speak moment hear low sob last whole frame shake perfect tempest weeping 
8,"The old clergyman, who had seen many strange phases of human nature, who had in his day comforted and guided more than one young school-girl, was far too wise to do anything to check this flow of grief.  He knew Annie would speak more fully and more frankly when her tears were over.  He was right.  She presently raised a very tear-stained face to the clergyman.",old clergyman see many strange phase human nature have day comfort guide more young school girl wise do check flow grief know speak tear right raise tear stain face clergyman 
9,"""I felt very bitter at your coming to speak to me,"" she began.  ""Mrs Willis has always sent for you when everything else has failed with us girls, and I did not think she would treat me so.  I was determined not to say anything to you.  Now, however, you have spoken good words to me, and I can't turn away from you.  I will tell you all that is in my heart.  I will promise before God to conceal nothing, if only you will do one thing for me.""",feel bitter come speak begin send else fail girl think treat determined say speak good word turn tell heart promise conceal do thing

16,"""This is the truth before God,"" she said, as she locked her two hands together and raised her eyes freely and unshrinkingly to Mr Everard's face.",truth say lock hand raise eye face 
17,"""I have always loved Mrs Willis.  I have reasons for loving her which the girls don't know about.  The girls don't know that when my mother was dying she gave me into Mrs Willis's charge, and she said, `You must keep Annie until her father comes back.'  Mother did not know where father was; but she said he would be sure to come back some day, and look for mother and me: and Mrs Willis said she would keep me faithfully until father came to claim me.  That is four years ago, and my father has never come, nor have I heard of him, and I think, I am almost sure, that the little money which mother left must be all used up.  Mrs Willis never says anything about money, and she did not wish me to tell my story to the girls.  None of them know except Cecil Temple.  I am sure some day father will come home, and he will give Mrs Willis back the money she has spent on me; but never, never, never can he repay her for her goodness to me.  You see I cannot help loving Mrs Willis.  It is quite impossible for any girl to have such a friend and not to love her.  I know I am very wild, and that I do all sorts of mad things.  It seems to me that I cannot help myself sometimes: but I would not willingly, indeed, I would not willingly hurt anybody.  Last Wednesday, as you know, there was a great disturbance in the school. Dora Russell's desk was tampered with, and so was Cecil Temple's.  You know, of course, what was found in both the desks.  Mrs Willis sent for me, and asked me about the caricature which was drawn in Cecil's book. I looked at it and I told her the truth.  I did not conceal one thing. I told her the whole truth as far as I knew it.  She did not believe me. She said so.  What more could I do then?""",love have reason love girl know girl know mother die give charge say keep father come mother know father say sure come day look mother say keep father come claim year father come hear think sure little money mother leave use say money wish tell story girl know sure day father come give money spend repay goodness see help love impossible girl have friend love know wild do sort mad thing seem help hurt last know be great disturbance school desk tamper know course find desk send ask caricature draw book look tell truth conceal thing tell whole truth know believe say more do 
18,"Here Annie paused, she began to unclasp and clasp her hands, and she looked full at Mr Everard with a most pleading expression.",pause begin unclasp clasp hand look full plead expression 
19,"""Do you mind repeating to me exactly what you said to your governess?"" he questioned.",mind repeat say governess question 
20,"""I said this, sir.  I said, `Yes, Mrs Willis, I did draw that caricature.  You will scarcely understand how I, who love you so much, could have been so mad and ungrateful as to do anything to turn you into ridicule.  I would cut off my right hand now not to have done it; but I did do it, and I must tell you the truth.'  `Tell me, dear,' she said, quite gently then.  `It was one wet afternoon about a fortnight ago,' I said to her; `a lot of us middle-school-girls were sitting together, and I had a pencil and some bits of paper, and I was making up funny little groups of a lot of us, and the girls were screaming with laughter, for somehow I managed to make the likeness that I wanted in each case.'  It was very wrong of me, I know.  It was against the rules; but I was in one of my maddest humours, and I really do not care what the consequences were.  At last one of the girls said: `You won't dare to make a picture like that of Mrs Willis, Annie--you know you won't dare.'  The minute she said that name I began to feel ashamed.  I remembered I was breaking one of the rules, and I suddenly tore up all my bits of paper and flung them into the fire, and I said, `No, I would not dare to show her dishonour.'  Well, afterwards, as I was washing my hands for tea up in my room, the temptation came over me so strongly that I felt I could not resist it, to make a funny little sketch of Mrs Willis.  I had a little scrap of thin paper, and I took out my pencil and did it all in a minute.  It seemed to me very funny, and I could not help laughing at it; and then I thrust it into my private writing-case, which I always keep locked, and I put the key in my pocket and ran downstairs.  I forgot all about the caricature.  I had never shown it to anyone.  How it got into Cecil's book is more than I can say.  When I had finished speaking Mrs Willis looked very hard at the book.  `You are right,' she said; `this caricature is drawn on a very thin piece of paper, which has been cleverly pasted on the title-page.'  Then, Mr Everard, she asked me a lot of questions.  Had I ever parted with my keys?  Had I ever left my desk unlocked?  `No,' I said, `my desk is always locked, and my keys are always in my pocket.  Indeed,' I added, `my keys were absolutely safe for the last week, for they went in a white petticoat to the wash, and came back as rusty as possible.'  I could not open my desk for a whole week, which was a great nuisance.  I told all this story to Mrs Willis, and she said to me, `You are positively certain that this caricature has been taken out of your desk by somebody else, and pasted in here?  You are sure that the caricature you drew is not to be found in your desk?'  `Yes,' I said; `how can I be anything but sure; these are my pencil marks, and that is the funny little turn I gave to your neck which made me laugh when I drew it. Yes; I am certainly sure.'",say sir say draw caricature understand love mad ungrateful do turn ridicule cut right hand do do tell truth tell dear say wet afternoon fortnight say lot middle school girl sit have pencil bit paper make funny little group lot girl scream laughter manage make likeness want case wrong know rule maddest humour care consequence last girl say dare make picture know dare minute say name begin feel ashamed remember break rule tore bit paper flung fire say dare show dishonour wash hand tea room temptation come feel resist make funny little sketch have little scrap thin paper take pencil do minute seem funny help laugh thrust private writing case keep lock put key pocket run forget caricature show get book more say finish speak look book right say caricature draw thin piece paper paste title page ask lot question part key leave desk unlock say desk lock key pocket add key safe last week go white petticoat wash come rusty possible open desk whole week great nuisance tell story say certain caricature take desk else paste sure caricature draw find desk say sure pencil mark funny little turn give neck make laugh draw sure

You have never seen an attempt at this kind of drawing amongst your school-fellows, or amongst any of the teachers?'",tell say only girl school draw caricature see attempt kind draw school fellow teacher

26,"""I did so, and she made me put the rusty key in the lock and open the desk, and together we searched through its contents.

29,"""`Oh, I forgot my private drawer,' I said; `but there is nothing in it-- nothing whatever,' and then I touched the spring, and pulled it open, and there lay the little caricature which I had drawn in the bottom of the drawer.  There it lay, not as I had left it, for I had never put it into the private drawer.  I saw Mrs Willis's face turn very white, and I noticed that her hands trembled.  I was all red myself, and very hot, and there was a choking lump in my throat, and I could not have got a single word out even if I had wished to.  So I began scrambling the things back into my desk, as hard as ever I could, and then I locked it, and put the rusty keys back in my pocket.",forget private drawer say be touch spring pull open lay little caricature draw bottom drawer lay leave put private drawer see face turn white notice hand tremble red hot be choke lump throat get single word wish begin scramble thing desk lock put rusty key pocket

32,"""That is the whole story, Mr Everard,"" continued Annie.  ""I have no explanation whatever to give.  I did make the one caricature of my dear governess.  I did not make the other.  The second caricature is certainly a copy of the first, but I did not make it.  I don't know who made it.  I have no light whatever to throw on the subject.  You see after all,"" added Annie Forest, raising her eyes to the clergyman's face, ""it is impossible for you to believe me.  Mrs Willis does not believe me, and you cannot be expected to.  I don't suppose you are to be blamed.  I don't see how you can help yourself.""",whole story continue have explanation give make caricature dear governess make other second caricature copy first make know make have light throw subject see add raise eye clergyman face impossible believe believe expect suppose blame see help 
33,"""The circumstantial evidence is very strong against you, Annie,"" replied the clergyman; ""still, I promised to believe, and I have no intention of going back from my word.  If, in the presence of God in this little church you would willingly and deliberately tell me a lie I should never trust human being again.  No, Annie Forest, you have many faults, but you are not a liar.  I see the impress of truth on your brow, in your eyes, on your lips.  This is a very gainful mystery, my child; but I believe you.  I am going to see Mrs Willis now.  God bless you, Annie. Be brave, be courageous, don't foster malice in your heart to any unknown enemy.  An enemy has truly done this thing, poor child; but God Himself will bring this mystery to light.

34,"While Mr Everard was speaking, Annie's whole expressive face had changed; the sullen look had left it; the eyes were bright with renewed hope; the lips had parted in smiles.  There was a struggle for speech, but no words came; the young girl stooped down and raised the old clergyman's withered hands to her lips.",speak whole expressive face change sullen look leave eye bright renew hope lip part smile be struggle speech word come young girl stoop raise old clergyman wither hand lip
