4,"So they wetted his ears, and some of the milk ran down his neck under the red jersey. It was very dark in the tunnel. The candle end Peter had carried, and which now burned on a flat stone, gave hardly any light at all.",wett ear milk run neck red jersey dark tunnel candle end carry burn flat stone give light

32,"“Now,” said Bobbie, “I’ll stay with him. You take the longest bit of candle, and, oh--be quick, for this bit won’t burn long.”",say stay take long bit candle quick bit burn

37,So they hurried up.,hurry 
38,"Bobbie watched their dark figures and the little light of the little candle with an odd feeling of having come to the end of everything. She knew now, she thought, what nuns who were bricked up alive in convent walls felt like. Suddenly she gave herself a little shake.",watch dark figure little light little candle odd feeling come end know think nun brick alive convent wall feel give little shake 
39,"“Don’t be a silly little girl,” she said. She was always very angry when anyone else called her a little girl, even if the adjective that went first was not “silly” but “nice” or “good” or “clever.” And it was only when she was very angry with herself that she allowed Roberta to use that expression to Bobbie.",silly little girl say angry else call little girl adjective go silly nice good clever angry allow use expression 
40,"She fixed the little candle end on a broken brick near the red-jerseyed boy’s feet. Then she opened Peter’s knife. It was always hard to manage--a halfpenny was generally needed to get it open at all. This time Bobbie somehow got it open with her thumbnail. She broke the nail, and it hurt horribly. Then she cut the boy’s bootlace, and got the boot off. She tried to pull off his stocking, but his leg was dreadfully swollen, and it did not seem to be the proper shape. So she cut the stocking down, very slowly and carefully. It was a brown, knitted stocking, and she wondered who had knitted it, and whether it was the boy’s mother, and whether she was feeling anxious about him, and how she would feel when he was brought home with his leg broken. When Bobbie had got the stocking off and saw the poor leg, she felt as though the tunnel was growing darker, and the ground felt unsteady, and nothing seemed quite real.",fix little candle end break brick red jersey boy foot open knife hard manage halfpenny need get open time get open thumbnail break nail hurt cut boy bootlace get boot try pull stock leg swollen seem proper shape cut stock brown knite stock wonder knite boy mother feel anxious feel bring leg break get stock see poor leg feel tunnel grow dark ground feel unsteady seem real

Her flannel petticoat to-day was white, but it would be quite as soft as a red one. She took it off.",remember day tear red flannel petticoat make danger signal stop train prevent accident flannel petticoat day white soft red one take

77,"“Let’s hold hands,” said the boy, and it was really rather good of him, because he was like most boys of his age and hated all material tokens of affection, such as kissing and holding of hands. He called all such things “pawings,” and detested them.",let hold hand say boy good most boy age hate material token affection such kissing hold hand call such thing pawing detest 
78,"The darkness was more bearable to Bobbie now that her hand was held in the large rough hand of the red-jerseyed sufferer; and he, holding her little smooth hot paw, was surprised to find that he did not mind it so much as he expected. She tried to talk, to amuse him, and “take his mind off” his sufferings, but it is very difficult to go on talking in the dark, and presently they found themselves in a silence, only broken now and then by a--",darkness bearable hand hold large rough hand red jersey sufferer hold little smooth hot paw surprise find mind expect try talk amuse take mind suffering difficult go talk dark find silence break

There were no accidents unless you count Phyllis’s catching her frock on a wire, and tearing a long, jagged slit in it, and tripping over her bootlace when it came undone, or going down on her hands and knees, all four of which were grazed.",tramp long way tunnel daylight candle grease drip finger be accident count catching frock wire tear long jagge slit trip bootlace come undone go hand knee graze

98,"It was very hot in the sunshine, and both children were hot and breathless by the time they stopped, and bending their heads back to look up at the open windows of the signal-box, shouted “Hi!” as loud as their breathless state allowed. But no one answered. The signal-box stood quiet as an empty nursery, and the handrail of its steps was hot to the hands of the children as they climbed softly up. They peeped in at the open door. The signalman was sitting on a chair tilted back against the wall. His head leaned sideways, and his mouth was open. He was fast asleep.",hot sunshine child hot breathless time stop bending head look open window signal box shout breathless state allow answer signal box stand quiet empty nursery handrail step hot hand child climb peep open door signalman sit chair tilt wall head learn mouth open fast asleep 
99,"“My hat!” cried Peter; “wake up!” And he cried it in a terrible voice, for he knew that if a signalman sleeps on duty, he risks losing his situation, let alone all the other dreadful risks to trains which expect him to tell them when it is safe for them to go their ways.",hat cry wake cry terrible voice know signalman sleep duty risk lose situation let alone other dreadful risk train expect tell safe go way 
100,"The signalman never moved. Then Peter sprang to him and shook him. And slowly, yawning and stretching, the man awoke. But the moment he WAS awake he leapt to his feet, put his hands to his head “like a mad maniac,” as Phyllis said afterwards, and shouted:--",signalman move spring shake yawning stretch man awoke moment awake leapt foot put hand head mad maniac say shout

He was very pale, and the sweat stood on his forehead “like large dewdrops on a white cabbage,” as Phyllis remarked later. He was trembling, too; the children could see his big hairy hands shake from side to side, “with quite extra-sized trembles,” to use the subsequent words of Peter. He drew long breaths. Then suddenly he cried, “Thank God, thank God you come in when you did--oh, thank God!” and his shoulders began to heave and his face grew red again, and he hid it in those large hairy hands of his.",man look clock spring lever wrench way electric bell tingle wire crank creak man throw chair pale sweat stand forehead large dewdrop white cabbage remark tremble child see big hairy hand shake side side extra-sized tremble use subsequent word draw long breath cry thank thank come thank shoulder begin heave face grow red hide large hairy hand
