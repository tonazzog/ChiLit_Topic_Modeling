1,CHAPTER 42. HESTER.,
2,"At Lavender House the confusion, the terror, and the dismay were great. For several hours the girls seemed quite to lose their heads, and just when, under Mrs Willis's and the other teachers' calmness and determination, they were being restored to discipline and order, the excitement and alarm broke out afresh when some one brought Annie's little note to Mrs Willis, and the school discovered that she also was missing.",confusion terror dismay great several hour girl seem lose head other teacher calmness determination restore discipline order excitement alarm break one bring little note school discover miss 
3,"On this occasion no one did doubt her motives; disobedient as her act was, no one wasted words of blame on her.  All, from the head-mistress to the smallest child in the school, knew that it was love for little Nan that had taken Annie off; and the tears started to Mrs Willis's eyes when she first read the tiny note, and then placed it tenderly in, her desk.  Hester's face became almost ashen in its hue when she heard what Annie had done.",occasion doubt motive disobedient act waste word blame head mistress small child school know love little nan take tear start eye read tiny note place desk face become ashen hue hear do 
4,"""Annie has gone herself to bring back Nan to you, Hester,"" said Phyllis. ""It was I told her, and I know now by her face that she must have made up her mind at once.""",go bring say tell know face make mind 
5,"""Very disobedient of her to go,"" said Dora Russell; but no one took up Dora's tone, and Mary Price said, after a pause--",disobedient go say take tone say pause 
6,"""Disobedient or not, it was brave--it was really very plucky.""",disobedient brave plucky 
7,"""It is my opinion,"" said Nora, ""that if anyone in the world can find little Nan it will be Annie.  You remember.  Phyllis, how often she has talked to us about gipsies, and what a lot she knows about them?""",opinion say world find little remember talk gipsie lot know 
8,"""Oh, yes; she'll be better than fifty policemen,"" echoed several girls; and then two or three young faces were turned toward Hester, and some voice said almost scornfully--""You'll have to love Annie now; you'll have to admit that there is something good in our Annie when she brings your little Nan home again.""",good policemen echoe several girl young face turn voice say have love have admit be good bring little home 
9,"Hester's lips quivered; she tried to speak, but a sudden burst of tears came from her instead.  She walked slowly out of the astonished little group, who none of them believed that proud Hester Thornton could weep.",lip quiver try speak sudden burst tear come walk astonished little group believe proud weep 
10,"The wretched girl rushed up to her room, where she threw herself on her bed and gave way to some of the bitterest tears she had ever shed.  All her indifference to Annie, all her real unkindness, all her ever-increasing dislike came back now to torture and harass her.  She began to believe with the girls that Annie would be successful; she began dimly to acknowledge in her heart the strange power which this child possessed; she guessed that Annie would heap coals of fire on her head by bringing back her little sister.  She hoped, she longed, she could almost have found it in her heart to pray that some one else, not Annie, might save little Nan.",wretched girl rush room throw bed give way bitterest tear shed indifference real unkindness increase dislike come torture harass begin believe girl successful begin acknowledge heart strange power child possess guess heap coal fire head bring little sister hope long find heart pray one else save little 
11,"For not yet had Hester made up her mind to confess the truth about Annie Forest.  To confess the truth now meant humiliation in the eyes of the whole school.  Even for Nan's sake she could not, she would not, be great enough for this.",make mind confess truth confess truth mean humiliation eye whole school sake great 
12,"Sobbing on her bed, trembling from head to foot, in an agony of almost uncontrollable grief, she could not bring her proud and stubborn little heart to accept God's only way of piece.  No, she hoped she might be able to influence Susan Drummond and induce her to confess, and if Annie was not cleared in that way, if she really saved little Nan, she would doubtless be restored to much of her lost favour in the school.",sobb bed tremble head foot agony uncontrollable grief bring proud stubborn little heart accept only way piece hope able influence induce confess clear way save little restore much lose favour school 
13,"Hester had never been a favourite at Lavender House; but now her great trouble caused all the girls to speak to her kindly and considerately, and as she lay on her bed she presently heard a gentle step on the floor of her room--a cool little hand was laid tenderly on her forehead, and opening her swollen eyes, she met Cecil's loving gaze.",favourite great trouble cause girl speak lay bed hear gentle step floor room cool little hand lay forehead open swollen eye meet loving gaze 
14,"""There is no news yet, Hester,"" said Cecil; ""but Mrs Willis has just gone herself into Sefton, and will not lose an hour in getting further help.  Mrs Willis looks quite haggard.  Of course she is very anxious both about Annie and Nan.""",be news say go lose hour get further help look haggard course anxious 
15,"""Oh, Annie is safe enough,"" murmured Hester, burying her head in the bedclothes.",safe murmure bury head bedclothe 
16,"""I don't know; Annie is very impulsive, and very pretty; the gipsies may like to steal her too--of course she has gone straight to one of their encampments.  Naturally Mrs Willis is most anxious.""",know impulsive pretty gipsie like steal course go encampment anxious 
17,Hester pressed her hand to her throbbing head.,press hand throbbing head 
18,"""We are all so sorry for you, dear,"" said Cecil gently.",sorry dear say 
19,"""Thank you--being sorry for one does not do a great deal of good, does it?""",thank sorry do great deal good 
20,"""I thought sympathy always did good,"" replied Cecil, looking puzzled.",think sympathy do good reply look puzzle 
21,"""Thank you,"" said Hester again.  She lay quite still for several minutes with her eyes closed.  Her face looked intensely unhappy.  Cecil was not easily repelled, and she guessed only too surely that Hester's proud heart was suffering much.  She was puzzled, however, how to approach her, and had almost made up her mind to go away and beg of kind-hearted Miss Danesbury to see if she could come and do something, when through the open window there came the shrill sweet laughter and the eager, high-pitched tones of some of the youngest children in the school.  A strange quiver passed over Hester's face at the sound; she sat up in bed, and gasped out in a half-strangled voice--",thank say lay several minute eye close face look unhappy repell guess proud heart suffer much puzzle approach make mind go beg kind hearted see come do open window come shrill sweet laughter eager high pitch tone young child school strange quiver pass face sound sit bed gasp half strangle voice 
22,"""Oh!  I can't bear it--little Nan, little Nan!  Cecil, I am very, very unhappy.""",bear little little unhappy 
23,"""I know it, darling,"" said Cecil, and she put her arms round the excited girl.  ""Oh, Hester! don't turn away from me; do let us be unhappy together.""",know darling say put arm excited girl turn let unhappy 
24,"""But you did not care for Nan.""",care 
25,"""I did--we all loved the pretty darling.""",love pretty darling 
26,"""Suppose I never see her again?"" said Hester half wildly.  ""Oh, Cecil! and mother left her to me! mother gave her to me to take care of, and to bring to her some day in heaven.  Oh, little Nan, my pretty, my love, my sweet!  I think I could better bear her being dead than this.""",suppose see say half mother leave mother give take care bring day heaven little pretty love sweet think bear dead 
27,"""You could, Hester,"" said Cecil, ""if she was never to be found; but I don't think God will give you such a terrible punishment.  I think little Nan will be restored to you.  Let us ask God to do it, Hetty--let us kneel down now, we two little girls, and pray to Him with all our might.""",say find think give terrible punishment think little restore let ask do let kneel little girl pray might 
28,"""I can't pray; don't ask me,"" said Hester, turning her face away.",pray ask say turn face 
29,"""Then I will.""",
30,"""But not here, Cecil.  Cecil, I am not good--I am not good enough to pray.""",good good pray 
31,"""We don't want to be good to pray,"" said Cecil.  ""We want perhaps to be unhappy--perhaps sorry; but if God waited just for goodness, I don't think He would get many prayers.""",want good pray say want unhappy sorry wait goodness think get many prayer 
32,"""Well, I am unhappy, but not sorry.  No, no; don't ask me, I cannot pray.""",unhappy sorry ask pray
