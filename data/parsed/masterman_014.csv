1,CHAPTER 14.,
2,"Ready was up before the sun had appeared, and he awakened William.  The knapsacks had been already packed, with two bottles of water in each, wrapped round with cocoa-nut leaves, to prevent their breaking, and the beef and pork divided between each knapsack.  Ready's, which was larger than William's, held the biscuit and several other things which Ready had prepared in case they might require them.",ready sun appear awaken knapsack pack bottle water wrap cocoa nut leave prevent breaking beef pork divide knapsack ready large hold biscuit several other thing ready prepare case require 
3,"As soon as the knapsacks were on, Ready took the axe and gun, and asked William if he thought he could carry a small spade on his shoulder, which they had brought on shore along with the shovels.  William replied that he could; and the dogs, who appeared to know they were going, were all ready standing by them.  Then, just as the sun rose, they turned into the cocoa-nut grove, and were soon out of sight of the tents.",knapsack ready take axe gun ask think carry small spade shoulder bring shore shovel reply dog appear know go ready stand sun rise turn cocoa nut grove sight tent 
4,"""Now, William, do you know,"" said Ready, stopping after they had walked twenty yards, ""by what means we may find our way back again; for you see this forest of trees is rather puzzling, and there is no path to guide us?""",know say ready stop walk yard mean find way see forest tree puzzling be path guide 
5,"""No, I am sure I cannot tell; I was thinking of the very same thing when you spoke; and of Tom Thumb, who strewed peas to find his way back, but could not do it, because the birds picked them all up.""",sure tell think same thing speak strew pea find way do bird pick 
6,"""Well, Tom Thumb did not manage well, and we must try to do better; we must do as the Americans always do in their woods,--we must _blaze_ the trees.""",manage try do good do do wood _blaze tree 
7,"""Blaze them! what, set fire to them?"" replied William.",blaze set fire reply 
8,"""No, no, William.  Blaze is a term they use when they cut a slice of the bark off the trunk of a tree, just with one blow of a sharp axe, as a mark to find their way back again.  They do not _blaze_ every tree, but about every tenth tree as they go along, first one to the right, and then one to the left, which is quite sufficient; and it is very little trouble,--they do it as they walk along, without stopping.  So now we'll begin: you take the other side, it will be more handy for you to have your hatchet in your right hand; I can use my left.  See now--just a slice off the bark--the weight of the axe does it almost.""",blaze term use cut slice bark trunk tree blow sharp axe mark find way _blaze tree tenth tree go first right left sufficient little trouble do walk stop begin take other side handy have hatchet right hand use left see slice bark weight axe do 
9,"""What an excellent plan!"" observed William.",excellent plan observe 
10,"""But I have another friend in my pocket,"" replied Ready, ""and I must use him soon.""",have friend pocket reply ready use 
11,"""What is that?""",
12,"""Poor Captain Osborn's pocket-compass.  You see, William, the _blazing_ will direct us how to go back again; but it will not tell us what course we are now to steer.  At present, I know we are going right, as I can see through the wood behind us; but by and by we shall not be able, and then I must make use of the compass.""",poor pocket compass see _blazing_ direct go tell course steer present know go see wood able make use compass 
13,"""I understand that very well; but tell me, Ready, why do you bring the spade with us--what will be the use of it?  You did not say yesterday that you were going to bring me.""",understand tell ready bring spade use say yesterday go bring 
14,"""No, William, I did not, as I did not like to make your mother anxious; but the fact is, I am very anxious myself as to whether there is any water on this island; if there is not, we shall have to quit it sooner or later, for although we may get water by digging in the sand, it would be too brackish to use for any time, and would make us all ill.  Very often there will be water if you dig for it, although it does not show above-ground; and therefore I brought the spade.""",like make mother anxious fact anxious be water island be have quit get water digg sand brackish use time make ill be water dig show ground bring spade 
15,"""You think of everything, Ready.""",think ready 
16,"""No, I do not, William; but, in our present situation, I think of more things than perhaps your father and mother would: they have never known what it is to be put to their shifts; but a man like me, who has been all his life at sea, and who has been wrecked, and suffered hardships and difficulties, and has been obliged to think or die, has a greater knowledge, not only from his own sufferings, but by hearing how others have acted when they were in distress.  Necessity sharpens a man's wits; and it is very curious what people do contrive when they are compelled to do so, especially seamen.""",present situation think more thing father mother know put shift man life sea wreck suffer hardship difficulty oblige think die have great knowledge own suffering hear other act distress necessity sharpen man wit curious person contrive compel do seamen 
17,"""And where are we going to now, Ready?""",go ready 
18,"""Right to the leeward side of the island.""",right leeward side island 
19,"""Why do you call it the leeward side of the island?""",call leeward side island 
20,"""Because among these islands the winds almost always blow one way; we landed on the windward side; the wind is at our back; now put up your finger, and you will feel it even among the trees.""",island wind blow way land windward side wind back put finger feel tree 
21,"""No, I cannot,"" replied William, as he held up his finger.",reply hold finger 
22,"""Then wet your finger, and try again.""",wet finger try 
23,"William wet his finger, and held it up again.  ""Yes, I feel it now,"" said he; ""but why is that?""",wet finger hold feel say 
24,"""Because the wind blows against the wet, and you feel the cold.""",wind blow wet feel cold 
25,"As Ready said this the dogs growled, then started forward and barked.",ready say dog growl start bark 
26,"""What can be there?"" cried William.",cry 
27,"""Stand still, William,"" replied Ready, cocking his gun, ""and I will go forward to see.""  Ready advanced cautiously with the gun to his hip. The dogs barked more furiously; and at last, out of a heap of cocoa-nut leaves collected together, burst all the pigs which had been brought on shore, grunting and galloping away as fast as they could, with the dogs in pursuit of them.",stand reply ready cock gun go see ready advance gun hip dog bark last heap cocoa nut leave collect burst pig bring shore grunt gallop dog pursuit 
28,"""It's only the pigs,"" said Ready, smiling; ""I never thought I should be half-frightened by a tame pig.  Here, Romulus! here, Remus! come back!"" continued Ready, calling to the dogs.  ""Well, William, this is our first adventure.""",pig say ready smile think half frighten tame pig come continue ready call dog first adventure 
29,"""I hope we shall not meet with any one more dangerous,"" replied William, laughing; ""but I must say that I was alarmed.""",hope meet one dangerous reply laugh say alarm 
30,"""No wonder; for, although not likely, it is possible there may be wild animals on this island, or even savages; but being alarmed is one thing, and being afraid is another: a man may be alarmed, and stand his ground; but a man that is afraid will run away.""",wonder likely possible be wild animal island savage alarm thing afraid man alarm stand ground man afraid run 
31,"""I do not think I shall ever run away and leave you, Ready, if there is danger.""",think run leave ready be danger 
32,"""I'm sure you will not; but still you must not be rash; and now we will go on again, as soon as I have uncocked my gun.  I have seen more accidents happen from people cocking their guns, and forgetting to uncock them afterwards, than you can have any idea of.  Recollect, also, until you want to fire, never cock your gun.""",sure rash go uncock gun see more accident happen person cock gun forget uncock have idea recollect want fire cock gun 
33,"Ready and William continued their way through the cocoa-nut grove for more than an hour longer, marking the trees as they went along; they then sat down to take their breakfast.",ready continue way cocoa nut grove more hour mark tree go sit take breakfast 
34,"""Don't give the dogs any water, William, nor any of the salt meat; give them biscuit only.""",give dog water salt meat give biscuit 
35,"""But they are very thirsty; may not I give them a little?""",thirsty give little 
36,"""No: we shall want it all ourselves, in the first place; and, in the next, I wish them to be thirsty.  And, William, take my advice, and only drink a small quantity of water at a time.  The more you drink, the more you want.""",want first place next wish thirsty take advice drink small quantity water time more drink more want 
37,"""Then I should not eat so much salt meat.""",eat much salt meat 
38,"""Very true; the less you eat the better, unless we find water, and fill our bottles again.""",true less eat good find water fill bottle 
39,"""But we have our axes, and can always cut down a cocoa-nut, and get the milk from the young nuts.""",have axe cut cocoa nut get milk young nut 
40,"""Very true; and fortunate it is that we have that to resort to; but still we could not do very well on cocoa-nut milk alone, even if it were to be procured all the year round.  Now we will go on if you do not feel tired.""",true fortunate have resort do cocoa nut milk procure year go feel tired 
41,"""Not in the least; I am tired of seeing nothing but the stems of cocoa-nut trees, and shall be glad when we are through the wood.""",least tired see stem cocoa nut tree glad wood 
42,"""Then the faster we walk the better,"" said Ready; ""as far as I can judge, we must be about half-way across now.""",fast walk good say ready judge half way 
43,"Ready and William recommenced their journey; and, after half-an-hour's walking, they found that the ground was not so level as it had been-- sometimes they went gradually up hill, at others down.",ready recommence journey half hour walking find ground level go hill other 
44,"""I am very glad to find the island is not so flat here; we have a better chance of finding water.""",glad find island flat have good chance find water 
45,"""It is much steeper before us,"" replied William; ""it's quite a hill.""",steeper reply hill 
46,"The ground now became more undulating, although still covered with cocoa-nut trees, even thicker together than before.  They continued their march, occasionally looking at the compass, until William showed symptoms of weariness, for the wood had become more difficult to get through than at first.",ground become undulating cover cocoa nut tree thick continue march look compass show symptom weariness wood become difficult get first 
47,"""How many miles do you think we have walked, Ready?"" said Willy.",many mile think walk ready say 
48,"""About eight, I should think.""",think 
49,"""Not more than eight?""",more 
50,"""No; I do not think that we have made more than two miles an hour: it's slow work, travelling by compass and marking the trees; but I think the wood looks lighter before us, now that we are at the top of this hill.""",think make more mile hour slow work travel compass mark tree think wood look light top hill 
51,"""It does, Ready; I fancy I can see the blue sky again.""",ready fancy see blue sky 
52,"""Your eyes are younger than mine, William, and perhaps you may--however, we shall soon find out.""",eye young find 
53,"They now descended into a small hollow, and then went up hill again.  As soon as they arrived at the top, William cried out, ""The sea, Ready! there's the sea!""",descend small hollow go hill arrive top cry sea ready be sea 
54,"""Very true, William, and I'm not sorry for it.""",true sorry 
55,"""I thought we never should get out of that nasty wood again,"" said William, as he impatiently pushed on, and at last stood clear of the cocoa-nut grove.  Ready soon joined him, and they surveyed the scene before them in silence.",think get nasty wood say push last stand clear cocoa nut grove ready join survey scene silence
