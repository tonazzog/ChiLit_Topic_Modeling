7,"""But why was that, Gurth?""",
8,"""We were but Saxon swine,"" said Gurth bitterly, ""and a few of us more or less mattered not. We were then serfs of the baron. But my mother fled with me on the news of my father's death. For years we remained far away, with some friends in a forest near Oxford. Then she pined for her native air, and came back and entered the service of the franklin.""",saxon swine say few more matter serf baron mother flead news father death year remain friend forest pine native air come enter service 
9,"""But why should your mother have taken you away?"" Cuthbert asked.",mother take ask 
10,"""She always believed, Master Cuthbert, that my father was killed by the baron, to prevent him giving any news of the secrets of the castle. He and some others had been kept in the walls for many months, and were engaged in the making of secret passages.""",believe father kill baron prevent give news secret castle other keep wall many month engage making secret passage 
11,"""That is just what I came to ask you, Gurth. I have heard something of this story before, and now that we are attacking Wortham Castle, and the earl has sworn to level it to the ground, it is of importance if possible to find out whether any of the secret passages lead beyond the castle, and if so, where. Almost all the castles have, I have been told, an exit by which the garrison can at will make sorties or escape; and I thought that maybe you might have heard enough to give us some clue as to the existence of such a passage at Wortham.""",come ask hear story attack earl swear level ground importance possible find secret passage lead castle castle tell exit garrison make sorty escape think hear give clue existence passage

14,"""What makes you think that this is so, Gurth?""",make think 
15,"""I had been with my mother to carry some clothes to my father on the last occasion on which I saw him. As we neared the castle I saw my father and three other of the workmen, together with the baron, coming down from the castle towards the spot. As my mother did not wish to approach while the baron was at hand, we stood within the trees at the edge of the wood, and watched what was being done. The baron came with them down to the bushes, and then they again came out, crossed the river, and one of them cut some willows, peeled them, and erected the white staves in a line towards the castle. They walked for a bit on each side, and seemed to be making calculations. Then they went back into the castle, and I never saw my father again.""",mother carry clothes father last occasion see near castle see father other workmen baron come castle spot mother wish approach baron hand stand tree edge wood watch do baron come bush come cross river cut willow peel erect white stave line castle walk bit side seem make calculation go castle see father 
16,"""Why did you not go in at once according to your intention?""",go accord intention 
17,"""Because my mother said that she thought some important work was on hand, and that maybe the baron would not like that women should know aught of it, for he was of suspicious and evil mind. More than this I know not. The castle had already been finished, and most of the masons discharged. There were, however, a party of serfs kept at work, and also some masons, and rumour had it that they were engaged in making the secret passages. Whether it was so or not I cannot say, but I know that none of that party ever left the castle alive. It was given out that a bad fever had raged there, but none believed it; and the report went about, and was I doubt not true, that all had been killed, to preserve the secret of the passage.""",mother say think important work hand baron like woman know aught suspicious evil mind more know castle finish most mason discharge be party serf keep work mason rumour have engage make secret passage say know party leave castle alive give bad fever rage believe report go doubt true kill preserve secret passage

24,"Cnut arrived in a few minutes, somewhat wondering at the message. He brightened greatly when Cuthbert told him what he had learned.",arrive few minute wonder message brighten tell learn 
25,"""This is indeed important,"" he said. ""We will lose no time in searching the copse you speak of. You and I, together with two of my most trusty men, with axes to clear away the brush, will do. At present a thing of this sort had best be kept between as few as may be.""",important say lose time search copse speak trusty man axe clear brush do present thing sort keep few 
26,They started at once and soon came down upon the stream.,start come stream 
27,"It ran at this point in a little valley, some twenty or thirty feet deep. On the bank not far from the castle grew a small wood, and it was in this that Cuthbert hoped to find the passage spoken of by Gurth.",run point little valley foot deep bank castle grow small wood hope find passage speak 
28,The trees and brushwood were so thick that it was apparent at once that if the passage had ever existed it had been unused for some years.,tree brushwood thick apparent passage exist unused year 
29,The woodmen were obliged to chop down dozens of young saplings to make their way up from the water towards the steeper part of the bank.,woodmen oblige chop dozen young sapling make way water steeper part bank 
30,"The wood was some fifty yards in length, and as it was uncertain at which point the passage had come out, a very minute search had to be made.",wood yard length uncertain point passage come minute search have make 
31,"""What do you think it would be like, Cnut?"" Cuthbert asked.",think ask 
32,"""Like enough to a rabbit-hole, or more likely still there would be no hole whatever. We must look for moss and greenery, for it is likely that such would have been planted, so as to conceal the door from any passer-by, while yet allowing a party from inside to cut their way through it without difficulty.""",enough rabbit hole likely be hole look moss greenery likely such plant conceal door passer allow party cut way difficulty 
33,"After a search of two hours, Cnut decided that the only place in the copse in which it was likely that the entrance to a passage could be hidden, was a spot where the ground was covered thickly with ivy and trailing plants.",search hour decide only place copse likely entrance passage hide spot ground cover ivy trail plant

35,"""Ay, lad, but we know not what lies behind this thick screen of ivy. Thrust in that staff.""",know lie thick screen ivy thrust staff

For some time he was met by the solid ground, but presently the butt of the staff went through suddenly, pitching him on his head, amidst a suppressed laugh from his comrades.",woodmen begin probe end staff ivy time meet solid ground butt staff go pitch head suppress laugh comrade 
37,"""Here it is, if anywhere,"" said Cnut, and with their billhooks they at once began to clear away the thickly grown creepers.",say billhook begin clear grow creeper 
38,"Five minutes' work was sufficient to show a narrow cut, some two feet wide, in the hill side, at the end of which stood a low door.",minute work sufficient show narrow cut foot wide hill side end stand low door 
39,"""Here it is,"" said Cnut, with triumph, ""and the castle is ours. Thanks, Cuthbert, for your thought and intelligence. It has not been used lately, that is clear,"" he went on. ""These creepers have not been moved for years. Shall we go and tell the earl of our discovery? What think you, Cuthbert?""",say triumph castle thanks thought intelligence use clear go creeper move year go tell earl discovery think

43,"""I want to ask you, sir, not to attack the castle to-morrow until you see a white flag waved from the keep.""",want ask sir attack castle see white flag wave keep

45,"""It may be,"" Cuthbert said, ""that I have some friends inside who will be able to make a diversion in our favour. However sir, it can do no harm if you will wait till then, and may save many lives. At what hour do you mean to attack?""",say have friend able make diversion favour sir do harm wait save many life hour mean attack

47,"""Very well, sir,"" Cuthbert said.

48,"Two or three hours before daylight Cuthbert accompanied Cnut and twenty-five picked men of the foresters to the copse. They were provided with crowbars, and all carried heavy axes. The door was soon prised open. It opened silently and without a creak.",hour daylight accompany pick man forester copse provide crowbar carry heavy axe door prise open open creak 
49,"""It may be,"" Cnut said, ""that the door has not been opened as you say for years, but it is certain,"" and he placed his torch to the hinges, ""that it has been well oiled within the last two or three days. No doubt the baron intended to make his escape this way, should the worst arrive. Now that we have the door open we had better wait quiet until the dawn commences. The earl will blow his bugle as a signal for the advance; it will be another ten minutes before they are fairly engaged, and that will be enough for us to break open any doors that there may be between this and the castle, and to force our way inside.""",say door open say year certain place torch hinge oil last day doubt baron intend make escape way bad arrive have door open have good wait quiet dawn commence earl blow bugle signal advance minute engage enough break open door be castle force way 
50,"It seemed a long time waiting before the dawn fairly broke--still longer before the earl's bugle was heard to sound the attack. Then the band, headed by Cnut and two or three of the strongest of the party, entered the passage.",seem long time wait dawn break earl bugle hear sound attack band head strong party enter passage 
51,"Cuthbert had had some misgivings as to his mother's injunctions to take no part in the fray, and it cannot be said that in accompanying the foresters he obeyed the letter of her instructions. At the same time as he felt sure that the effect of a surprise would be complete and crushing, and that the party would gain the top of the keep without any serious resistance, he considered the risk was so small as to justify him in accompanying the foresters.",have misgiving mother injunction take part fray say accompany forester obey letter instruction same time feel sure effect surprise complete crush party gain top keep serious resistance consider risk small justify accompany forester 
52,"The passage was some five feet high, and little more than two feet wide. It was dry and dusty, and save the marks on the ground of a human foot going and returning, doubtless that of the man who had oiled the lock the day before, the passage appeared to have been unused from the time that it left the hands of its builders.",passage foot high little more foot wide dry dusty save mark ground human foot go return man oil lock day passage appear unused time leave hand builder 
53,"Passing along for some distance they came to another strong oaken door. This, like the last, yielded to the efforts of the crowbars of the foresters, and they again advanced. Presently they came to a flight of steps.",pass distance come strong oaken door last yield effort crowbar forester advance come flight step 
54,"""We must now be near the castle,"" Cnut said. ""In fact, methinks I can hear confused noises ahead.""",castle say fact methink hear confuse noise 
55,"Mounting the steps, they came to a third door; this was thickly studded with iron, and appeared of very great strength. Fortunately the lock was upon their side, and they were enabled to shoot the bolt; but upon the other side the door was firmly secured by large bolts, and it was fully five minutes before the foresters could succeed in opening it. It was not without a good deal of noise that they at last did so; and several times they paused, fearing that the alarm must have been given in the castle. As, however, the door remained closed, they supposed that the occupants were fully engaged in defending themselves from the attacks of the earl's party.",mount step come third door studd iron appear great strength lock side enable shoot bolt other side door secure large bolt minute forester succeed open good deal noise last do several time pause fear alarm give castle door remain close suppose occupant engage defend attack earl party 
56,"When the door gave way, they found hanging across in front of them a very thick arras, and pressing this aside they entered a small room in the thickness of the wall of the keep. It contained the merest slit for light, and was clearly unused. Another door, this time unfastened, led into a larger apartment, which was also at present unoccupied. They could hear now the shouts of the combatants without, the loud orders given by the leaders on the walls, the crack, as the stones hurled by the mangonels struck the walls, and the ring of steel as the arrows struck against steel cap and cuirass.",door give way find hang front thick arra press enter small room thickness wall keep contain merest slit light unused door time unfasten lead large apartment present unoccupied hear shout combatant loud order give leader wall crack stone hurl mangonel strike wall ring steel arrow strike steel cap cuirass 
57,"""It is fortunate that all were so well engaged, or they would certainly have heard the noise of our forcing the door, which would have brought all of them upon us. As it is, we are in the heart of the keep. We have now but to make a rush up these winding steps, and methinks we shall find ourselves on the battlements. They will be so surprised, that no real resistance can be offered to us. Now let us advance.""",fortunate engage hear noise force door bring heart keep have make rush wind step methink find battlement surprise real resistance offer let advance 
58,"So saying Cnut led the way upstairs, followed by the foresters, Cuthbert, as before, allowing five or six of them to intervene between him and the leader. He carried his short sword and a quarterstaff, a weapon by no means to be despised in the hands of an active and experienced player.",say lead way follow forester allow intervene leader carry short sword quarterstaff weapon means despise hand active experienced player 
59,"Presently, after mounting some fifty or sixty steps, they issued on the platform of the keep.",mount step issue platform keep 
60,"Here were gathered some thirty or forty men, who were so busied in shooting with crossbows, and in working machines casting javelins, stones, and other missives upon the besiegers, that they were unaware of the addition to their numbers until the whole of the foresters had gathered on the summit, and at the order of Cnut suddenly fell upon them with a loud shout.",gather man busy shooting crossbow working machine cast javelin stone other missive besieger unaware addition number whole forester gather summit order fall loud shout 
61,"Taken wholly by surprise by the foe, who seemed to have risen from the bowels of the earth by magic, the soldiers of the Baron of Wortham offered but a feeble resistance. Some were cast over the battlement of the keep, some driven down staircases, others cut down, and then Cuthbert, fastening a small white flag he had prepared to his quarter-staff, waved it above the battlements.",take surprise foe seem rise bowel earth magic soldier offer feeble resistance cast battlement keep drive staircase other cut fasten small white flag prepare quarter staff wave battlement 
62,"Even now the combatants on the outer wall were in ignorance of what had happened in the keep; so great was the din that the struggle which had there taken place had passed unnoticed; and it was not until the fugitives, rushing out into the courtyard, shouted that the keep had been captured, that the besieged became aware of the imminence of the danger.",combatant outer wall ignorance happen keep great din struggle take place pass fugitive rush courtyard shout keep capture besiege become aware imminence danger 
63,"Hitherto the battle had been going well for the defenders of the castle. The Baron of Wortham was indeed surprised at the feebleness of the assault. The arrows which had fallen in clouds upon the first day's attack upon the castle among his soldiers were now comparatively few and ineffective. The besiegers scarcely appeared to push forward their bridges with any vigour, and it seemed to him that a coldness had fallen upon them, and that some disagreement must have arisen between the foresters and the earl, completely crippling the energy of the attack.",battle go defender castle surprise feebleness assault arrow fall cloud first day attack castle soldier few ineffective besieger appear push bridge vigour seem coldness fall disagreement arise forester earl cripple energy attack 
64,"When he heard the words shouted from the courtyard below he could not believe his ears. That the keep behind should have been carried by the enemy appeared to him impossible. With a roar he called upon the bravest of his men to follow, and rushing across the courtyard, rapidly ascended the staircase. The movement was observed from the keep, and Cnut and a few of his men, stationed themselves with their battle-axes at the top of various stairs leading below.",hear word shout courtyard believe ear keep carry enemy appear impossible roar call bravest man follow rush courtyard ascend staircase movement observe keep few man station battle axe top various stair lead 
65,"The signal shown by Cuthbert had not passed unobserved. The earl, who had given instructions to his followers to make a mere feint of attacking, now blew the signal for the real onslaught. The bridges were rapidly run across the moat, ladders were planted, and the garrison being paralyzed and confused by the attack in their rear, as well as hindered by the arrows which now flew down upon them from the keep above, offered but a feeble resistance, and the assailants, led by Sir Walter himself, poured over the walls.",signal show pass unobserve earl give instruction follower make mere feint attack blow signal real onslaught bridge run moat ladder plant garrison paralyze confuse attack rear hinder arrow fly keep offer feeble resistance assailant lead pour wall 
66,"Now there was a scene of confusion and desperate strife. The baron had just gained the top of the stairs, and was engaged in a fierce conflict with Cnut and his men, when the news reached him that the wall was carried from without. With an execration he again turned and rushed down the stairs, hoping by a vigorous effort to cast back the foe.",be scene confusion desperate strife baron gain top stair engage fierce conflict man news reach wall carry execration turn rush stair hope vigorous effort cast foe 
67,"It was, however, all too late: his followers, disheartened and alarmed, fought without method or order in scattered groups of threes and fours. They made their last stand in corners and passages. They knew there was but little hope of mercy from the Saxon foresters, and against these they fought to the last. To the Norman retainers, however, of the earl they offered a less determined resistance, throwing down their arms and surrendering at discretion.",late follower dishearten alarm fight method order scatter group three four make last stand corner passage know be little hope mercy saxon forester fight last retainer earl offer determined resistance throw arm surrender discretion 
68,"The baron, when fiercely fighting, was slain by an arrow from the keep above, and with his fall the last resistance ceased. A short time was spent in searching the castle, binding the prisoners, and carrying off the valuables that the baron had collected in his raids. Then a light was set to the timbers, the granaries were fired, and in a few minutes the smoke wreathing out of the various loopholes and openings told the country round that the stronghold had fallen, and that they were free from the oppressor at last.",baron fight slain arrow keep fall last resistance cease short time spend search castle bind prisoner carry valuable baron collect raid light set timber granary fire few minute smoke wreathing various loophole opening tell country stronghold fall free oppressor last
