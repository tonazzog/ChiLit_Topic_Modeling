5,"The loveliest, loveliest garden that ever or never a little girl's eyes saw. As for describing it, I cannot. I must leave a good deal to your fancy. It was just a _delicious_ garden. There was a charming mixture of all that is needed to make a garden perfect--grass, velvety lawn rather; water, for a little brook ran tinkling in and out, playing bo-peep among the bushes; trees, of course, and flowers, of course, flowers of every shade and shape. But all these beautiful things Griselda did not at first give as much attention to as they deserved; her eyes were so occupied with a quite unusual sight that met them.",loveliest loveliest garden little girl eye see describe leave good deal fancy garden be charming mixture need make garden perfect grass velvety lawn water little brook run tinkle play bo peep bush tree course flower course flower shade shape beautiful thing first give much attention deserve eye occupy unusual sight meet 
6,"This was butterflies! Not that butterflies are so very uncommon; but butterflies, as Griselda saw them, I am quite sure, children, none of you ever saw, or are likely to see. There were such enormous numbers of them, and the variety of their colours and sizes was so great. They were fluttering about everywhere; the garden seemed actually alive with them.",butterfly butterfly uncommon butterfly see sure child see likely see be such enormous number variety colour size great flutter garden seem alive

14,"""It's a beautiful place, whatever it is,"" she said, ""and I'm sure, cuckoo, I'm _very_ much obliged to you for bringing me here. Now may I run about and look at everything? How delicious it is to feel the warm sunshine again! I didn't know how cold I was. Look, cuckoo, my toes and fingers are quite blue; they're only just beginning to come right again.

24,"He flew quietly along in front of her, leading the way through the prettiest paths in all the pretty garden. The paths were arranged in different colours, as it were; that is to say, the flowers growing along their sides were not all ""mixty-maxty,"" but one shade after another in regular order--from the palest blush pink to the very deepest damask crimson; then, again, from the soft greenish blue of the small grass forget-me-not to the rich warm tinge of the brilliant cornflower. _Every_ tint was there; shades, to which, though not exactly strange to her, Griselda could yet have given no name, for the daisy dew, you see, had sharpened her eyes to observe delicate variations of colour, as she had never done before.",fly front lead way prettiest path pretty garden path arrange different colour say flower grow side mixty maxty shade regular order palest blush pink deep damask crimson soft greenish blue small grass forget rich warm tinge brilliant cornflower every_ tint shade strange give name daisy dew see sharpen eye observe delicate variation colour do

29,"Griselda thought it as well to take his advice, though not particularly relishing the manner in which it was given. She did use her eyes, and as she and the cuckoo made their way along the flower alleys, she saw that the butterflies were never idle. They came regularly, in little parties of twos and threes, and nibbled away, as she called it, at flowers of the same colour but different shades, till they had got what they wanted. Then off flew butterfly No. 1 with perhaps the palest tint of maize, or yellow, or lavender, whichever he was in quest of, followed by No. 2 with the next deeper shade of the same, and No. 3 bringing up the rear.",think take advice relish manner give use eye cuckoo make way flower alley see butterfly idle come little party two three nibble call flower same colour different shade get want fly butterfly no. palest tint maize yellow lavender quest follow no. next deep shade same no. bring rear

34,"After a while they came to what seemed to be a sort of centre to the garden.

36,"Griselda had to stoop a good deal, but she did manage to get in without knocking her head or doing any damage. Inside was just a mass of butterflies. A confused mass it seemed at first, but after a while she saw that it was the very reverse of confused. The butterflies were all settled in rows on long, narrow, white tables, and before each was a tiny object about the size of a flattened-out pin's head, which he was most carefully painting with one of his tentacles, which, from time to time, he moistened by rubbing it on the head of a butterfly waiting patiently behind him. Behind this butterfly again stood another, who after a while took his place, while the first attendant flew away.",have stake good deal manage get knock head do damage mass butterfly confused mass seem first while see very reverse confused butterfly settle row long narrow white table tiny object size flateen out pin head paint tentacle time time moisten rub head butterfly wait butterfly stand while take place first attendant fly

39,"""All the flowers in the world,"" replied the cuckoo. ""Autumn, winter, and spring, they're hard at work. It's only just for the three months of summer that the butterflies have any holiday, and then a few stray ones now and then wander up to the world, and people talk about 'idle butterflies'! And even then it isn't true that they are idle. They go up to take a look at the flowers, to see how their work has turned out, and many a damaged petal they repair, or touch up a faded tint, though no one ever knows it.""",flower world reply cuckoo winter spring hard work month summer butterfly have holiday few stray one wander world person talk idle butterfly true idle go take look flower see work turn many damage petal repair touch fade tint know

41,"""No,"" said the cuckoo; ""the flowers down here are fairy flowers. They never fade or die, they are always just as you see them. But the colours of your flowers are all taken from them, as you have seen. Of course they don't look the same up there,"" he went on, with a slight contemptuous shrug of his cuckoo shoulders; ""the coarse air and the ugly things about must take the bloom off.

51,"""You won't get any honey,"" the cuckoo was beginning; but he was interrupted. Two handsome butterflies flew into the great glass hall, and making straight for the cuckoo, alighted on his shoulders. They fluttered about him for a minute or two, evidently rather excited about something, then flew away again, as suddenly as they had appeared.",get honey cuckoo begin interrupt handsome butterfly fly great glass hall make cuckoo alight shoulder flutter minute excited fly appear

53,"""What fun!"" cried Griselda. ""Do let's go at once, cuckoo. But, oh dear me,"" she went on, with a melancholy change of tone, ""I was forgetting, cuckoo. I can't go to the banquet.

55,[SHE LOOKED LIKE A FAIRY QUEEN.],looked 
56,"He flew off, and was back almost immediately, followed by a whole flock of butterflies. They were of a smaller kind than Griselda had hitherto seen, and they were of two colours only; half were blue, half yellow. They flew up to Griselda, who felt for a moment as if she were really going to be suffocated by them, but only for a moment. There seemed a great buzz and flutter about her, and then the butterflies set to work to _dress_ her. And how do you think they dressed her? With _themselves_! They arranged themselves all over her in the cleverest way. One set of blue ones clustered round the hem of her little white night-gown, making a thick ""_rûche_,"" as it were; and then there came two or three thinner rows of yellow, and then blue again. Round her waist they made the loveliest belt of mingled blue and yellow, and all over the upper part of her night-gown, in and out among the pretty white frills which Dorcas herself ""goffered,"" so nicely, they made themselves into fantastic trimmings of every shape and kind; bows, rosettes--I cannot tell you what they did not imitate.",fly follow whole flock butterfly small kind see colour half blue half yellow fly feel moment go suffocate moment seem great buzz flutter butterfly set work think dress arrange cleverest way set blue one cluster hem little white night gown make thick _rûche_ come thin row yellow blue waist make loveliest belt mingle blue yellow upper part night gown pretty white frill goffer make fantastic trimming shape kind bow rosette tell imitate 
57,"Perhaps the prettiest ornament of all was the coronet or wreath they made of themselves for her head, dotting over her curly brown hair too with butterfly spangles, which quivered like dew-drops as she moved about. No one would have known Griselda; she looked like a fairy queen, or princess, at least, for even her little white feet had what _looked_ like butterfly shoes upon them, though these, you will understand, were only a sort of make-believe, as, of course, the shoes were soleless.",prettiest ornament coronet wreath make head dot curly brown hair butterfly spangle quiver dew drop move know look fairy queen princess least little white foot have _looked_ butterfly shoe understand sort make believe course shoe soleless

59,"He led the way to a marble basin, into which fell the waters of one of the tinkling brooks that were to be found everywhere about the garden, and bade Griselda look into the water mirror. It danced about rather; but still she was quite able to see herself. She peered in with great satisfaction, turning herself round so as to see first over one shoulder, then over the other.",lead way marble basin fall water tinkle brook find garden bid look water mirror dance able see peer great satisfaction turn see first shoulder other

You don't suppose you are the first little girl they have ever made a dress for?""",bless need trouble say cuckoo butterfly able take care suppose first little girl make dress 
62,"Griselda said no more, but followed the cuckoo, walking rather ""gingerly,"" notwithstanding his assurances that the butterflies could take care of themselves. At last the cuckoo stopped, in front of a sort of banked-up terrace, in the centre of which grew a strange-looking plant with large, smooth, spreading-out leaves, and on the two topmost leaves, their splendid wings glittering in the sunshine, sat two magnificent butterflies. They were many times larger than any Griselda had yet seen; in fact, the cuckoo himself looked rather small beside them, and they were _so_ beautiful that Griselda felt quite over-awed. You could not have said what colour they were, for at the faintest movement they seemed to change into new colours, each more exquisite than the last. Perhaps I could best give you an idea of them by saying that they were like living rainbows.",say more follow cuckoo walk notwithstand assurance butterfly take care last cuckoo stop front sort bank terrace centre grow strange look plant large smooth spread out leave topmost leave splendid wing glitter sunshine sit magnificent butterfly many time large see fact cuckoo look small beautiful feel awe say colour faintest movement seem change new colour exquisite last give idea say live rainbow

66,"""Oh, you silly girl,"" exclaimed the cuckoo, ""always jumping at conclusions. No, indeed, that is not how they manage things in butterfly-land. The king and queen have worked harder than any other butterflies. They are chosen every now and then, out of all the others, as being the most industrious and the cleverest of all the world-flower-painters, and then they are allowed to rest, and are fed on the finest essences, so that they grow as splendid as you see.

70,"""Oh no,"" said the cuckoo; ""they are welcoming you. Hold out your hands.""",say cuckoo welcoming hold hand 
71,"Griselda held out her hands, and stood gazing up into the sky. In a minute or two the royal butterflies appeared again, slowly, majestically circling downwards, till at length they alighted on Griselda's little hands, the king on the right, the queen on the left, almost covering her fingers with their great dazzling wings.",hold hand stand gaze sky minute royal butterfly appear circle length alight little hand king right queen left cover finger great dazzling wing

73,"The king and queen appeared to understand. They floated away from Griselda's hands and settled themselves, this time, at one end of a beautiful little grass plot or lawn, just below the terrace where grew the large-leaved plant. This was evidently their dining-room, for no sooner were they in their place than butterflies of every kind and colour came pouring in, in masses, from all directions. Butterflies small and butterflies large; butterflies light and butterflies dark; butterflies blue, pink, crimson, green, gold-colour--_every_ colour, and far, far more colours than you could possibly imagine.",king queen appear understand float hand settle time end beautiful little grass plot lawn terrace grow large leave plant dining room place butterfly kind colour come pour mass direction butterflies small butterfly large butterfly light butterfly dark butterfly blue pink crimson green gold colour _every_ colour more colour imagine 
74,"They all settled down, round the sides of the grassy dining-table, and in another minute a number of small white butterflies appeared, carrying among them flower petals carefully rolled up, each containing a drop of liquid. One of these was presented to the king, and then one to the queen, who each sniffed at their petal for an instant, and then passed it on to the butterfly next them, whereupon fresh petals were handed to them, which they again passed on.",settle side grassy dining table minute number small white butterfly appear carry flower petal roll contain drop liquid present king queen sniff petal instant pass butterfly fresh petal hand pass

76,"""It's their kind of eating,"" he replied. ""They don't require any other kind of food than a sniff of perfume; and as there are perfumes extracted from every flower in butterfly-land, and there are far more flowers than you could count between now and Christmas, you must allow there is plenty of variety of dishes.""",kind eating reply require other kind food sniff perfume be perfume extract flower butterfly land be more flower count allow be plenty variety dish 
77,"""Um-m,"" said Griselda; ""I suppose there is. But all the same, cuckoo, it's a very good thing I'm not hungry, isn't it? May I pour the scent on my pocket-handkerchief when it comes round to me?

79,"But Griselda grew very tired of the scent feast long before all the petals had been passed round. The perfumes were very nice, certainly, but there were such quantities of them--double quantities in honour of the guest, of course! Griselda screwed up her handkerchief into a tight little ball, so that the one drop of scent should not escape from it, and then she kept sniffing at it impatiently, till at last the cuckoo asked her what was the matter.",grow tired scent feast petal pass perfume nice be such quantity double quantity honour guest course screw handkerchief tight little ball drop scent escape keep sniff last cuckoo ask matter

The long strings of butterflies twisted in and out of each other in the most wonderful way, like ribbons of every hue plaiting themselves and then in an instant unplaiting themselves again.
