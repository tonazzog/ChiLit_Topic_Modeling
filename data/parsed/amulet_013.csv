And that was not wonderful, when you come to think of it, for it was in a boat that they found themselves. A queer boat, with high bulwarks pierced with holes for oars to go through. There was a high seat for the steersman, and the prow was shaped like the head of some great animal with big, staring eyes. The boat rode at anchor in a bay, and the bay was very smooth. The crew were dark, wiry fellows with black beards and hair. They had no clothes except a tunic from waist to knee, and round caps with knobs on the top. They were very busy, and what they were doing was so interesting to the children that at first they did not even wonder where the Amulet had brought them. And the crew seemed too busy to notice the children. They were fastening rush baskets to a long rope with a great piece of cork at the end, and in each basket they put mussels or little frogs. Then they cast out the rope, the baskets sank, but the cork floated. And all about on the blue water were other boats and all the crews of all the boats were busy with ropes and baskets and frogs and mussels.",next moment feel queer rock sway feel go fishing boat wonderful come think boat find queer boat high bulwark pierce hole oar go be high seat steersman prow shape head great animal big stare eye boat ride anchor bay bay smooth crew dark wiry fellow black beard hair have clothes tunic waist knee round cap knob top busy do interesting child first wonder bring crew seem busy notice child fasten rush basket long rope great piece cork end basket put mussel little frog cast rope basket sink cork float blue water other boat crew boat busy rope basket frog mussel 
27,"‘Whatever are you doing?’ Jane suddenly asked a man who had rather more clothes than the others, and seemed to be a sort of captain or overseer.

His eyes met Robert’s--and Robert and the others had no longer any doubt as to where they had seen him before.

84,"The morning was so fresh and bright; their breakfast had been so good and so unusual; they had actually seen the Amulet round the Egyptian’s neck. One or two, or all these things, suddenly raised the children’s spirits. They went off quite cheerfully through the city gate--it was not arched, but roofed over with a great flat stone--and so through the street, which smelt horribly of fish and garlic and a thousand other things even less agreeable. But far worse than the street scents was the scent of the factory, where the skipper called in to sell his night’s catch. I wish I could tell you all about that factory, but I haven’t time, and perhaps after all you aren’t interested in dyeing works. I will only mention that Robert was triumphantly proved to be right. The dye WAS a yellowish-white liquid of a creamy consistency, and it smelt more strongly of garlic than garlic itself does.",morning fresh bright breakfast good unusual see neck thing raise child spirit go city gate arched roof great flat stone street smell fish garlic other thing agreeable bad street scent scent factory skipper call sell night catch wish tell factory have time interested dye work mention prove right dye yellowish white liquid creamy consistency smell garlic garlic

Our interests are the same.’",have half say pin join only chance get remain part half find same time place wise interest same 
93,"Before anyone could say more the skipper came back, and with him the dye-master. His hair and beard were curled like the men’s in Babylon, and he was dressed like the skipper, but with added grandeur of gold and embroidery. He had necklaces of beads and silver, and a glass amulet with a man’s face, very like his own, set between two bull’s heads, as well as gold and silver bracelets and armlets. He looked keenly at the children. Then he said--",say skipper come dye master hair beard curl man dress skipper add grandeur gold embroidery have necklace bead silver glass amulet man face own set bull head gold silver bracelet armlet look child say

99,"So they enjoyed everything to the full, the row from the Island City to the shore, the ride on the donkeys that the skipper hired at the gate of the mainland city, and the pleasant country--palms and figs and cedars all about. It was like a garden--clematis, honeysuckle, and jasmine clung about the olive and mulberry trees, and there were tulips and gladiolus, and clumps of mandrake, which has bell-flowers that look as though they were cut out of dark blue jewels. In the distance were the mountains of Lebanon. The house they came to at last was rather like a bungalow--long and low, with pillars all along the front. Cedars and sycamores grew near it and sheltered it pleasantly.",enjoy full row shore ride donkey skipper hire gate mainland city pleasant country palm fig cedar garden clematis honeysuckle jasmine cling olive mulberry tree be tulip gladiolus clump mandrake have bell flower look cut dark blue jewel distance mountain house come last bungalow long low pillar front sycamore grow shelter
