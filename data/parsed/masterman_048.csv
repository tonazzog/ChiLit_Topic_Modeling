2,"The boat was well loaded that afternoon, and they had a heavy pull round, and hard work afterwards to carry all the articles up.  William and Ready were, therefore, not sorry when their work was done, and they went to bed as soon as they had taken their supper.",boat load afternoon have heavy pull hard work carry article sorry work do go bed take supper 
3,"At sunrise, they went back to the bay in the boat, which they hauled up, and then proceeded to the house, where they found that everyone was ready to start.  Mr Seagrave had collected all the animals, and they set off; the marks on the trees were very plain, and they had no difficulty in finding their way; but they had a good deal of trouble with the goats and sheep, and did not get on very fast.  It was three hours before they got clear of the cocoa-nut grove, and Mrs Seagrave was quite tired out.  At last they arrived, and Mr and Mrs Seagrave could not help exclaiming ""How beautiful!""",sunrise go bay boat haul proceed house find ready start collect animal set mark tree plain have difficulty find way have good deal trouble goat sheep get hour get clear cocoa nut grove tired last arrive help exclaim beautiful 
4,"When they came to where the tents were pitched by the side of the bananas, they were equally pleased: it was quite a fairy spot.  Mrs Seagrave went into her tent to repose after her fatigue; the goats and sheep were allowed to stray away as they pleased; the dogs lay down, panting with their long journey; Juno put Albert on the bed while she went with William to collect fuel to cook the dinner; Ready went to the pits to get some water, while Mr Seagrave walked about, examining the different clumps of trees with which the meadow was studded.",come tent pitch side banana pleased fairy spot go tent repose fatigue goat sheep allow stray pleased dog lay pant long journey put bed go collect fuel cook dinner ready go pit get water walk examine different clump tree meadow studd 
5,"When Ready returned with the water, he called the dogs, and went back towards the yam plantation.  Tommy followed them; the dogs went into the yams, and were soon barking furiously, which pleased Tommy very much; when, of a sudden, out burst again in a drove all the pigs, followed by the dogs, and so close to Tommy that he screamed with fright, and tumbled head over heels.",ready return water call dog go yam plantation follow dog go yam bark pleased sudden burst drive pig follow dog close scream fright tumble head heel

9,"At day dawn, William and Ready had again started, and walked through the cocoa-nut grove back to the house, to bring round in the boat the articles of furniture and the clothes which had been left.  Having collected everything in the house, and procured some more pork and flour from the storehouse, they completed the load by spearing one of the turtles which remained, and putting it into the bottom of the boat; they then set off again for their new residence, and arrived in time for breakfast.",day dawn start walk cocoa nut grove house bring boat article furniture clothes leave collect house procure more pork flour storehouse complete load spear turtle remain put bottom boat set new residence arrive time breakfast

15,"""No, sir; but I think we must give up this day to putting everything to rights, and making everything comfortable inside the tents; to-morrow we will commence the ditch and hedge round the yam plantation.  We need not work very hard at it, for I don't think the pigs will venture here again, as I mean to tie up all the dogs round the yam patch every night, and their barking will keep them off.""",sir think give day put right make comfortable tent commence ditch hedge yam plantation work think pig venture mean tie dog yam patch night barking keep 
16,"""That will be a very good plan, Ready.  What beautiful food there is for the sheep and goats!""",good plan ready beautiful food be sheep goat 
17,"""Yes; this must be their future residence for the best part of the year. I think to-morrow we will begin a piece of the ditch, and show William how to put in the cuttings of prickly pear for the hedge, and then, I should propose that you and I go to the cove to examine the stores and select what it will be necessary to bring round.  I think you said that you must go yourself?""",future residence good part year think begin piece ditch show put cutting prickly pear hedge propose go cove examine store select necessary bring think say go
