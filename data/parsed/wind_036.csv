1,CHAPTER XXXVI. DIAMOND QUESTIONS NORTH WIND,diamond question 
2," MY READERS will not wonder that, after this, I did my very best to gain the friendship of Diamond. Nor did I find this at all difficult, the child was so ready to trust. Upon one subject alone was he reticent--the story of his relations with North Wind. I fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them. At all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this, only then he told me everything. If I could not regard it all in exactly the same light as he did, I was, while guiltless of the least pretence, fully sympathetic, and he was satisfied without demanding of me any theory of difficult points involved. I let him see plainly enough, that whatever might be the explanation of the marvellous experience, I would have given much for a similar one myself.",reader wonder do good gain friendship find difficult child ready trust subject reticent story relation fancy make mind think event little time trust tell regard same light guiltless least pretence sympathetic satisfied demand theory difficult point involve let see explanation marvellous experience give much similar one 
3,"On an evening soon after the thunderstorm, in a late twilight, with a half-moon high in the heavens, I came upon Diamond in the act of climbing by his little ladder into the beech-tree.",evening thunderstorm late twilight half moon high heaven come act climb little ladder beech tree 
4,"“What are you always going up there for, Diamond?” I heard Nanny ask, rather rudely, I thought.",go hear ask think

12,"“You silly! you never have done about that dream. I never dreamed but that one, and it was nonsense enough, I’m sure.”",silly do dream dream one nonsense sure 
13,"“It wasn’t nonsense. It was a beautiful dream--and a funny one too, both in one.”",nonsense beautiful dream funny one 
14,"“But what’s the good of talking about it that way, when you know it was only a dream? Dreams ain’t true.”",good talk way know dream dream true 
15,"“That one was true, Nanny. You know it was. Didn’t you come to grief for doing what you were told not to do? And isn’t that true?”",one true know come grief do tell do true 
16,"“I can’t get any sense into him,” exclaimed Nanny, with an expression of mild despair. “Do you really believe, Diamond, that there’s a house in the moon, with a beautiful lady and a crooked old man and dusters in it?”",get sense exclaim expression mild despair believe be house moon beautiful lady crooked old man duster 
17,"“If there isn’t, there’s something better,” he answered, and vanished in the leaves over our heads.",be be good answer vanish leave head 
18,"I went into the house, where I visited often in the evenings. When I came out, there was a little wind blowing, very pleasant after the heat of the day, for although it was late summer now, it was still hot. The tree-tops were swinging about in it. I took my way past the beech, and called up to see if Diamond were still in his nest in its rocking head.",go house visit evening come be little wind blowing pleasant heat day late summer hot tree top swing take way beech call see nest rock head

24,"“I’m coming,” he returned. “I’ve got all the moon I want to-night.”",come return get moon want night 
25," I heard a rustling and a rustling drawing nearer and nearer. Three or four minutes elapsed, and he appeared at length creeping down his little ladder. I took him in my arms, and set him on the ground.",hear rustling rustle draw nearer minute elapse appear length creep little ladder take arm set ground 
26,"“Thank you, sir,” he said. “That’s the north wind blowing, isn’t it, sir?”",thank say north wind blowing sir 
27,"“I can’t tell,” I answered. “It feels cool and kind, and I think it may be. But I couldn’t be sure except it were stronger, for a gentle wind might turn any way amongst the trunks of the trees.”",tell answer feel cool kind think sure strong gentle wind turn way trunk tree 
28,"“I shall know when I get up to my own room,” said Diamond. “I think I hear my mistress’s bell. Good-night, sir.”",know get own room say think hear mistress bell good night sir 
29,"He ran to the house, and I went home.",run house go 
30,"His mistress had rung for him only to send him to bed, for she was very careful over him and I daresay thought he was not looking well. When he reached his own room, he opened both his windows, one of which looked to the north and the other to the east, to find how the wind blew. It blew right in at the northern window. Diamond was very glad, for he thought perhaps North Wind herself would come now: a real north wind had never blown all the time since he left London. But, as she always came of herself, and never when he was looking for her, and indeed almost never when he was thinking of her, he shut the east window, and went to bed. Perhaps some of my readers may wonder that he could go to sleep with such an expectation; and, indeed, if I had not known him, I should have wondered at it myself; but it was one of his peculiarities, and seemed nothing strange in him. He was so full of quietness that he could go to sleep almost any time, if he only composed himself and let the sleep come. This time he went fast asleep as usual.",mistress rung send bed careful think look reach own room open window look north other east find wind blow blow northern window glad think come real north wind blow time leave come look think shut east window go bed reader wonder go sleep expectation know wonder peculiarity seem strange full quietness go sleep time compose let sleep come time go asleep usual 
31,"But he woke in the dim blue night. The moon had vanished. He thought he heard a knocking at his door. “Somebody wants me,” he said to himself, and jumping out of bed, ran to open it.",wake dim blue night moon vanish think hear knock door want say jump bed run open 
32,"But there was no one there. He closed it again, and, the noise still continuing, found that another door in the room was rattling. It belonged to a closet, he thought, but he had never been able to open it. The wind blowing in at the window must be shaking it. He would go and see if it was so.",be close noise continue find door room rattling belong closet think able open wind blow window shake go see 
33,"The door now opened quite easily, but to his surprise, instead of a closet he found a long narrow room. The moon, which was sinking in the west, shone in at an open window at the further end. The room was low with a coved ceiling, and occupied the whole top of the house, immediately under the roof. It was quite empty. The yellow light of the half-moon streamed over the dark floor. He was so delighted at the discovery of the strange, desolate, moonlit place close to his own snug little room, that he began to dance and skip about the floor. The wind came in through the door he had left open, and blew about him as he danced, and he kept turning towards it that it might blow in his face. He kept picturing to himself the many places, lovely and desolate, the hill-sides and farm-yards and tree-tops and meadows, over which it had blown on its way to The Mound. And as he danced, he grew more and more delighted with the motion and the wind; his feet grew stronger, and his body lighter, until at length it seemed as if he were borne up on the air, and could almost fly. So strong did his feeling become, that at last he began to doubt whether he was not in one of those precious dreams he had so often had, in which he floated about on the air at will. But something made him look up, and to his unspeakable delight, he found his uplifted hands lying in those of North Wind, who was dancing with him, round and round the long bare room, her hair now falling to the floor, now filling the arched ceiling, her eyes shining on him like thinking stars, and the sweetest of grand smiles playing breezily about her beautiful mouth. She was, as so often before, of the height of a rather tall lady. She did not stoop in order to dance with him, but held his hands high in hers. When he saw her, he gave one spring, and his arms were about her neck, and her arms holding him to her bosom. The same moment she swept with him through the open window in at which the moon was shining, made a circuit like a bird about to alight, and settled with him in his nest on the top of the great beech-tree. There she placed him on her lap and began to hush him as if he were her own baby, and Diamond was so entirely happy that he did not care to speak a word. At length, however, he found that he was going to sleep, and that would be to lose so much, that, pleasant as it was, he could not consent.",door open surprise closet find long narrow room moon sink west shine open window further end room low cove ceiling occupy whole top house roof empty yellow light half moon stream dark floor delighted discovery strange desolate moonlit place close own snug little room begin dance skip floor wind come door leave open blow dance keep turn blow face keep picture many place lovely desolate hill side farm yard tree top meadow blow way dance grow delighted motion wind foot grow strong body light length seem borne air fly strong feeling become last begin doubt precious dream have float air will make look unspeakable delight find uplift hand lie dance long bare room hair fall floor fill arched ceiling eye shine think star sweetest grand smile play beautiful mouth height tall lady stake order dance hold hand high see give spring arm neck arm hold bosom same moment sweep open window moon shine make circuit bird alight settle nest top great beech tree place lap begin hush own baby happy care speak word length find go sleep lose much pleasant consent

35,“What does it matter?” returned North Wind.,matter return 
36,"“I should, cry” said Diamond.",cry say 
37,"“But why should you cry? The dream, if it is a dream, is a pleasant one--is it not?”",cry dream dream pleasant one 
38,“That’s just why I want it to be true.”,want true 
39,“Have you forgotten what you said to Nanny about her dream?”,forget say dream 
40,"“It’s not for the dream itself--I mean, it’s not for the pleasure of it,” answered Diamond, “for I have that, whether it be a dream or not; it’s for you, North Wind; I can’t bear to find it a dream, because then I should lose you. You would be nobody then, and I could not bear that. You ain’t a dream, are you, dear North Wind? Do say No, else I shall cry, and come awake, and you’ll be gone for ever. I daren’t dream about you once again if you ain’t anybody.”",dream mean pleasure answer have dream bear find dream lose bear dream dear say cry come gone dream 
41,"“I’m either not a dream, or there’s something better that’s not a dream, Diamond,” said North Wind, in a rather sorrowful tone, he thought.",dream be good dream say sorrowful tone think 
42,"“But it’s not something better--it’s you I want, North Wind,” he persisted, already beginning to cry a little.",good want persist begin cry little 
43,"She made no answer, but rose with him in her arms and sailed away over the tree-tops till they came to a meadow, where a flock of sheep was feeding.",make answer rise arm sail tree top come meadow flock sheep feed 
44,"“Do you remember what the song you were singing a week ago says about Bo-Peep--how she lost her sheep, but got twice as many lambs?” asked North Wind, sitting down on the grass, and placing him in her lap as before.",remember song sing week say lose sheep get many lamb ask sit grass place lap 
45,"“Oh yes, I do, well enough,” answered Diamond; “but I never just quite liked that rhyme.”",answer like rhyme 
46,"“Why not, child?”",child 
47,"“Because it seems to say one’s as good as another, or two new ones are better than one that’s lost. I’ve been thinking about it a great deal, and it seems to me that although any one sixpence is as good as any other sixpence, not twenty lambs would do instead of one sheep whose face you knew. Somehow, when once you’ve looked into anybody’s eyes, right deep down into them, I mean, nobody will do for that one any more. Nobody, ever so beautiful or so good, will make up for that one going out of sight. So you see, North Wind, I can’t help being frightened to think that perhaps I am only dreaming, and you are nowhere at all. Do tell me that you are my own, real, beautiful North Wind.”",seem say good new one good lose think great deal seem sixpence good other sixpence lamb do sheep face know look eye mean do one more beautiful good make one go sight see help frighten think dreaming tell own real beautiful 
48,"Again she rose, and shot herself into the air, as if uneasy because she could not answer him; and Diamond lay quiet in her arms, waiting for what she would say. He tried to see up into her face, for he was dreadfully afraid she was not answering him because she could not say that she was not a dream; but she had let her hair fall all over her face so that he could not see it. This frightened him still more.",rise shoot air uneasy answer lay quiet arm wait say try see face afraid answer say dream let hair fall face see frighten more 
49,"“Do speak, North Wind,” he said at last.",speak say last 
50,"“I never speak when I have nothing to say,” she replied.",speak have say reply 
51,"“Then I do think you must be a real North Wind, and no dream,” said Diamond.",think real dream say 
52,“But I’m looking for something to say all the time.”,look say time 
53,"“But I don’t want you to say what’s hard to find. If you were to say one word to comfort me that wasn’t true, then I should know you must be a dream, for a great beautiful lady like you could never tell a lie.”",want say hard find say word comfort true know dream great beautiful lady tell lie 
54,"“But she mightn’t know how to say what she had to say, so that a little boy like you would understand it,” said North Wind. “Here, let us get down again, and I will try to tell you what I think. You musn’t suppose I am able to answer all your questions, though. There are a great many things I don’t understand more than you do.”",know say have say little boy understand say let get try tell think suppose able answer question be great many thing understand more do 
55,"She descended on a grassy hillock, in the midst of a wild furzy common. There was a rabbit-warren underneath, and some of the rabbits came out of their holes, in the moonlight, looking very sober and wise, just like patriarchs standing in their tent-doors, and looking about them before going to bed. When they saw North Wind, instead of turning round and vanishing again with a thump of their heels, they cantered slowly up to her and snuffled all about her with their long upper lips, which moved every way at once. That was their way of kissing her; and, as she talked to Diamond, she would every now and then stroke down their furry backs, or lift and play with their long ears. They would, Diamond thought, have leaped upon her lap, but that he was there already.",descend grassy hillock midst wild furzy common be rabbit rabbit come hole moonlight look sober wise patriarch stand tent door look go bed see turn vanish thump heel canter snuffle long upper lip move way way kiss talk stroke furry back lift play long ear think leap lap 
56,"“I think,” said she, after they had been sitting silent for a while, “that if I were only a dream, you would not have been able to love me so. You love me when you are not with me, don’t you?”",think say sit silent while dream able love love 
57,"“Indeed I do,” answered Diamond, stroking her hand. “I see! I see! How could I be able to love you as I do if you weren’t there at all, you know? Besides, I couldn’t be able to dream anything half so beautiful all out of my own head; or if I did, I couldn’t love a fancy of my own like that, could I?”",answer stroke hand see see able love do know able dream half beautiful own head love fancy own 
58,"“I think not. You might have loved me in a dream, dreamily, and forgotten me when you woke, I daresay, but not loved me like a real being as you love me. Even then, I don’t think you could dream anything that hadn’t something real like it somewhere. But you’ve seen me in many shapes, Diamond: you remember I was a wolf once--don’t you?”",think love dream forget wake love real being love think dream have real see many shape remember wolf

62,“Not if you saw it?”,see 
63,"“No, not if I saw it ever so plain.”",see plain 
64,"“There’s my Diamond! I will tell you all I know about it then. I don’t think I am just what you fancy me to be. I have to shape myself various ways to various people. But the heart of me is true. People call me by dreadful names, and think they know all about me. But they don’t. Sometimes they call me Bad Fortune, sometimes Evil Chance, sometimes Ruin; and they have another name for me which they think the most dreadful of all.”",be tell know think fancy have shape various way various person heart true person call dreadful name think know call bad evil chance ruin have name think dreadful

84,"“Because I didn’t know it properly myself, and so I couldn’t teach it to you. I could only make a rough guess at something like what it would be, and so I wasn’t able to make you dream it hard enough to remember it. Nor would I have done so if I could, for it was not correct.

We shall make a little journey together, in fact, we shall start earlier, and as the moon will be later, we shall have a little moonlight all the way.”",dear good boy say come night take long time make little journey fact start moon have little moonlight way 
93,"She rose, and swept over the meadow and the trees. In a few moments the Mound appeared below them. She sank a little, and floated in at the window of Diamond’s room. There she laid him on his bed, covered him over, and in a moment he was lapt in a dreamless sleep.",rise sweep meadow tree few moment appear sink little float window room lay bed cover moment lapt dreamless sleep
