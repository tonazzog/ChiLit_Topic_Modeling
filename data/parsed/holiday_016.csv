4," As Harry and Laura grew older, they were gradually treated like friends and companions by Lady Harriet and Major Graham, who improved their minds by frequent interesting conversations, in which knowledge and principle were insensibly instilled into their minds, not by formal instruction, but merely by mentioning facts, or expressing opinions and sentiments such as naturally arose out of the subjects under discussion, and accustoming the young people themselves to feel certain that their own remarks and thoughts were to be heard with the same interest as those of any other person. No surprise was expressed, if they appeared more acute or more amusing than might have been expected,--no angry contempt betrayed itself if they spoke foolishly, unless it were something positively wrong; and thus Major Graham and Lady Harriet succeeded in making that very difficult transition from treating children as toys, to becoming their confidential friends, and most trusted, as well as most respected and beloved associates.",grow old treat friend companion improve mind frequent interesting conversation knowledge principle instill mind formal instruction mention fact express opinion sentiment such arise subject discussion accustom young person feel certain own remark thought hear same interest other person surprise express appear acute amusing expect angry contempt betray speak wrong succeed make difficult transition treat child toy become confidential friend trust respect beloved associate 
5,"Frank had been upwards of five years cruizing on various stations abroad, and many officers who had seen him, gave such agreeable reports to Major Graham of his admirable conduct on several occasions, and of his having turned out so extremely handsome and pleasing, that Lady Harriet often wished, with tears in her eyes, it were possible she might live to see him once again, though her own daily increasing infirmities rendered that hope every hour more improbable. She was told that he spoke of her very frequently, and said once when he met an aged person at the Cape, ""I would give all I possess on earth, and ten times more, if I had it, to see my dear grandmother as well, and to meet her once more."" This deeply affected Lady Harriet, who was speaking one day with unusual earnestness of the comfort it gave, whatever might be the will of Providence in respect to herself, that Frank seemed so happy, and liked his profession so well, when the door flew open, and Andrew hastened into the room, his old face perfectly wrinkled with delight, while he displayed a letter in his hand, saying in a tone of breathless agitation, as he delivered it to Major Graham, ""The post-mark is Portsmouth, Sir!""",upwards year cruize various station many officer see give such agreeable report admirable conduct several occasion turn handsome pleasing wish tear eye possible live see own daily increase infirmity render hope hour improbable tell speak say meet aged person give possess earth time more have see dear grandmother meet more affect speak day unusual earnestness comfort give will respect seem happy like profession door fly open hasten room old face wrinkle delight display letter hand say tone breathless agitation deliver post mark 
6,"Lady Harriet nearly rose from her seat with an exclamation of joy, but unable for the exertion, she sunk back, covering her face with her hands, and listening in speechless suspense to hear whether Frank had indeed returned. Harry and Laura eagerly looked over Major Graham's shoulder, and Andrew lingered anxiously at the door, till this welcome letter was hurriedly torn open and read. The direction was certainly Frank's writing, though it seemed very different from usual, but the contents filled Major Graham with a degree of consternation and alarm, which he vainly endeavoured to conceal, for it informed him that, during a desperate engagement with some slave-ships off the coast of Africa, Frank had been most severely wounded, from which he scarcely recovered before a violent attack of fever reduced him so extremely, that the doctors declared his only chance of restoration was to be invalided home immediately; ""therefore,"" added he, ""you must all unite a prayer for my recovery, with a thanksgiving for my return, and I can scarcely regret an illness that restores me to home. My heart is already with you all, but my frail shattered body must rest some days in London, as the voyage from Sierra Leone has been extremely fatiguing and tedious.""",rise seat exclamation joy unable exertion sink cover face hand listen speechless suspense hear return look shoulder linger door welcome letter tear open read direction writing seem different usual content fill degree consternation alarm endeavour conceal inform desperate engagement slave ship coast wound recover violent attack fever reduce doctor declare only chance restoration invalide add unite prayer recovery thanksgiving return regret illness restore home heart frail shattered body rest day voyage fatiguing tedious 
7,"Lady Harriet made not a single remark when this letter was closed, but tears coursed each other rapidly down her aged cheeks, while she slowly removed her hands from her face, and gazed at Major Graham, who seated himself by her side, in evident agitation, and calling back Andrew when he was leaving the room, he said, in accents of unusual emotion, ""Desire John to inquire immediately whether any steam-boat sails for London to-day.""",make single remark letter close tear course other aged cheek remove hand face gaze seat side evident agitation call leave room say accent unusual emotion inquire steam boat sail day 
8,"""You are right!"" said Lady Harriet, feebly. ""Oh! that I could accompany you! But bring him to me if possible. I dare not hope to go. Surely we shall meet at last. Now indeed I feel my own weakness, when I cannot fly to see him. But he will be quite able for the journey.

10,"A few hours, and uncle David had embarked for London, where, after a short passage, he arrived at his usual lodgings in St. James' Place; but some days elapsed, during which he laboured in vain to discover the smallest trace of Frank, who had omitted, in his hurried letter from Portsmouth, to mention where he intended living in town. One evening, fatigued with his long and unavailing search, Major Graham sat down, at the British Coffee-house, to take some refreshment before resuming his inquiries, and was afterwards about to leave the room, when he observed a very tall interesting young man, exceedingly emaciated, who strolled languidly into the room, with so feeble a step, that he scarcely seemed able to support himself. The stranger took off his hat, sunk into a seat, and passed his fingers through the dark masses of curls that hung over his pale white forehead, his large eyes closed heavily with fatigue, his cheek assumed a hectic glow, and his head sunk upon his hand. In a low subdued voice he gave some directions to the waiter, and Major Graham, after gazing for a moment with melancholy interest at this apparently consumptive youth, was about to depart, when a turn of the young man's countenance caused him to start; he looked again more earnestly--every fibre of his frame seemed suddenly to thrill with apprehension, and at last, in a voice of doubt and astonishment, he exclaimed, ""Frank!""",few hour uncle embark short passage arrive usual lodging day elapse laboure vain discover small trace omit hurry letter mention intend live town evening fatigued long unavailing search sit british house take refreshment resume inquiry leave room observe tall interesting young man emaciated stroll room feeble step seem able support stranger take hat sink seat pass finger dark mass curl hang pale white forehead large eye close fatigue cheek assume hectic glow head sink hand low subdued voice give direction waiter gaze moment melancholy interest consumptive youth about depart turn young man countenance cause start look fibre frame seem thrill apprehension last voice doubt astonishment exclaim 
11,"The stranger sprung from his seat, gazed eagerly round the room, rushed into the arms of Major Graham, and fainted.",stranger spring seat gaze room rush arm faint 
12,"Long and anxiously did uncle David watch for the restoration of Frank, while every means were used to revive him, and when at length he did regain his consciousness, no time was lost in conveying him to St. James' Place, where, after being confined to bed, and attended by Sir Astley Cooper and Sir Henry Halford, during some days, they united in recommending that he should be carried some miles out of town, to the neighbourhood of Hammersmith, for change of air, till the effect of medicine and diet could be fully tried. Frank earnestly entreated that he might be taken immediately to his own home, but this the doctors pronounced quite impossible, privately hinting to Major Graham that it seemed very doubtful indeed whether he could ever be moved there at all, or whether he might survive above a few months.",long do uncle watch restoration means use revive length regain consciousness time lose convey confine bed attend day unite recommend carry mile town neighbourhood change air effect medicine diet try entreat take own home doctor pronounce impossible hint seem doubtful move survive few month 
13,"""Home is anywhere that my own family live with me,"" said Frank in a tone of resignation, when he heard a journey to Scotland pronounced impossible. ""It is not where I am, but who I see, that signifies; and this meeting with you, uncle David, did me more good than an ocean of physic. Oh! if I could only converse with grandmama for half-an-hour, and speak to dear Harry and Laura, it would be too much happiness. I want to see how much they are both grown, and to hear their merry laugh again. Perhaps I never may! But if I get worse, they must come here. I have many things to say! Why should they not set off now?--immediately! If I recover, we might be such a happy party to Scotland again. For grandmama, I know it is impossible; but will you write and ask her about Harry and Laura? The sooner the better, uncle David, because I often think it probable----""",home own family live say tone resignation hear journey pronounce impossible see signify meeting uncle do good ocean physic converse grandmama half hour speak dear much happiness want see much grow hear merry laugh get bad come have many thing say set recover happy party grandmama know impossible write ask good uncle think probable 
14,"Frank coloured and hesitated; he looked earnestly at his uncle for some moments, who saw what was meant, and then added,",coloured hesitate look uncle moment see mean add 
15,"""There is one person more, far distant, and little thinking of what is to come, who must be told. You have always been a father to me, uncle David, but he also would wish to be here now. Little as we have been together, I know how much he loves me.""",be person distant little thinking come tell father uncle wish little know much love 
16,"Frank's request became no sooner known than it was complied with by Lady Harriet, who thought it better not to distress Harry and Laura, by mentioning the full extent of his danger, but merely said, that he felt impatient for the meeting, and that they might prepare on the following day, to embark under charge of old Andrew and her own maid Harrison, for a voyage to London, where she hoped they would find the dear invalid already better; Laura was astonished at the agitation with which she spoke, and felt bewildered and amazed by this sudden announcement. She and Harry had once or twice in their lives caught cold, and spent a day in bed, confined to a diet of gruel and syrup, which always proved an infallible remedy for the very worst attacks, and they had frequently witnessed the severe sufferings of their grandmama, from which, however, she always recovered, and which seemed to them the natural effects of her extreme old age; but to imagine the possibility of Frank's life being in actual danger, never crossed their thoughts for an instant, and, therefore, it was with a feeling of unutterable joy that they stood on the deck of the Royal Pandemonium, knowing that they were now actually going to meet Frank.",request become know complie think good distress mention full extent danger say feel impatient meeting prepare follow day embark charge old own maid voyage hope find dear invalid good astonished agitation speak feel bewilder amaze sudden announcement have life catch cold spend day bed confine diet gruel syrup prove infallible remedy bad attack witness severe suffering grandmama recover seem natural effect extreme old age imagine possibility life actual danger cross thought instant feeling unutterable joy stand deck royal know go meet 
17,"Nothing could be a greater novelty to both the young travellers than the scene by which they were now surrounded; trumpets were sounding--bells ringing--children crying--sailors, passengers, carriages, dogs, and baggage all hurrying on board pell-mell, while a jet of steam came bellowing forth from the waste-pipe, as if it were struggling to get rid of the huge column of black smoke vomited forth by the chimney. Below stairs they were still more astonished to find a large cabin, covered with gilding, red damask, and mirrors, where crowds of strange-looking people, more than half sick, and very cross, were scolding and bustling about, bawling for their carpet bags, and trying to be of as much consequence as possible, while they ate and drank trash, to keep off sea-sickness, that might have made any one sick on shore--sipping brandy and water, or eating peppermint drops, according as the case required. Among those in the ladies' cabin, Laura and Harry were amused to discover Miss Perceval, who had hastened into bed already, in case of being ill, and was talking unceasingly to any one who would listen, besides ordering and scolding a poor sick maid, scarcely able to stand. Her head was enveloped in a most singular night-cap, ornamented with old ribbons and artificial flowers--she wore a bright yellow shawl, and had taken into the berth beside her, a little Blenheim spaniel--a parrot--and a cage of canary birds, the noisy inhabitants of which sung at the full pitch of their voices till the very latest hour of the night, being kept awake by the lamp which swung from side to side, while nothing could be compared to their volubility except the perpetual clamour occasioned by Miss Perceval herself.",great novelty young traveller scene surround trumpet sound bell ring child cry sailor passenger carriage dog baggage hurry board pell mell jet steam come bellow waste pipe struggle get rid huge column black smoke vomit chimney stair astonished find large cabin cover gild red damask mirror crowd strange look person more half sick cross scold bustle bawl carpet bag try much consequence possible eat drink trash keep sea sickness make one sick shore sip brandy water eat peppermint drop accord case require lady cabin amuse discover hasten bed case ill talk one listen order scold poor sick maid able stand head envelop singular night cap ornament old ribbon artificial flower wear bright yellow shawl take berth little spaniel parrot cage canary bird noisy inhabitant sung full pitch voice late hour night keep awake lamp swing side side compare volubility perpetual clamour occasion 
18,"""I declare these little narrow beds are no better than coffins! I never saw such places! and the smell is like singed blankets and cabbages boiled in melted oil! It is enough to make anybody ill! Mary! go and fetch me a cup of tea, and, do you hear! tell those people on deck not to make such a noise--it gives me a headache! Be sure you say that I shall complain to the Captain. Reach me some bread and milk for the parrot,--fetch my smelling bottle,--go to the saloon for that book I was reading,--and search again for the pocket-handkerchief I mislaid. It cost ten guineas, and must be found. I hope no one has stolen it! Now do make haste with the tea! What are you dawdling there for? If you do not stop that noise on deck, Mary, I shall be exceedingly displeased! Some of those horrid people in the steerage were smoking too, but tell the Captain that if I come up he must forbid them. It is a trick to make us all sick and save provisions. I observed a gun-case in the saloon too, which is a most dangerous thing, for guns always go off when you least expect. If any one fires, I shall fall into hysterics. I shall, indeed! What a creaking noise the vessel makes! I hope there is no danger of its splitting! We ought not to go on sailing after dusk. The Captain must positively cast anchor during the night, that we may have no more of this noise or motion, but sleep in peace and quietness till morning.""",declare little narrow bed good coffin see such place smell singed blanket cabbage boil melt oil enough make ill go fetch cup tea hear tell person deck make noise give headache sure say complain reach bread milk parrot fetch smelling bottle go saloon book read search pocket handkerchief mislaid cost guinea find hope steal make haste tea dawdle stop noise deck displeased horrid person steerage smoke tell come forbid trick make sick save provision observe gun case saloon dangerous thing gun go least expect fire fall hysterics creak noise vessel make hope be danger split go sailing dusk cast anchor night have more noise motion sleep peace quietness morning 
19,"Soon after the Royal Pandemonium had set sail, or rather set fire, the wind freshened, and the pitching of the vessel became so rough, that Harry and Laura, with great difficulty, staggered to seats on the deck, leaving both Lady Harriet's servants so very sick below, that instead of being able to attend on them, they gave nine times the trouble that any other passenger did on board, and were not visible again during the whole voyage. The two young travellers now sat down together, and watched, with great curiosity, several groups of strangers on deck: ladies, half sick, trying to entertain gentlemen in seal-skin travelling caps and pale cadaverous countenances, smoking cigars; others opening baskets of provisions, and eating with good sea-faring appetite; while one party had a carriage on the deck so filled with luxuries of every kind, that there seemed no end to the multitude of Perigord pies, German sausages, cold fowls, pastry, and fruit that were produced during the evening. The owners had a table spread on the deck, and ate voraciously, before a circle of hungry spectators, which had such an appearance of selfishness and gluttony, that both his young friends thought immediately of Peter Grey.",royal set sail set fire wind freshen pitching vessel become rough great difficulty stagger seat deck leave servant sick able attend give time trouble other passenger do board visible whole voyage young traveller sit watch great curiosity several group stranger deck lady half sick try entertain gentleman seal skin travelling cap pale cadaverous countenance smoking cigar other open basket provision eat good sea fare appetite party have carriage deck fill luxury kind seem end multitude pie german sausages cold fowl pastry fruit produce evening owner have table spread deck eat circle hungry spectator have appearance selfishness gluttony young friend think 
20,"As evening closed in, Harry and Laura began to feel very desolate thus for the first time in their lives alone, while the wide waste of waters around made the scene yet more forlorn. They had enjoyed unmingled delight in talking over and over about their happy meeting with Frank, and planned a hundred times how joyfully they would rush into the house, and with what pleasure they would relate all that happened to themselves, after hearing from his own mouth the extraordinary adventures which his letters had described. Laura produced from her reticule several of the last she had received, and laughed again over the funny jokes and stories they contained, inventing many new questions to ask him on the subject, and fancying she already heard his voice, and saw his bright and joyous countenance. But now the night had grown so dark and chilly, that both Harry and Laura felt themselves gradually becoming cold, melancholy, and dejected. They made an effort to walk arm-in-arm up and down the deck, in imitation of the few other passengers who had been able to remain out of bed, and they tried still to talk cheerfully, but in spite of every effort, their thoughts became mournful. After clinging together for some time, and staggering up and down, without feeling in spirits to speak, they were still shiveringly cold, yet unwilling to separate for the night, when Harry suddenly stood still, grasping Laura's arm with a look of startled astonishment, which caused her hastily to glance round in the direction where he was eagerly gazing, but nothing became visible except the dim outline of a woman's figure, rolled up in several enormous shawls, and with her bonnet slouched far over her face.",evening close begin feel desolate first time life wide waste water make scene forlorn enjoy unmingled delight talk happy meeting plan time rush house pleasure relate happen hear own mouth extraordinary adventure letter describe produce reticule several last receive laugh funny joke story contain invent many new question ask subject fancy hear voice see bright joyous countenance night grow dark chilly feel become cold melancholy dejected make effort walk arm arm deck imitation few other passenger able remain bed try talk spite effort thought become mournful cling time staggering feel spirit speak cold unwilling separate night stand grasp arm look startle astonishment cause glance direction gaze become visible dim outline woman figure roll several enormous shawl bonnet slouch face 
21,"""I am certain it was her!"" whispered Harry, in a tone of breathless amazement; ""almost certain!""",certain whisper tone breathless amazement certain

24,"""I am sorry you observed me, Master Harry! I did not intend to trouble you and Miss Laura during the voyage,"" said she, turning her face slowly towards him, when, to his surprise, he saw that the traces of tears were on her cheek, and her manner appeared so subdued, and altogether so different from former times, that Laura could scarcely yet credit her senses. ""I shall not be at all in your way, children, but I ---- ---- I must see Master Frank again. He was always too good for this world, and he'll not be here long--Andrew told me all about it, and I could not stay behind. I wish we were all as well prepared, and then the sooner we die the better.""",sorry observe intend trouble voyage say turn face surprise see trace tear cheek manner appear subdued different former time credit sense way child see good world tell stay wish prepare die good 
25,"Harry and Laura listened in speechless consternation to these words. The very idea of losing Frank had never before crossed their imaginations for a moment, and they could have wished to believe that what Mrs. Crabtree said was like the ravings of delirium, yet an irresistible feeling of awe and alarm rushed into their minds.",listen speechless consternation word very idea lose cross imagination moment wish believe say raving delirium irresistible feeling awe alarm rush mind 
26,"""Miss Laura! if you want any help in undressing, call to me at any time. I was sure that doited body Harrison could be of no service. She never was fit to take care of herself, and far less of such as you. It put me wild to think of your coming all this way with nobody fit to look after you, and then the distress that must follow.""",miss want help undressing call time sure doited body service fit take care less such put wild think come way fit look distress follow 
27,"""But surely, Mrs. Crabtree, you do not think Frank so very ill,"" asked Laura, making an effort to recover her voice, and speaking in a tone of deep anxiety; ""he had recovered from the fever, but is only rather too weak for travelling.""",think ill ask make effort recover voice speak tone deep anxiety recover fever weak travel 
28,"""Well, Miss Laura! grief always comes too soon, and I would have held my tongue had I thought you did not know the worst already. If I might order as in former days, it would be to send you both down directly, out of this heavy fog and cold wind.""",grief come hold tongue think know bad order former day send heavy fog cold wind

30,"""Master Harry, I would go round the wide world to serve any one of you! who else have I to care for? But it was chiefly to see Master Frank.

The world must go round,--it must go round, and we can't prevent it.""",go wide world serve have care see let hope good pray prepare event come thing ordain good make good happen world go go prevent 
31,"Harry and Laura hung their heads in dismay, for there was something agitated and solemn in Mrs. Crabtree's manner, which astonished and shocked them, so they hurried silently to bed; and Laura's pillow was drenched with tears of anxiety and distress that night, though gradually, as she thought of Frank's bright colour and sparkling eyes, his joyous spirits and unbroken health, it seemed impossible that all were so soon to fade away, that the wind should have already passed over them, and they were gone, till by degrees her mind became more calm; her hopes grew into certainties; she told herself twenty times over, that Mrs. Crabtree must be entirely mistaken, and at last sunk into a restless agitated slumber.",hang head dismay be agitated solemn manner astonished shock hurry bed pillow drench tear anxiety distress night think bright colour sparkling eye joyous spirit unbroken health seem impossible fade wind pass gone degree mind become calm hope grow certainty tell time mistaken last sink restless agitate slumber 
32,"Next day the sun shone, the sky was clear, and every thing appeared so full of life and joy, that Harry and Laura would have fancied the whole scene with Mrs. Crabtree a distressing dream, had they not been awakened to recollection before six in the morning, by the sound of her voice, angrily rebuking Miss Perceval and other ladies, who with too good reason, were grumbling at the hardship of sleeping, or rather vainly attempting to sleep, in such narrow uncomfortable dog-holes. Laura heard Mrs. Crabtree conclude an eloquent oration on the subject of contentment, by saying, ""Indeed, ladies! many a brave man, and noblemen's sons too, have laid their heads on the green grass, fighting for you, so we should put up with a hard bed patiently for one night.""",next day sun shine sky clear thing appear full life joy fancy whole scene distressing dream awaken recollection morning sound voice rebuke other lady good reason grumble hardship sleeping attempt sleep such narrow uncomfortable dog hole hear conclude eloquent oration subject contentment say lady many brave man noblemen son lay head green grass fight put hard bed night 
33,"Miss Perceval turned angrily away, and summoned her maid to receive a multitude of new directions. ""Mary, tell the Captain that when I looked out last, there was scarcely any smoke coming out of the funnel, so I am sure he is saving fuel, and not keeping good enough fires to carry us on! I never knew such shabbiness! Tell the engineer, that I insist on his throwing on more coals immediately. Bring me some hot water, as fast as possible! These towels are so coarse, I cannot, on any account, use them. After being accustomed to such pocket-handkerchiefs as mine, at ten guineas each, one does become particular. Can you not find a larger basin? This looks like a soup-plate, and it seems impossible here to get enough of hot water to wash comfortably.""",turn summon maid receive multitude new direction tell look last be smoke come funnel sure save fuel keep good enough fire carry know such shabbiness tell engineer insist throw more coal bring hot water possible towel coarse account use accustom such pocket handkerchief guinea become particular find large basin look soup plate seem impossible get enough hot water wash

35,"""Now!"" continued Miss Perceval, ""get me another cup of tea. The last was too sweet, the one before not strong enough, and the first half cold, but this is worse than any. Do remember to mention, that yesterday night the steward sent up a tin tea-pot, a thing I cannot possibly suffer again. We must have the urn, too, instead of that black tea-kettle; and desire him to prepare some butter-toast--I am not hungry, so three rounds will be enough. Let me have some green tea this time; and see that the cream is better than last night, when I am certain it was thickened with chalk or snails. The jelly, too, was execrable, for it tasted like sticking-plaster--I shall starve if better can't be had; and the table-cloth looked like a pair of old sheets. Tell the steward all this, and say, he must get my breakfast ready on deck in half an hour; but meantime, I shall sit here with a book while you brush my hair.""",continue get cup tea last sweet one strong first half cold bad remember mention yesterday night steward send tin tea pot thing suffer have urn black tea- kettle desire prepare butter toast hungry round enough let have green tea time see cream good last night certain thicken chalk snail jelly execrable taste stick plaster starve good have table cloth look pair old sheet tell steward say get breakfast ready deck hour meantime sit book brush hair 
36,"The sick persecuted maid seemed anxious to do all she was bid; so, after delivering as many of the messages as possible, she tried to stand up and do Miss Perceval's hair, but the motion of the vessel had greatly increased, and she turned as pale as death, apparently on the point of sinking to the ground, when Laura, now quite dressed, quietly slipped the brush out of her hand, and carefully brushed Miss Perceval's thin locks, while poor Mary silently dropped upon a seat, being perfectly faint with sickness.",sick persecute maid seem anxious do bid deliver many message possible try stand do hair motion vessel increase turn pale death point sink ground dress slip brush hand brush thin lock poor drop seat faint sickness 
37,"Miss Perceval read on, without observing the change of abigails, till Harry, who had watched this whole scene from the cabin-door, made a hissing noise, such as grooms do when they currycomb a horse, which caused the young lady to look hastily round, when great was Miss Perceval's astonishment to discover her new abigail, with a very pains-taking look, brushing her hair, while poor Mary lay more dead than alive on the benches. ""Well! I declare! was there ever anything so odd!"" she exclaimed in a voice of amazement. ""How very strange! What can be the matter with Mary! There is no end to the plague of servants!""",read observe change abigail watch whole scene cabin door make hiss noise such groom do currycomb horse cause young lady look great astonishment discover new abigail pain take look brush hair poor lay dead alive bench declare be odd exclaim voice amazement strange matter be end plague servant 
38,"""Or rather to the plague of mistresses!"" thought Laura, while she glanced from Miss Perceval's round, red bustling face, to the poor suffering maid, who became worse and worse during the day, for there came on what sailors call ""a capful of wind,"" which gradually rose to a ""stiff breeze,"" or, what the passengers considered a hurricane; and, towards night, it attained the dignity of a real undeniable ""storm."" A scene of indescribable tumult then ensued. The Captain attempted to make his voice heard above the roaring tempest, using a torrent of unintelligible nautical phrases, and an incessant volley of very intelligible oaths. The sailors flew about, and every plank in the vessel seemed creaking and straining, but high above all, the shrill tones of Miss Perceval were audibly heard, exclaiming,",plague mistress think glance round red bustle face poor suffering maid become bad bad day come sailor call capful wind rise stiff breeze passenger consider hurricane night attain dignity real undeniable storm scene indescribable tumult ensue attempt make voice hear roar tempest use torrent unintelligible nautical phrase incessant volley intelligible oath sailor fly plank vessel seem creak strain high shrill tone hear exclaim 
39,"""Are there enough of 'hands' on board? Is there any danger? Are you sure the boiler will not burst? I wish steam-boats had never been invented!

40,"Laura clung closer to Harry, and felt that they were like two mere pigmies, amid the wide waste of waters, rolling and tossing around them, while his spirits, on the contrary, rose to the highest pitch of excitement with all he heard and saw, till at length, wishing to enjoy more of the ""fun,"" he determined to venture above board. By the time Harry's nose was on a level with the deck, he gazed around, and saw that not a person appeared visible except two sailors, both lashed to the helm, while all was silent now, except the deafening noise made by the wild waves and the stormy blast, which seemed as if it would blow his teeth down his throat. Harry thought the two men looked no larger than mice in such a scene, and stood, clinging to the bannisters, perfectly entranced with astonishment and admiration at the novelty of all he saw, and thinking how often Frank must have been in such scenes, when suddenly a wave washed quite over the deck, and he felt his arm grasped by Mrs. Crabtree, who desired him to come down immediately, in a tone of authority which he did not even yet feel bold enough to disobey; therefore, slowly and reluctantly he descended to the cabin, where the only living thing that seemed well enough to move, was Miss Perceval's tongue.",cling feel mere pigmy wide waste water roll toss spirit contrary rise high pitch excitement hear see length wish enjoy more fun determine venture board time nose level deck gaze see person appear visible sailor lash helm silent deafening noise make wild wave stormy blast seem blow tooth throat think man look large mouse scene stand cling bannister entrance astonishment admiration novelty see think such scene wave wash deck feel arm grasp desire come tone authority feel bold disobey descend cabin only living thing seem move tongue

Tiresome creature! don't you see that? My best bonnet will be destroyed! Send the Captain here! He must positively stop that noise on deck; it is quite intolerable. My head aches, as if it would burst like the boiler of a steam-boat! Stupid man! Can't he put into some port, or cast anchor? How can he keep us all uncomfortable in this way! Mary! Mary, I say! are you deaf? Steward! send one of the sailors here to take care of this dog! I declare poor Frisk is going to be sick! Mary! Mary! This is insufferable!

42,"This awful threat had but little effect on one who thought herself on the brink of being buried beneath the waves, besides being too sick to care whether she died the next minute or not; and even Miss Perceval's voice became drowned at last in the tremendous storm which raged throughout the night, during which the Captain rather increased Laura's panic, if that were possible, by considerately putting his head into the cabin now and then to say, ""Don't be afraid, ladies! There is no danger!""",awful threat have little effect think brink bury wave sick care die next minute voice become drown last tremendous storm rage night increase panic possible put head cabin say afraid lady be danger

45,"Nothing gives a more awful idea of the helplessness of man, and the wrath of God, than a tempestuous sea during the gloom of midnight; and every mind on board became awed into silence and solemnity during this war of elements, till at length, towards morning, while the hurricane seemed yet raging with undiminished fury, Laura suddenly gave an exclamation of rapture, on hearing a sailor at the helm begin to sing Tom Bowling.

One only idea filled their hearts, and brightened their countenances, while they looked at each other with a smile of delight, saying, ""now, at last, we are going to see Frank!""",sail stare hospital hulk land last offer place coach hurry eager happy moment meeting ardour think carriage drive wish be rail road town waste thought novelty gain idea metropolis distinct complain see quantity house only idea fill heart brighten countenance look other smile delight say last go see
