1,CHAPTER III. BEING WANTED,wanted 
2," The morning after the children had been the possessors of boundless wealth, and had been unable to buy anything really useful or enjoyable with it, except two pairs of cotton gloves, twelve penny buns, an imitation crocodile-skin purse, and a ride in a pony-cart, they awoke without any of the enthusiastic happiness which they had felt on the previous day when they remembered how they had had the luck to find a Psammead, or Sand-fairy, and to receive its promise to grant them a new wish every day. For now they had had two wishes, Beauty and Wealth, and neither had exactly made them happy. But the happening of strange things, even if they are not completely pleasant things, is more amusing than those times when nothing happens but meals, and they are not always completely pleasant, especially on the days when it is cold mutton or hash.",morning child possessor boundless wealth unable buy useful enjoyable pair cotton glove penny bun imitation crocodile skin purse ride pony cart awoke enthusiastic happiness feel previous day remember have luck find sand fairy receive promise grant new wish day have wish make happy happen strange thing pleasant thing amusing time happen meal pleasant day cold mutton hash 
3,"There was no chance of talking things over before breakfast, because everyone overslept itself, as it happened, and it needed a vigorous and determined struggle to get dressed so as to be only ten minutes late for breakfast. During this meal some efforts were made to deal with the question of the Psammead in an impartial spirit, but it is very difficult to discuss anything thoroughly and at the same time to attend faithfully to your baby brother's breakfast needs. The Baby was particularly lively that morning. He not only wriggled his body through the bar of his high chair, and hung by his head, choking and purple, but he seized a tablespoon with desperate suddenness, hit Cyril heavily on the head with it, and then cried because it was taken away from him. He put his fat fist in his bread-and-milk, and demanded ""nam,"" which was only allowed for tea. He sang, he put his feet on the table--he clamoured to ""go walky."" The conversation was something like this--",be chance talk thing breakfast oversleep happen need vigorous determined struggle dress minute late breakfast meal effort make deal question impartial spirit difficult discuss same time attend baby brother breakfast need lively morning wriggle body bar high chair hang head choke purple seize tablespoon desperate suddenness hit head cry take put fat fist bread milk demand nam allow tea sing put foot table clamoure go walky conversation

8,"""I wonder whether we'd better wish---- Hullo!--you've done it now, my boy!"" And in a flash of glass and pink baby-paws, the bowl of golden carp in the middle of the table rolled on its side and poured a flood of mixed water and gold-fish into the Baby's lap and into the laps of the others.",wonder wish do boy flash glass pink baby paw bowl golden carp middle table roll side pour flood mix water gold fish lap lap other 
9,"Everyone was almost as much upset as the gold-fish; the Lamb only remaining calm. When the pool on the floor had been mopped up, and the leaping, gasping gold-fish had been collected and put back in the water, the Baby was taken away to be entirely re-dressed by Martha, and most of the others had to change completely. The pinafores and jackets that had been bathed in gold-fish-and-water were hung out to dry, and then it turned out that Jane must either mend the dress she had torn the day before or appear all day in her best petticoat. It was white and soft and frilly, and trimmed with lace, and very, very pretty, quite as pretty as a frock, if not more so. Only it was _not_ a frock, and Martha's word was law. She wouldn't let Jane wear her best frock, and she refused to listen for a moment to Robert's suggestion that Jane should wear her best petticoat and call it a dress.",upset gold fish remain calm pool floor mopp leaping gasp gold fish collect put water take re-dress most other have change pinafore jacket bath gold fish water hang dry turn mend dress tear day appear day good petticoat white soft frilly trim lace pretty pretty frock frock word law let wear good frock refuse listen moment suggestion wear good petticoat call dress 
10,"""It's not respectable,"" she said. And when people say that, it's no use anyone's saying anything. You'll find this out for yourselves some day.",respectable say person say use say find day 
11,"So there was nothing for it but for Jane to mend her frock. The hole had been torn the day before when she happened to tumble down in the High Street of Rochester, just where a water-cart had passed on its silvery way. She had grazed her knee, and her stocking was much more than grazed, and her dress was cut by the same stone which had attended to the knee and the stocking. Of course the others were not such sneaks as to abandon a comrade in misfortune, so they all sat on the grass-plot round the sun-dial, and Jane darned away for dear life. The Lamb was still in the hands of Martha having its clothes changed, so conversation was possible.",be mend frock hole tear day happen tumble high water cart pass silvery way graze knee stock more graze dress cut same stone attend knee stock course other such sneak abandon comrade misfortune sit grass plot sun-dial darn dear life hand have clothes change conversation possible 
12,"Anthea and Robert timidly tried to conceal their inmost thought, which was that the Psammead was not to be trusted; but Cyril said--",try conceal inmost thought trust say 
13,"""Speak out--say what you've got to say--I hate hinting, and 'don't know,' and sneakish ways like that.""",speak say get say hate hint know sneakish way 
14,"So then Robert said, as in honour bound, ""Sneak yourself--Anthea and me weren't so gold-fishy as you two were, so we got changed quicker, and we've had time to think it over, and if you ask me""--",say honour bind sneak gold fishy change quick have time think ask 
15,"""I didn't ask you,"" said Jane, biting off a needleful of thread as she had always been strictly forbidden to do. (Perhaps you don't know that if you bite off ends of cotton and swallow them they wind tight round your heart and kill you? My nurse told me this, and she told me also about the earth going round the sun. Now what is one to believe--what with nurses and science?)",ask say bite needleful thread forbidden do know bite end cotton swallow wind tight heart kill nurse tell tell earth go sun believe nurse science 
16,"""I don't care who asks or who doesn't,"" said Robert, ""but Anthea and I think the Sammyadd is a spiteful brute. If it can give us our wishes I suppose it can give itself its own, and I feel almost sure it wishes every time that our wishes shan't do us any good. Let's let the tiresome beast alone, and just go and have a jolly good game of forts, on our own, in the chalk-pit.""",care ask say think spiteful brute give wish suppose give own feel sure wish time wish do good let let tiresome beast go have jolly good game fort own chalk pit

18,Cyril and Jane were more hopeful--they generally were.,hopeful 
19,"""I don't think the Sammyadd does it on purpose,"" Cyril said; ""and, after all, it _was_ silly to wish for boundless wealth. Fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces would have been much more sensible. And wishing to be beautiful as the day was simply donkeyish. I don't want to be disagreeable, but it _was_. We must try to find a really useful wish, and wish it.""",think do purpose say silly wish boundless wealth pound shilling piece sensible wish beautiful day donkeyish want disagreeable try find useful wish wish 
20,Jane dropped her work and said--,drop work say 
21,"""I think so too, it's too silly to have a chance like this and not use it. I never heard of anyone else outside a book who had such a chance; there must be simply heaps of things we could wish for that wouldn't turn out Dead Sea fish, like these two things have. Do let's think hard and wish something nice, so that we can have a real jolly day--what there is left of it.""",think silly have chance use hear else book have chance be heap thing wish turn dead fish thing let think wish nice have real jolly day be leave 
22,"Jane darned away again like mad, for time was indeed getting on, and everyone began to talk at once. If you had been there you could not possibly have made head or tail of the talk, but these children were used to talking ""by fours,"" as soldiers march, and each of them could say what it had to say quite comfortably, and listen to the agreeable sound of its own voice, and at the same time have three-quarters of two sharp ears to spare for listening to what the others said. That is an easy example in multiplication of vulgar fractions, but, as I daresay you can't do even that, I won't ask you to tell me whether 3/4 Ã— 2 = 1-1/2, but I will ask you to believe me that this was the amount of ear each child was able to lend to the others. Lending ears was common in Roman times, as we learn from Shakespeare; but I fear I am getting too instructive.",darn mad time get begin talk make head tail talk child use talk four soldier march say have say listen agreeable sound own voice same time have quarter sharp ear spare listen other say easy example multiplication vulgar fraction do ask tell ask believe amount ear child able lend other lending ear common roman time learn fear get instructive 
23,"When the frock was darned, the start for the gravel-pit was delayed by Martha's insisting on everybody's washing its hands--which was nonsense, because nobody had been doing anything at all, except Jane, and how can you get dirty doing nothing? That is a difficult question, and I cannot answer it on paper. In real life I could very soon show you--or you me, which is much more likely.",frock darned start gravel pit delay insist wash hand nonsense do get dirty do difficult question answer paper real life show likely 
24,"During the conversation in which the six ears were lent (there were four children, so _that_ sum comes right), it had been decided that fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces was the right wish to have. And the lucky children, who could have anything in the wide world by just wishing for it, hurriedly started for the gravel-pit to express their wishes to the Psammead. Martha caught them at the gate, and insisted on their taking the Baby with them.",conversation ear loan be child sum come decide pound shilling piece right wish have lucky child have wide world wish start gravel pit express wish catch gate insist take

29,"With this and a kiss, she plumped the Lamb into Anthea's arms, and went back to make new pinafores on the sewing-machine. She was a rapid performer on this instrument.",kiss plump arm go make new pinafore sewing machine rapid performer instrument 
30,"The Lamb laughed with pleasure, and said, ""Walky wif Panty,"" and rode on Robert's back with yells of joy, and tried to feed Jane with stones, and altogether made himself so agreeable that nobody could long be sorry that he was of the party.",laugh pleasure say ride back yell joy try feed stone make agreeable sorry party 
31,"The enthusiastic Jane even suggested that they should devote a week's wishes to assuring the Baby's future, by asking such gifts for him as the good fairies give to Infant Princes in proper fairy-tales, but Anthea soberly reminded her that as the Sand-fairy's wishes only lasted till sunset they could not ensure any benefit to the Baby's later years; and Jane owned that it would be better to wish for fifty pounds in two-shilling pieces, and buy the Lamb a three-pound fifteen rocking-horse, like those in the big stores, with a part of the money.",enthusiastic suggest devote week wish assure future ask such gift good fairy give proper fairy tale remind fairy wish last sunset ensure benefit late year own good wish pound shilling piece buy pound rock horse big store part money 
32,"It was settled that, as soon as they had wished for the money and got it, they would get Mr. Crispin to drive them into Rochester again, taking Martha with them if they could not get out of taking her. And they would make a list of things they really wanted before they started. Full of high hopes and excellent resolutions, they went round the safe slow cart-road to the gravel-pits, and as they went in between the mounds of gravel a sudden thought came to them, and would have turned their ruddy cheeks pale if they had been children in a book. Being real live children, it only made them stop and look at each other with rather blank and silly expressions. For now they remembered that yesterday, when they had asked the Psammead for boundless wealth, and it was getting ready to fill the quarry with the minted gold of bright guineas--millions of them--it had told the children to run along outside the quarry for fear they should be buried alive in the heavy splendid treasure. And they had run. And so it happened that they had not had time to mark the spot where the Psammead was, with a ring of stones, as before. And it was this thought that put such silly expressions on their faces.",settle wish money get get drive take get take make list thing want start full high hope excellent resolution go safe slow cart road gravel pit go mound gravel sudden thought come turn ruddy cheek pale child book real live child make stop look other blank silly expression remember yesterday ask boundless wealth get ready fill quarry mint gold bright guinea million tell child run quarry fear bury alive heavy splendid treasure run happen have time mark spot ring stone thought put such silly expression face

34,"But this, though easily said, was hard in the doing. They looked and they looked, and, though they found their seaside spades, nowhere could they find the Sand-fairy.",say hard do look look find seaside spade find fairy 
35,"At last they had to sit down and rest--not at all because they were weary or disheartened, of course, but because the Lamb insisted on being put down, and you cannot look very carefully after anything you may have happened to lose in the sand if you have an active baby to look after at the same time. Get someone to drop your best knife in the sand next time you go to the seashore and then take your baby brother with you when you go to look for it, and you will see that I am right.",last have sit rest weary disheartened course insist put look happen lose sand have active baby look same time get drop good knife sand next time go seashore take baby brother go look see right 
36,"The Lamb, as Martha had said, was feeling the benefit of the country air, and he was as frisky as a sandhopper. The elder ones longed to go on talking about the new wishes they would have when (or if) they found the Psammead again. But the Lamb wished to enjoy himself.",say feel benefit country air frisky sandhopper elder one long go talk new wish have find wish enjoy 
37,"He watched his opportunity and threw a handful of sand into Anthea's face, and then suddenly burrowed his own head in the sand and waved his fat legs in the air. Then of course the sand got into his eyes, as it had into Anthea's, and he howled.",watch opportunity throw handful sand face burrow own head sand wave fat leg air course sand get eye have howl 
38,"The thoughtful Robert had brought one solid brown bottle of ginger-beer with him, relying on a thirst that had never yet failed him. This had to be uncorked hurriedly--it was the only wet thing within reach, and it was necessary to wash the sand out of the Lamb's eyes somehow. Of course the ginger hurt horribly, and he howled more than ever. And, amid his anguish of kicking, the bottle was upset and the beautiful ginger-beer frothed out into the sand and was lost for ever.",thoughtful bring solid brown bottle ginger beer rely thirst fail have uncork only wet thing reach necessary wash sand eye course ginger hurt howl more anguish kick bottle upset beautiful ginger beer froth sand lose 
39,"It was then that Robert, usually a very patient brother, so far forgot himself as to say--",patient brother forget say 
40,"""Anybody would want him, indeed! Only they don't; Martha doesn't, not really, or she'd jolly well keep him with her. He's a little nuisance, that's what he is. It's too bad. I only wish everybody _did_ want him with all their hearts; we might get some peace in our lives.""",want keep little nuisance bad wish want heart get peace life 
41,"The Lamb stopped howling now, because Jane had suddenly remembered that there is only one safe way of taking things out of little children's eyes, and that is with your own soft wet tongue. It is quite easy if you love the Baby as much as you ought to do.",stop howl remember be safe way take thing little child eye own soft wet tongue easy love baby do 
42,"Then there was a little silence. Robert was not proud of himself for having been so cross, and the others were not proud of him either.

49,"""No--I can't,"" the Sand-fairy said shortly; ""chopping and changing--it's not business. You ought to be careful what you _do_ wish. There was a little boy once, he'd wished for a Plesiosaurus instead of an Ichthyosaurus, because he was too lazy to remember the easy names of everyday things, and his father had been very vexed with him, and had made him go to bed before tea-time, and wouldn't let him go out in the nice flint boat along with the other children,--it was the annual school-treat next day,--and he came and flung himself down near me on the morning of the treat, and he kicked his little prehistoric legs about and said he wished he was dead.

He didn't turn to stone--I forget why--but there must have been some reason. They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and you're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep or in some better place. You may be sure he caught it, giving them such a turn. Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after that.

63,"At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from Cyril's back to Robert's. And as they paused a very smart open carriage came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the carriage a lady--very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white--and a white fluffy dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck. She looked at the children, and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him. The children were used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a ""very taking child."" So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her to drive on. But she did not. Instead she made the coachman stop. And she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said--",gate road party stop shift pause smart open carriage come sight coachman groom box carriage lady grand dress white lace red ribbon parasol red white white fluffy dog lap red ribbon neck look child smile child use servant say take child wave hand lady expect drive make coachman stop beckon go carriage say

He unfastened the door of the carriage--the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to notice anything--took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping, carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led into a wood. The others followed, and there among the hazels and young oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented brake-fern, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.",crouch dust waddle bent leg side carriage farthest battlefield unfasten door carriage man occupy quarrel notice take arm stoop carry sleeping baby yard road stile lead wood other follow hazel young oak sweet chestnut cover high strong scent brake fern hide angry voice man hush angry voice red white lady long anxious search carriage last drive

91,"Adventures dogged their footsteps. A boy with a bundle of faggots on his back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby, and then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice. They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert couldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to smell their fists. Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for ""the precious Baby,"" and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all their pocket handkerchiefs. ""So that bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark,"" said Cyril severely. Then she went off crying. It presently seemed wise, to the brothers and sisters of the Baby who was wanted by everyone, to hide in the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman, a stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it. They were nearly home when the worst thing of all happened. Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road. The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and feather brushes.
