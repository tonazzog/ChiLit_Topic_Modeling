1,CHAPTER V.,
2," The French sixty-gun ship proved to be the Leonidas; she had been sent out with two large frigates on purpose to intercept the convoy, but she had parted with her consorts in a gale of wind. Her loss of men was very great; that on board of the Portsmouth was trifling. In a couple of hours the Portsmouth and her prize in tow were ready to proceed with the convoy, but they still remained hove to, to wait for the frigates which were in chase of the captured vessels. All of these were speedily come up with except the London Merchant, which sailed so remarkably well. At last, to the great joy of Alfred (who as soon as the bullet had been extracted and his arm dressed, had held his telescope fixed upon the chase), she hove to, and was taken possession of. Before night, the convoy were again collected together, and were steering for their destination. The next morning was clear, and the breeze moderate. Mrs. Campbell, who, as well as all the rest, was very anxious about Alfred, requested Captain Wilson to run down to the Portsmouth, that they might ascertain if he was safe. Captain Wilson did as she requested, and writing in chalk ""all well"" in large letters upon the log-board, held it over the side as he passed close to the Portsmouth. Alfred was not on deck--fever had compelled him to remain in his hammock--but Captain Lumley made the same reply on the log-board of the Portsmouth, and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell were satisfied.",french gun ship prove send large frigate purpose intercept convoy part consort gale wind loss man great board trifl couple hour prize tow ready proceed convoy remain hove wait frigate chase capture vessel come sail last great joy bullet extract arm dress hold telescope fix chase hove take possession night convoy collect steering destination next morning clear breeze moderate rest anxious request run ascertain safe request write chalk large letter log board hold side pass deck fever compel remain hammock make same reply log board satisfy 
3,"""How I should like to see him,"" said Mrs. Campbell.",like see say 
4,"""Yes, madam,"" observed Captain Wilson, ""but they have too much to do on board of the Portsmouth just now; they have to repair damages and to look after the wounded; they have a great quantity of prisoners on board, as you may see, for a great many are now on the booms; they have no time for compliments.""",madam observe have much do board have repair damage look wound have great quantity prisoner board see great many boom have time compliment 
5,"""That is very true,"" replied Mr. Campbell, ""we must wait till we arrive at Quebec.""",true reply wait arrive 
6,"""But we did not see Alfred,"" said Emma.",see say 
7,"""No, miss, because he was busy enough below, and I dare say no one told him. They have said that all's well, and that is sufficient; and now we must haul off again, for with such a heavy ship in tow, Captain Lumley will not thank me if I am always coming so close to him.""",miss busy say tell say well sufficient haul heavy ship tow thank come 
8,"""I am satisfied, Captain Wilson; pray do nothing that might displease Captain Lumley. We shall soon see Alfred, I dare say, with the spy-glass.""",satisfied pray do displease see say spy glass

10,"""Thank God,"" replied Mrs. Campbell; ""now I am satisfied.""",thank reply satisfied 
11,"The Portsmouth cast off the French line-of-battle ship, as soon as they had jury-masts up and could make sail on them, and the convoy proceeded to the mouth of the St. Lawrence.",cast french line battle ship have jury mast make sail convoy proceed mouth 
12,"""Captain Wilson,"" said Percival, whose eyes were fixed on the water, ""what animals are those, tumbling about and blowing,--those great white things?""",say eye fix water animal tumble blow great white thing 
13,"""They are what are called the white whale, Percival,"" replied Captain Wilson; ""they are not often seen, except about here.""",call white whale reply see

15,"""The northern whales are black--they are called the black whales; but the southern, or spermaceti whales, are not so dark in color.""",northern whale black call black whale southern spermaceti whale dark color 
16,"Captain Wilson then, at Percival's request, gave him an account of how the whales were caught, for he had been several voyages himself in the northern whale fishery.",request give account whale catch several voyage northern whale fishery 
17,"Percival was never tired of asking questions, and Captain Wilson was very kind to him, and always answered him. John, generally speaking, stood by when Captain Wilson was talking, looking very solemn and very attentive, but not saying a word.",tired ask question kind answer speak stand talk look solemn attentive say word 
18,"""Well John,"" said Emma to him after the conversation had been ended, ""what was Captain Wilson telling you about?""",say conversation end tell

24,In three weeks from the day of the action they had anchored off the town of Quebec.,week day action anchore town 
25,"As soon as they had anchored, Alfred obtained leave to go on board of the London Merchant, and then, for the first time, his family knew that he had been wounded. His arm was still in a sling, but was healing fast.",anchore obtain leave go board first time family know wound arm sling heal 
26,"I shall pass over the numerous inquiries on his part, relative to their capture and recapture, and on theirs, as to the action with the French ship.",pass numerous inquiry part relative capture recapture action french ship 
27,"While they were in conversation, Captain Lumley was reported to be coming on board in his boat. They went on the deck of the vessel to receive him.",conversation report come board boat go deck vessel receive 
28,"""Well, Mrs. Campbell,"" said Captain Lumley after the first salutations were over, ""you must congratulate me on my having captured a vessel somewhat larger than my own; and I must congratulate you on the conduct and certain promotion of your son Alfred. He has richly deserved it.""",say first salutation congratulate capture vessel large own congratulate conduct certain promotion son deserve 
29,"""I am very thankful, Captain Lumley, and do most heartily congratulate you,"" replied Mrs. Campbell; ""I only regret that my boy has been wounded.""",thankful congratulate reply regret boy wound 
30,"""The very thing that you should, on the contrary, be thankful for, Mrs. Campbell,"" replied Captain Lumley. ""It is the most fortunate wound in the world, as it not only adds to his claims, but enables me to let him join you and go to Canada with you, without it being supposed that he has quitted the service.""",very thing contrary thankful reply fortunate wound world add claim enable let join go suppose quit service 
31,"""How so, Captain Lumley?""",
32,"""I can discharge him to sick-quarters here at Quebec. If they think any thing about it at all at home, it will be that his wound is much more severe than it really is; and he can remain on half-pay as long as he pleases. There are plenty ready to be employed. But I can not wait any longer. I am going on shore to call upon the Governor, and I thought I would just see you on my way. You may assure yourselves that if I can be of any use to you, I will not fail to exert any little influence I may have.""",discharge sick quarter think thing home wound severe remain half pay please be plenty ready employ wait go shore call think see way assure use fail exert little influence have 
33,"Captain Lumley then took a cordial leave of the whole party, telling Alfred that he might consider himself as discharged from the ship, and might rejoin his family.",take cordial leave whole party tell consider discharge ship rejoin family 
34,"""Heaven sends us friends when we most need them and least expect them,"" said Mrs. Campbell, as she watched the boat pulling away. ""Who would have imagined, when we anchored at Cork, that such good fortune should have awaited us; and that, at the very time Alfred had given up his profession for our sake, his promotion in the service was awaiting him?""",heaven send friend need least expect say watch boat pull imagine anchore such good fortune await very time give profession sake promotion service await 
35,"Shortly afterward Mrs. Campbell and Henry went on shore with Captain Wilson to look out for lodgings, and present the letters of introduction which he had received for some Quebec merchants. As they were looking for lodgings in company with a Mr. Farquhar, who had kindly volunteered to assist them, they met Captain Lumley on his return from the Governor.",go shore look lodging present letter introduction receive merchant look lodging company volunteer assist meet return 
36,"""I am glad to have met you, Mrs. Campbell,"" said Captain Lumley; ""I found on paying my respects to the Governor, that there is what they call the Admiralty House here, which is kept furnished by Government for the senior officers of his Majesty's ships. It is at my disposal; and as the Governor has requested me to take up my abode at Government House, I beg you will consider it at your service. You will find better accommodation there than in lodgings, and it will save you considerable expense.""",glad meet say find pay respect be call keep furnish senior officer ship disposal request take abode beg consider service find good accommodation lodging save considerable expense

40,"""To me, mother?--to Captain Lumley, I should rather think.""",mother think 
41,"""Yes, to Captain Lumley, I grant; but still it has been your good conduct when under his command which has made him attached to you; and it is to that we owe his acquaintance, and all the kindness we have received from him.""",grant good conduct command make attach owe acquaintance kindness receive 
42,"The next day the family disembarked and took possession of the Admiralty House. Mr. Farquhar procured them a female servant, who, with a man and his wife left in charge of the house, supplied all the attendance they required. Mrs. Campbell settled with Captain Wilson, who very generously refused to take any money for Alfred's passage, as he had not remained on board of the London Merchant: promising, however, to accept their invitation to come to them whenever he could find leisure, he took leave of them for the present, and they were left alone in their new residence.",next day family disembark take possession procure female servant man wife leave charge house supply attendance require settle refuse take money passage remain board promise accept invitation come find leisure take leave present leave alone new residence 
43,"In a few days the Campbells found themselves comfortably settled in the Admiralty House, but they had no intention of remaining there longer than was necessary; as, notwithstanding the accommodation, their residence at Quebec was attended with expense, and Mr. Campbell was aware that he had no money to throw away.",few day find settle have intention remain necessary notwithstand accommodation residence attend expense aware have money throw 
44,"On the fourth day after their landing Captain Lumley called to take leave; but the day previous he had introduced them to the Governor, who returned Mr. Campbell's call, and appeared to be much interested in their welfare, owing of course to the representations of Captain Lumley. It was not, therefore, surprising that they should part with regret from one who had proved himself such a kind friend; and many were the expressions of gratitude which were made by the whole party. Captain Lumley shook hands with them all; and, assuring Alfred that he would not lose sight of his interests, wished them every success, and left the house. An hour afterward the Portsmouth was under weigh, and running out with a fine breeze.",fourth day landing call take leave day previous introduce return call appear interested welfare ow course representation surprising part regret prove kind friend many expression gratitude make whole party shake hand assure lose sight interest wish success leave house hour weigh run fine breeze 
45,"On the following day the Governor requested Mr. Campbell would call upon him; and when they met, he pointed out to him that he would have great difficulties, and, he was fearful, great hardships, to encounter in following up his plan of settling in Upper Canada. He did not dissuade him from so doing, as he had nothing more promising to offer which might induce him to change his mind, but he thought it right to forewarn him of trials, that he might be well prepared.",follow day request call meet point have great difficulty fearful great hardship encounter follow plan settle upper dissuade do have promising offer induce change mind think right forewarn trial prepare 
46,"""I feel, of course, a strong interest in any English family so well brought up, and accustomed, as I find yours has been, to luxury, being placed in such a situation; and the interest which my old friend, Captain Lumley, takes in you, is quite sufficient to induce me to offer you every assistance in my power: that you may depend upon, Mr. Campbell. The Surveyor-General is coming here immediately, I must first introduce you to him, as it is from him that the land must be obtained, and of course he can advise you well on the point of locality; but you must recollect that it is not much more than thirty years since these provinces have been surrendered to Great Britain, and that not only the French population, but the Indians, are very hostile to the English, for the Indians were, and still are, firm allies to the French, and detest us. I have been reflecting upon the affair, and I hope to be of some service to you: if I am not, it will not, I assure you, be from any want of will; under every advantage which may be procured for you, at all events, you will require stout hearts and able hands. Your son Alfred will be of great service, but we must try and procure you some other assistance that can be trusted.""",feel course strong interest english family bring accustom find luxury place situation interest old friend take sufficient induce offer assistance power depend come introduce land obtain course advise point locality recollect more year province surrender great french population hostile firm ally detest reflect affair hope service assure want will advantage procure event require stout heart able hand son great service try procure other assistance trust 
47,"A long conversation then took place between the Governor and Mr. Campbell, during which the latter received much valuable information: it was interrupted, however, by the arrival of the Surveyor-General, and the topic was resumed.",long conversation take place latter receive much valuable information interrupt arrival topic resume 
48,"""The land that I would propose to Mr. Campbell,"" observed the Surveyor-General, after a time, ""if there is no objection to part with it, is a portion of what has been laid aside as Government reserve on this part of the Lake Ontario; there are lands to be obtained nearer to Montreal, but all the land of good quality has been purchased. This land, you will observe, Mr. Campbell, is peculiarly good, having some few acres of what we call prairie, or natural meadow. It has also the advantage of running with a large frontage on the beach, and there is a small river on one side of it; besides, it is not a great distance, perhaps four or five miles, from Fort Frontignac, and it might be easy to obtain assistance if required.""",land propose observe time be objection part portion lay government reserve part be land obtain land good quality purchase land observe good have few acre call prairie natural meadow have advantage run large frontage beach be small river side great distance mile easy obtain assistance require 
49,"The Surveyor-General pointed to a part of the map, near to Presqu' Ile de Quinte, as he made this observation to the Governor.",point part map make observation 
50,"""I agree with you,"" replied the Governor, ""and I observe that there is already a settler on the other side of the stream.""",agree reply observe be settler other side stream 
51,"""Yes, sir,"" replied the Surveyor; ""that allotment was granted before it was decided that the rest should be a Government reserve; and if proof were required of the goodness of the land, it would be found in the person who took it. It was taken four years ago by the old hunter, Malachi Bone; he has been over every part of it, of course, and knows what it is. You recollect the man, don't you, sir? He was a guide to the English army before the surrender of Quebec; General Wolfe had a high opinion of him, and his services were so good that he was allowed that tract of 150 acres.""",sir reply allotment grant decide rest government reserve proof require goodness land find person take take year old hunter part course know recollect man sir guide english army surrender have high opinion service good allow tract acre

53,"""It will be a great advantage to you, Mr. Campbell, having this man as a neighbor.""",great advantage have man neighbor 
54,"""Now,"" continued the Governor, addressing the Surveyor-General, ""do you know of any person who would be willing to serve Mr. Campbell, and who can be depended upon; of course one who understands the country, and who would be really useful?""",continue address know person willing serve depend course one understand country useful 
55,"""Yes, Governor, I do know a very good man, and you know him also; but you know the worst part of him, for he is generally in trouble when you see him.""",know good man know know bad part trouble see 
56,"""Who is that?""",
57,"""Martin Super, the trapper.""",trapper 
58,"""Why, that is the young fellow who breeds such disturbances, and who, if I recollect right, is now in prison for a riot.""",young fellow breed such disturbance recollect right prison riot 
59,"""The very same, sir; but Martin Super, although a troublesome fellow at Quebec, is worth his weight in gold when he is out of the town. You may think it strange, Mr. Campbell, that I should recommend a man who appears to be so unruly a character; but the fact is that the trappers, who go in pursuit of the game for their skins, after having been out for months, undergoing every privation that can be imagined, return home with their packages of skins, which they dispose of to the merchants of this town; and as soon as they have their money, they never cease their revelry of every description until their earnings are all gone, and then they set off again on their wild and venturous pursuit. Now Martin Super, like all the rest, must have his fun when he comes back, and being a very wild fellow, he is often in scrapes when he has drunk too much, so that he is occasionally put into prison for being riotous; but I know him well, he has been with me surveying for months, and when he is on service, a more steady, active, and brave man I do not know.""",same sir troublesome fellow worth weight gold town think strange recommend man appear unruly character fact trapper go pursuit game skin month undergo privation imagine return package skin dispose merchant town have money cease revelry description earnings gone set wild venturous pursuit rest have fun come wild fellow scrape drunk much put prison riotous know survey month service steady active brave man know 
60,"""I believe you are right in recommending him,"" observed the Governor, ""he will not be sorry to get out of the gaol, and I have no doubt but that he will conduct himself well if he once agrees to take your service, Mr. Campbell, for one or two years. As for the Canadians, they are very harmless, but at the same time very useful. There are exceptions, no doubt; but their general character is any thing but that of activity and courage. As I said before, you will require stout hearts, and Martin Super is one, that is certain. Perhaps you can arrange this for Mr. Campbell?""",believe right recommend observe sorry get gaol have doubt conduct agree take service year harmless same time useful be exception doubt general character thing activity courage say require stout heart certain arrange 
61,"The Surveyor-General promised to do so; shortly after which, Mr. Campbell, with many thanks, took his leave of the Governor.",promise do many thanks take leave 
62,"Mr. Campbell, who had gained every possible information relative to what would be most necessary for him to take with him, was actively employed for a fortnight in making his purchases. During this time much attention was shown to them both by the English and French residents at Quebec. Alfred, whose wound was now nearly healed, was as active as usual, and Henry was of great assistance to his father in taking inventories and making out lists, etc. Nor were Mrs. Campbell and the two girls unemployed; they had purchased the coarse manufactures of the country, and were very busy making dresses for themselves and for the children. Mr. Campbell had been one morning at Mr. Farquhar's, the merchant's, to make inquiries about a conveyance up to his new purchase (for he had concluded his arrangements with the Surveyor-General), when the Governor sent a message by one of his aides-de-camp, to say that it was his intention in the course of ten days to send a detachment of soldiers up to Fort Frontignac--news having been received that the garrison was weakened by a fever which had broken out; and that if Mr. Campbell would like to avail himself of the opportunity, he and his family, and all his luggage, should go under the escort of the officer and troops. The offer was of course joyfully accepted, and on Mr. Campbell's calling upon the Governor to return his thanks, the latter told him that there would be plenty of room in the _bateaux_ and canoes for them and all their luggage, and that he need not give himself further trouble, or incur any further expense.",gain possible information relative necessary take employ fortnight make purchase time much attention show english french resident wound healed active usual great assistance father take inventory make list etc. girl unemployed purchase coarse manufacture country busy make dress child morning merchant make inquiry conveyance new purchase conclude arrangement send message aide camp say intention course day send detachment soldier news receive garrison weaken fever break like avail opportunity family luggage go escort officer troops offer course accept call return thanks latter tell be plenty room _bateaux_ canoe luggage give further trouble incur further expense
