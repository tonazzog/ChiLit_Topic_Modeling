2,"Old Ready had his boat loaded and had made sail for the other side of the island long before the family were up; indeed, before they were dressed he had landed his whole cargo on the beach, and was sitting down quietly taking his breakfast.  As soon as he had eaten the beef and biscuit which he had taken with him, he carried up the things which he had brought, and commenced arrangements for setting up the tent, intending to await the arrival of William and Juno, that they might assist him in getting up the spars and canvas over it.",old ready have boat load make sail other side island family dress land whole cargo beach sit take breakfast eat beef biscuit take carry thing bring commence arrangement set tent intend await arrival assist get spar canvas
