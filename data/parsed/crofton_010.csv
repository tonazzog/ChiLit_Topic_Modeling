2,"Though Mr Tooke was so busy from having no usher, he found time to come and see Hugh pretty often.  He had a sofa moved into that room: and he carried Hugh, without hurting him at all, and laid him down there comfortably, beside the fire.  He took his tea there, with Mrs Proctor; and he brought up his newspaper, and read from it anything which he thought would amuse the boy.  He smiled at Hugh's scruple about occupying his room, and assured him that he was quite as well off in Mr Carnaby's room, except that it was not so quiet as this, and therefore more fit for a person in health than for an invalid.  Mr Tooke not only brought up plenty of books from the school library, but lent Hugh some valuable volumes of prints from his own shelves.",busy have usher find time come see have sofa move room carry hurt lay fire take tea bring newspaper read think amuse boy smile scruple occupy room assure room quiet fit person health invalid bring plenty book school library loan valuable volume print own shelf 
3,"Hugh could not look at these for long together.  His head soon began to ache, and his eyes to be dazzled; for he was a good deal weakened.  His mother observed also that he became too eager about views in foreign countries, and that he even grew impatient in his temper when talking about them.",look head begin ache eye dazzle good deal weaken mother observe become eager view foreign country grow impatient temper talk

6,"""If it is a pleasure, go on.  I was afraid it was becoming a pain.""",pleasure go afraid become pain 
7,"Mr Tooke did not ask what this meant; but he evidently wished to know. He soon knew, for Hugh found himself growing more fidgety and more cross, the further he looked in the volume of Indian Views, till he threw himself back upon the sofa, and stuffed his handkerchief into his mouth, and stared at the fire, struggling, as his mother saw, to help crying.  ""I will take away the book,--shall I, my dear?""",ask mean wish know know find grow fidgety cross further look volume indian throw sofa stuff handkerchief mouth stare fire struggle mother see help cry take book dear 
8,"""Yes, mother.  O dear!  I shall never keep my vow, I know.""",mother dear keep vow know 
9,"Mrs Proctor told Mr Tooke that Hugh had made a resolution which she earnestly hoped he might be able to keep;--to bear cheerfully every disappointment and trouble caused by this accident, from the greatest to the least,--from being obliged to give up being a traveller by-and-by, to the shoemaker's wondering that he wanted only one shoe.  Now, if looking at pictures of foreign countries made him less cheerful, it seemed to belong to his resolution to give up that pleasure for the present.  Hugh acknowledged that it did; and Mr Tooke, who was pleased at what he heard, carried away the Indian Views, and brought instead a very fine work on Trades, full of plates representing people engaged in every kind of trade and manufacture.  Hugh was too tired to turn over any more pages to-night: but his master said the book might stay in the room now, and when Hugh was removed, it might go with him; and, as he was able to sit up more, he might like to copy some of the plates.",tell make resolution hope able keep bear disappointment trouble cause accident great least oblige give traveller shoemaker wonder want shoe look picture foreign country make cheerful seem belong resolution give pleasure present acknowledge pleased hear carry indian bring fine work full plate represent person engage kind trade manufacture tired turn more page night master say book stay room remove go able sit like copy plate

18,"""But how in the world shall I get there?"" he presently asked.  ""It is two whole miles; and we can't lay my leg up in the gig: besides its being so cold.""",world get ask whole mile lay leg gig cold 
19,"His mother told him that his uncle had a very nice plan for his conveyance.  Mr Annanby approved of it, and thought he might be moved the first sunny day.",mother tell uncle have nice plan conveyance approve think move first sunny day 
20,"""What, to-morrow?""",

22,"Mr Tooke unbolted the shutter, and declared that it was such a bright starry evening that he thought to-morrow would be fine.",unbolt shutter declare bright starry evening think fine 
23,"The morning was fine; and during the very finest part of it came Mr Shaw.  He told Hugh that there was a good fire blazing at home in the back room that looked into the garden, which was to be Hugh's.  From the sofa by the fire-side one might see the laurustinus on the grass-plot,-- now covered with flowers: and when the day was warm enough to let him lie in the window, he could see the mill, and all that was going on round it.",morning fine fine part come tell be good fire blaze home back room look garden sofa fire side see laurustinus grass plot cover flower day warm let lie window see mill go

37,"""Never mind about the holidays now.  Your holidays begin to-day.  You have nothing to do but to get well now, and make yourself at home at my house, and be merry with Agnes.  Now shall we go, while the sun shines? Here is your mother all cloaked up in her warm things.""",mind holiday holiday begin day have do get make home house merry go sun shine mother cloak warm thing 
38,"""O, mother!  Agnes is come,"" cried Hugh.",mother come cry 
39,"This was no news; for it was his mother who had guessed what companion he would like to have.  She now showed her large warm cloak, in which Hugh was to be wrapped; and his neck was muffled up in a comforter.",news mother guess companion like have show large warm cloak wrap neck muffle comforter

41,"""Quietly in your bed,"" said his uncle.  ""Come, I will lift you into it.""",bed say uncle come lift 
42,"And his uncle carried him down-stairs to the front door, where two of Mr Shaw's men stood with a litter, which was slung upon poles, and carried like a sedan-chair.  There was a mattress upon the litter, on which Hugh lay as comfortably as on a sofa.  He said it was like being carried in a palanquin in India,--if only there was hot sunshine, and no frost and snow.",uncle carry stair front door man stand litter sling pole carry sedan chair be mattress litter lay sofa say carry palanquin be hot sunshine frost snow 
43,"Mr Tooke, and Mrs Watson, and Firth shook hands with Hugh, and said they should be glad to see him back again: and Mr Tooke added that some of the boys should visit him pretty often till the breaking-up.  Nobody else was allowed to come quite near; but the boys clustered at that side of the playground, to see as much as they could.  Hugh waved his hand; and every boy saw it; and in a moment every hat and cap was off, and the boys gave three cheers,--the loudest that had ever been heard at Crofton.  The most surprising thing was that Mr Tooke cheered, and Mr Shaw too.  The men looked as if they would have liked to set down the litter, and cheer too: but they did not quite do that.  They only smiled as if they were pleased.",shake hand say glad see add boy visit breaking else allow come boy cluster side playground see much wave hand boy see moment hat cap boy give cheer loudest hear surprising thing cheer man look like set litter cheer do smile pleased 
44,"There was one person besides who did not cheer.  Tooke stood apart from the other boys, looking very sad.  As the litter went down the by-road, he began to walk away; but Hugh begged the men to stop, and called to Tooke.  Tooke turned: and when Hugh beckoned, he forgot all about bounds, leaped the paling, and came running.  Hugh said,--",be person cheer stand other boy look sad litter go road begin walk begg man stop call turn beckon forget bound leap paling come run say 
45,"""I have been wanting to see you so!  But I did not like to ask for you particularly.""",want see like ask

49,"""Oh, you may, I know.""",know 
50,"""Well, I will, thank you.  Good-bye.""",thank good bye 
51,"And on went the litter, with Mrs Proctor and Mr Shaw walking beside it.  The motion did not hurt Hugh at all; and he was so warmly wrapped up, and the day so fine, that he was almost sorry when the two miles were over.  And yet there was Agnes out upon the steps; and she sat beside him on the sofa in his cheerful room, and told him that she had nothing to do but to wait on him, and play with him.  She did not tell him yet that she must learn directly to nurse him, and, with her aunt's help, fill her mother's place, because her mother was much wanted at home: but this was in truth one chief reason for her coming.",go litter walk motion hurt wrap day fine sorry mile be step sit sofa cheerful room tell have do wait play tell learn nurse aunt help fill mother place mother want home truth chief reason come 
52,"Though there was now really nothing the matter with Hugh--though he ate, drank, slept, and gained strength--his mother would not leave him till she saw him well able to go about.",be matter eat drink sleep gain strength mother leave see able go 
53,"The carpenter soon came, with some crutches he had borrowed for Hugh to try; and when they were sure of the right length, Hugh had a new pair. He found it rather nervous work at first, using them; and he afterwards laughed at the caution with which he began.  First, he had somebody to lift him from his seat, and hold him till he was firm on his crutches. Then he carefully moved forwards one crutch at a time, and then the other; and he put so much strength into it, that he was quite tired when he had been once across the room and back again.  Every stumble made him shake all over.  He made Agnes try; and he was almost provoked to see how lightly she could hop about; but then, as he said, she could put a second foot down to save herself, whenever she pleased.  Every day, however, walking became easier to him; and he even discovered, when accidentally left alone, and wanting something from the opposite end of the room, that he could rise, and set forth by himself, and be independent.  And in one of these excursions it was that he found the truth of what Agnes had told him--how much easier it was to move both crutches together.  When he showed his mother this, she said she thought he would soon learn to do with only one.",carpenter come crutch borrow try sure right length have new pair find nervous work use laugh caution begin have lift seat hold firm crutch move forward crutch time other put much strength tired room stumble make shake make try provoke see hop say put second foot save pleased day walking become easy discover leave want opposite end room rise set independent excursion find truth tell easy move crutch show mother say think learn do 
54,"Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes--such as no one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity as they deserved.  A surprise of this sort happened to him the evening before his father was to come to see him, and to fetch away his mother.",find subject painful feeling such understand such fear able pity deserve surprise sort happen evening father come see fetch mother 
55,"It was the dark hour in the afternoon--the hour when Mrs Proctor and her children enjoyed every day a quiet talk, before Mr Shaw came to carry Hugh into his aunt's parlour to tea.  Nothing could be merrier than Hugh had been; and his mother and Agnes were chatting, when they thought they heard a sob from the sofa.  They spoke to Hugh, and found that he was indeed crying bitterly.",dark hour afternoon hour child enjoy day quiet talk come carry aunt parlour tea merrier mother chat think hear sob sofa speak find cry 
56,"""What is it, my dear?"" said his mother.  ""Agnes, have we said anything that could hurt him?""",dear say mother say hurt 
57,"""No, no,"" sobbed Hugh.  ""I will tell you presently.""",sobb tell 
58,"And presently he told them that he was so busy listening to what they said, that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if something had got between two of his toes; unconsciously he put his hand down; and his foot was not there!  Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his toes: and, then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so terrible--it startled him so.",tell busy listen say forget else feel get toe put hand foot plainer feeling toe put hand find terrible startle 
59,"It was a comfort to him to find that his mother knew all about this. She came and kneeled beside his sofa, and told him that many persons who had lost a limb considered this odd feeling the most painful thing they had to bear for some time; but that, though the feeling would return occasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.  When he had become so used to do without his foot as to leave off wanting or wishing for it, he would perhaps make a joke of the feeling, instead of being disappointed.  At least she knew that some persons did so who had lost a limb.",comfort find mother know come kneel sofa tell many person lose limb consider odd feeling painful thing have bear time feeling return life cease painful become use do foot leave want wish make joke feeling disappoint least know person lose limb 
60,"This did not comfort Hugh much, for every prospect had suddenly become darkened.  He said he did not know how he should bear his misfortune;-- he was pretty sure he could not bear it.  It seemed so long already since it had happened!  And when he thought of the long long days, and months, and years, to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play, and never be like other people, and never able to do the commonest things without labour and trouble, he wished he was dead.  He had rather have died.",comfort much prospect become darken say know bear misfortune sure bear seem happen think long long day month year end life run play other person able do commonest thing labour trouble wish dead die 
61,"Agnes thought he must be miserable indeed, if he could venture to say this to his mother.  She glanced at her mother's face; but there was no displeasure there.  Mrs Proctor said this feeling was very natural. She had felt it herself, under smaller misfortunes than Hugh's; but she had found that, though the prospect appears all strewn with troubles, they come singly, and are not worth minding, after all.  She told Hugh that, when she was a little girl, very lazy--fond of her bed--fond of her book--and not at all fond of washing and dressing--",think miserable venture say mother glance mother face be displeasure say feeling natural feel small misfortune find prospect appear strewn trouble come worth mind tell little girl lazy fond bed fond book fond washing dress 
62,"""Why, mother, you!"" exclaimed Hugh.",mother exclaim 
63,"""Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was.  Well, I was in despair, one day, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth, and brush my hair, and put on every daily article of dress every morning, as long as I lived.  There was nothing I disliked so much; and yet it was the thing that must be done every day of my whole life.""",sort little girl despair day thought have wash clean tooth brush hair put daily article dress morning live be dislike thing do day whole life 
64,"""Did you tell anybody?"" asked Hugh.",tell ask 
65,"""No; I was ashamed to do that: but I remember I cried.  You see how it turns out.  Grown people, who have got to do everything by habit, so easily as not to think about it, wash and dress every morning, without ever being weary of it.  We do not consider so much as once a year what we are doing at dressing-time, though at seven years old it is a very laborious and tiresome affair to get ready for breakfast.""",ashamed do remember cry see turn grow person get do habit think wash dress morning weary consider much year do dress time year old laborious tiresome affair get ready breakfast 
66,"""It is the same about writing letters,"" observed Agnes.  ""The first letter I ever wrote was to Aunt Shaw; and it took so long, and was so tiresome, that, when I thought of all the exercises I should have to write for Miss Harold, and all the letters that I must send to my relations when I grew up, I would have given everything I had in the world not to have learned to write.  Oh!  How I pitied papa, when I saw sometimes the pile of letters that were lying to go to the post!""",same writing letter observe first letter write take tiresome think exercise have write letter send relation grow give have world learn write pity papa see pile letter lie go post 
67,"""And how do you like corresponding with Phil now?""",like corresponding 
68,"Agnes owned, with blushes, that she still dreaded the task for some days before, and felt particularly gay when it was done.  Her mother believed that, if infants could think and look forward, they would be far more terrified with the prospect of having to walk on their two legs all their lives, than lame people could be at having to learn the art in part over again.  Grown people are apt to doubt whether they can learn a new language, though children make no difficulty about it: the reason of which is, that grown people see at one view the whole labour, while children do not look beyond their daily task.  Experience, however, always brings relief.  Experience shows that every effort comes at its proper time, and that there is variety or rest in the intervals.  People who have to wash and dress every morning have other things to do in the after part of the day; and, as the old fable tells us, the clock that has to tick, before it is worn out, so many millions of times, as it perplexes the mind to think of, has exactly the same number of seconds to do it in; so that it never has more work on its hands than it can get through.  So Hugh would find that he could move about on each separate occasion, as he wanted; and practice would, in time, enable him to do it without any more thought than it now cost him to put all the bones of his hands in order, so as to carry his tea and bread-and-butter to his mouth.",own blush dread task day feel gay do mother believe infant think look terrified prospect have walk leg life lame person have learn art part grow person apt doubt learn new language child make difficulty reason grow person see view whole labour child look daily task experience bring relief experience show effort come proper time be variety rest interval person have wash dress morning have other thing do part day old fable tell clock have tick wear many million time perplex mind think have same number second do have more work hand get find move separate occasion want practice time enable do more thought cost put bone hand order carry tea bread butter mouth 
69,"""But that is not all--nor half what I mean,"" said Hugh.  ""No, my dear; nor half what you will have to make up your mind to bear.  You will have a great deal to bear, Hugh.  You resolved to bear it all patiently, I remember: but what is it that you dread the most?""",half mean say dear half have make mind bear have great deal bear resolve bear remember dread most

72,"""Oh!  Mamma!"" cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and the thought in her mind that it was cruel to talk so.",cry tear eye thought mind cruel talk 
73,"""Go on!  Go on!"" cried Hugh, brightening.  ""You know what I feel, mother; and you don't keep telling me, as Aunt Shaw does (and even Agnes sometimes), that it wont signify much, and that I shall not care, and all that; making out that it is no misfortune hardly, when I know what it is, and they don't.""",go go cry brighten know feel mother keep tell signify much care make misfortune know 
74,"""That is a common way of trying to give comfort, and it is kindly meant,"" said Mrs Proctor.  ""But those who have suffered much themselves know a better way.  The best way is not to deny any of the trouble or the sorrow, and not to press on the sufferer any comforts which he cannot now see and enjoy.  If comforts arise, he will enjoy them as they come.""",common way try give comfort mean say suffer much know good way good way deny trouble sorrow press sufferer comfort see enjoy comfort arise enjoy come
