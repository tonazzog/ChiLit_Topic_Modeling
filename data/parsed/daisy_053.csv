12,"“Come, Ethel, it is much better than the bazaar--it is no field for vanity.”",come good bazaar field vanity 
13,"“Certainly not,” said Ethel. “What a mess every one will make! Oh, if I could but stay away, like Harry! There will be Dr. Hoxton being sonorous and prosy, and Mr. Lake will stammer, and that will be nothing to the misery of our own people’s work. George will flounder, and look at Flora, and she will sit with her eyes on the ground, and Dr. Spencer will come out of his proper self, and be complimentary to people who deserve it no more!--And Norman!

15,"“Richard thinks Norman can do anything he can’t do himself! It is all chance--he may do very well, if he gets into his ‘funny state’, but he always suffers for that, and he will certainly put one into an agony at the outset. I wish Dr. Spencer would have let him alone! And then there will be that Sir Henry, whom I can’t abide!

She did not seem to have made it a mere geographical lesson, like Fanny Grigg--”",talk think school child enter tell answer hymn icy mountain seem make mere geographical lesson 
18,"Ethel’s misanthropy was happily conducted off via the Cocksmoor children, and any lingering remains were dissipated by her amusement at Dr. Spencer’s ecstasy on seeing Dr. May assume his red robe of office, to go to the minster in state, with the Town Council. He walked round and round his friend, called him Nicholas Randall redivivus, quoted Dogberry, and affronted Gertrude, who had a dim idea that he was making game of papa.",misanthropy conduct child linger remains dissipate amusement ecstasy see assume red robe office go minster state walk friend call redivivus quote affront have dim idea make game papa 
19,"Ethel was one of those to whom representation was such a penance, that a festival, necessitating hospitality to guests of her own rank, was burden enough seriously to disturb the repose of thankfulness for the attainment of her object, and to render difficult the recueillement which she needed for the praise and prayer that she felt due from her, and which seemed to oppress her heart, by a sense of inadequacy of her partial expression. It was well for her that the day began with the calm service in the minster, where it was her own fault if cares haunted her, and she could confess the sin of her irritated sensations, and wishes to have all her own way, and then, as ever, be led aright into thanksgiving for the unlooked-for crowning of her labours.",representation penance festival necessitate hospitality guest own rank burden disturb repose thankfulness attainment object render difficult recueillement need praise prayer feel due seem oppress heart sense inadequacy partial expression day begin calm service minster own fault care haunt confess sin irritated sensation wish have own way lead thanksgiving unlooked crowning labour 
20,"The archdeacon’s sermon amplified what Margaret had that morning expressed, so as to carry on her sense of appropriateness in the offerings of the day being bestowed on distant lands.",archdeacon sermon amplify have morning express carry sense appropriateness offering day bestow distant land 
21,"But the ordeal was yet to come, and though blaming herself, she was anything but comfortable, as the world repaired to the Town Hall, the room where the same faces so often met for such diverse purposes--now an orrery displayed by a conceited lecturer, now a ball, now a magistrates’ meeting, a concert or a poultry show, where rival Hamburg and Dorking uplifted their voices in the places of Mario and Grisi, all beneath the benignant portrait of Nicholas Randall, ruffed, robed, square-toed, his endowment of the scholarship in his hand, and a chequered pavement at his feet.",ordeal come blame comfortable world repair room same face meet such diverse purpose orrery display conceited lecturer ball magistrate meeting concert poultry show rival uplift voice place benignant portrait ruffed robed square teed endowment scholarship hand chequer pavement foot 
22,"Who knows not an S. P. G. meeting?--the gaiety of the serious, and the first public spectacle to the young, who, like Blanche and Aubrey, gaze with admiration at the rows of bonnets, and with awe at the black coats on the platform, while the relations of the said black coats suffer, like Ethel, from nervous dread of the public speaking of their best friends.",know meeting gaiety serious first public spectacle young gaze admiration row bonnet awe black coat platform relation say black coat suffer nervous dread public speak good friend 
23,"Her expectations were realised by the archdeacon’s speech, which went round in a circle, as if he could not find his way out of it. Lord Cosham was fluent, but a great many words went to very small substance; and no wonder, thought Ethel, when all they had to propose and second was the obvious fact that missions were very good things.",expectation realise archdeacon speech go circle find way fluent great many word go small substance wonder think have propose obvious fact mission good thing 
24,"Dr. Hoxton pompously, Sir Henry Walkinghame creditably, assisted the ladies and gentlemen to resolve that the S. P. G. wanted help; Mr. Lake made a stammering, and Mr. Rivers, with his good-natured face, hearty manner, and good voice, came in well after him with a straightforward, speech, so brief, that Ethel gave Flora credit for the best she had yet heard.",assist lady gentleman resolve want help make stammering good natured face hearty manner good voice come straightforward speech brief give credit good hear 
25,"Mr. Wilmot said something which the sharpest ears in the front row might, perhaps, have heard, and which resulted in Dr. Spencer standing up. Ethel hardly would have known who was speaking had her eyes been shut. His voice was so different, when raised and pitched, so as to show its power and sweetness; the fine polish of his manner was redoubled, and every sentence had the most graceful turn. It was like listening to a well-written book, so smooth and so fluent, and yet so earnest--his pictures of Indian life so beautiful, and his strong affection for the converts he described now and then making his eyes fill, and his voice falter, as if losing the thread of his studied composition--a true and dignified work of art, that made Dr. May whisper to Flora, “You see what he can do. They would have given anything to have had him for a lecturer.”",say sharp ear front row hear result stand know speak eye shut voice different raise pitch show power sweetness fine polish manner redoubl sentence have graceful turn listen write book smooth fluent earnest picture indian life beautiful strong affection convert describe make eye fill voice falter lose thread study composition true dignified work art make whisper see do give have lecturer 
26,"With half a sigh, Ethel saw Norman rise, and step forward. He began, with eyes fixed on the ground, and in a low modest tone, to speak of the islands that Harry had visited; but gradually the poetic nature, inherent in him, gained the mastery; and though his language was strikingly simple, in contrast with Dr. Spencer’s ornate periods, and free from all trace of “the lamp,” it rose in beauty and fervour at every sentence. The feelings that had decided his lot gave energy to his discourse, and repressed as they had been by reserve and diffidence, now flowed forth, and gave earnestness to natural gifts of eloquence of the highest order. After his quiet, unobtrusive beginning, there was the more wonder to find how he seemed to raise up the audience with him, in breathless attention, as to a strain of sweet music, carrying them without thought of the scene, or of the speaker, to the lovely isles, and the inhabitants of noble promise, but withering for lack of knowledge; and finally closing his speech, when they were wrought up to the highest pitch, by an appeal that touched them all home; “for well did he know,” said he, “that the universal brotherhood was drawn closest in circles nearer home, that beneath the shadow of their own old minster, gladness and mourning floated alike for all; and that all those who had shared in the welcome to one, given back as it were from the grave, would own the same debt of gratitude to the hospitable islanders.”",sigh see rise step begin eye fix ground low modest tone speak island visit poetic nature inherent gain mastery language simple contrast ornate period free trace lamp rise beauty fervour sentence feeling decide lot give energy discourse repress reserve diffidence flow give earnestness natural gift eloquence high order quiet unobtrusive beginning be more wonder find seem raise audience breathless attention strain sweet music carry thought scene speaker lovely isle inhabitant noble promise wither lack knowledge close speech wring high pitch appeal touch know say universal brotherhood draw close circle home shadow own old minster gladness mourn float share welcome give grave own same debt gratitude hospitable islander 
27,"He ceased. His father wiped his spectacles, and almost audibly murmured, “Bless him!” Ethel, who had sat like one enchanted, forgetting who spoke, forgetting all save the islanders, half turned, and met Richard’s smiling eyes, and his whisper, “I told you so.”",cease father wipe spectacle murmure bless sit enchanted forget speak forget islander half turn meet smile eye whisper tell

38,"Margaret pitied her sisters, but heard that all was going well; that Flora was taking care of the elders, and Harry and Mary were making the younger fry very merry at the table on the lawn. Dr. May had to start early to see a sick gardener at Drydale before coming on to Cocksmoor, and came up to give his daughter a few minutes.",pity sister hear go take care elder make young fry merry table lawn have start see sick gardener come come give daughter few minute 
39,"“We get on famously,” he said. “Ethel does well when she is in for it, like Norman. I had no notion what was in the lad. They are perfectly amazed with his speech.

52,"He took a passing glimpse at his neck-tie, screwed up the nap of his glossy hat to the perfection of its central point, armed himself with a knowing little stick, and hurried his fair companion out by the back door, as much afraid of losing the glory of being her sole protector as she was of falling in with an escort of as much consequence, in other eyes, as was Mr. Thomas in his own.",take pass glimpse neck tie screw nap glossy hat perfection central point arm know little stick hurry fair companion back door afraid lose glory sole protector fall escort much consequence other eye own

Besides, think of the numbers and numbers that he takes nothing from; and oh! to how many he has brought the most real good, when they would have shut their doors against it in any other form!
