9,"""No such rebellion was ever heard of before,"" said the squirrel, ""there is nothing like it in history; I know, for I've often slipped into the owl's muniment room (between you and me) on the sly, and taken a peep at his ancient documents.

11,"""Gentlemen,"" shouted the woodpecker, rushing up breathless with haste, ""I am sent round to tell you from the dictator that you can now proceed to the election of a king without fear of any kind, for he will keep the enemy employed should they appear, and he will over-awe the two pretenders, Ki Ki and Kauc.

12,"Immediately afterwards the owl, blundering in the daylight, came past and said that they had better come on to his house, for he had just had a private interview with the Khan, and had orders to preside over this business. So Bevis and the squirrel, the hare and the two jays proceeded to the pollard-tree; there was no need for Bevis to hide now, because he was recognised as a great friend of the squirrel's and the enemy of the weasel. A noisy crowd had already collected, which was augmented every minute, and there was a good deal of rough pushing and loud talking, not unmingled with blows. They were all there (except the weasel), the goldfinch, the tomtit, the chaffinch, the thrush, the blackbird, the missel-thrush, all of them, jays, the alien pigeons, doves, woodpeckers, the rat, the mouse, the stoat, and the fox.",owl blunder daylight come say come house have private interview have order preside business squirrel hare jay proceed pollard tree be need hide recognise great friend squirrel enemy weasel noisy crowd collect augment minute be good deal rough push loud talking unmingle blow weasel goldfinch tomtit chaffinch thrush blackbird missel thrush jay alien pigeon dove woodpecker rat mouse stoat fox 
13,"As the crowd increased, so did the uproar, till the owl appeared at the balcony of his mansion, and the woodpecker called for silence. The owl, when he could get a hearing, said they were all to give their opinions and say who they would have for their king. And that there might be less confusion he would call upon the least of them in size and the youngest in age to speak first, and so on upwards to the oldest and biggest.",crowd increase do uproar owl appear balcony mansion woodpecker call silence owl get hearing say give opinion say have king be less confusion call least size young age speak old big

34,"""There's one thing _I_ want to say,"" said Bevis, frowning, and looking very severe, as he stamped his foot. ""I have made up my mind on one point.

37,"At this the owl, immensely delighted, made Sir Bevis a profound bow, and begged to observe that one thing seemed to have escaped the notice of the ladies and gentlemen whom he saw around him. It was true they were all of noble blood, and many of them could claim a descent through countless generations. But they had overlooked the fact that, noble as they were, there was among them one with still higher claims; one who had royal blood in his veins, whose ancestors had been kings, and kings of high renown. He alluded to the fox.",owl delight make profound bow begg observe thing seem escape notice lady gentleman see true noble blood many claim descent countless generation overlook fact noble be high claim have royal blood vein ancestor king king high renown allude fox 
38,"At this the fox, who had not hitherto spoken, and kept rather in the background, modestly bent his head, and looked the other way.",fox speak keep background bend head look other way

41,"""Quite out of the question,"" said the goldfinch.",question say goldfinch 
42,"""Out of the running,"" said the hare.",running say hare 
43,"""Absurd,"" said the jay; and they all raised a clamour, protesting that even to mention the fox was to waste the public time.",absurd say jay raise clamour protest mention fox waste public time 
44,"""I am not so sure of that,"" muttered Cloctaw. ""We might do worse; I should not object."" But his remark was unheeded by all save the fox, whose quick ear caught it.",sure mutter do bad object remark unheeded save fox quick ear catch 
45,"Again there was a great clamour and uproar, and not a word could be heard, and again Bevis had to lift up his cannon-stick. Just then Ah Kurroo Khan sent a starling to know if they had finished, because Choo Hoo had quitted his camp, and his outposts were not a mile off.",be great clamour uproar word hear have lift can stick send starling know finish quit camp outpost mile 
46,"""In that case,"" said the owl, ""our best course will be to stop further discussion, and to put the matter to the test of the vote at once. ('Hear, hear.') Do you then all stand off a good way, so that no one shall be afraid to do as he chooses, and then come to me one at a time, beginning with the wren (as she spoke first), and let each tell me who he or she votes for, and the reason why, and then I will announce the result.""",case say owl good course stop further discussion put matter test vote hear hear stand good way afraid do choose come time begin wren speak let tell vote reason announce result 
47,"So they all stood off a good way, except Sir Bevis, who came closer to the pollard to hear what the voters said, and to see that all was done fairly. When all was ready the owl beckoned to the wren, and the wren flew up and whispered: ""I vote for the fox because Te-te shall not have the crown"".",stand good way come close pollard hear voter say see do ready owl beckon wren wren fly whisper vote fox have crown 
48,"Next came Te-te, and he said: ""I vote for the fox because the wren shall not have it"".",come say vote fox wren have 
49,"Then Tchink, who said he voted for the fox so that the goldfinch should not have the throne.",say vote fox goldfinch have throne 
50,"The goldfinch voted for the fox that the yellow-hammer should not have it, and the yellow-hammer because the goldfinch should not succeed. The jay did the same because Tchack-tchack should not have it; the dove because the pigeon should not have it; the blackbird to oust the thrush, and the thrush to stop the blackbird; the sparrow to stop the starling, and the starling to stop the sparrow; the woodpecker to stop the kingfisher, and the kingfisher to stop the woodpecker; and so on all through the list, all voting for the fox in succession, to checkmate their friends' ambition, down to Cloctaw, who said he voted for the fox because he knew he could not get the throne himself, and considered the fox better than the others. Lastly, the owl, seeing that Reynard had got the election (which indeed he had anticipated when he called attention to the modest fox), also voted for him.",goldfinch vote fox yellow hammer have yellow hammer goldfinch succeed jay same have dove pigeon have blackbird oust thrush thrush stop blackbird sparrow stop starling starling stop sparrow woodpecker stop kingfisher kingfisher stop woodpecker list voting fox succession checkmate friend ambition say vote fox know get throne consider fox good other owl see get election anticipate call attention modest fox vote 
51,"Then he called the fox forward, and was about to tell him that he was duly elected, and would sit on a throne firmly fixed upon the wide base of a universal plebiscite, when Eric, the missel-thrush (who had taken no part in the proceedings, for he alone regretted Kapchack), cried out that the fox ought to be asked to show some proof of ability before he received the crown. This was so reasonable that every one endorsed it; and the missel-thrush, seeing that he had made an impression, determined to set the fox the hardest task he could think of, and said that as it was the peculiar privilege of a monarch to protect his people, so the fox, before he mounted the throne, ought to be called upon to devise some effectual means of repelling the onslaught of Choo Hoo.",call fox about tell elect sit throne fix wide base universal plebiscite missel thrush take part proceedings regret cry fox ask show proof ability receive crown reasonable one endors missel thrush see make impression determined set fox hard task think say peculiar privilege monarch protect person fox mount throne call devise effectual means repell onslaught 
52,"""Hear, hear!"" shouted the assembly, and cried with one voice upon the fox to get them out of the difficulty, and save them from the barbarian horde.",hear hear shout assembly cry voice fox get difficulty save barbarian horde 
53,"The fox was in the deepest bewilderment, but he carefully concealed his perplexity, and looked down upon the ground as if pondering profoundly, whereas he really had not got the least idea what to do. There was silence. Every one waited for the fox.",fox deep bewilderment conceal perplexity look ground ponder get least idea do be silence one wait fox 
54,"""Ahem!"" said Cloctaw, as if clearing his throat.",say clear throat 
55,"The fox detected his meaning, and slyly glanced towards him, when Cloctaw looked at Bevis and winked. Instantly the fox took the hint (afterwards claiming the idea as entirely his own), and lifting his head, said:--",fox detect meaning glance look wink fox take hint claim idea own lift head say 
56,"""Ladies and gentlemen, you have indeed set me a most difficult task--so difficult, that should I succeed in solving this problem, I hope shall obtain your complete confidence. Gentlemen, we have amongst us at this moment a visitor, and one whom we all delight to honour, the more especially as we know him to be the determined foe of that mercenary scoundrel the weasel, who, should I be so fortunate as to obtain the crown, shall, I promise you, never set foot in my palace--I allude to the friend of the squirrel and the hare--I allude to Sir Bevis. ('Hear, hear! Hurrah for little Sir Bevis! Three cheers more!') I see that you respond with enthusiasm to the sentiment I have expressed.

57,"""He carries in his hand an instrument in which the ignition of certain chemical substances causes an alarming report, and projects a shower of formidable missiles to a distance. This instrument, which I hear he constructed himself, thereby displaying unparalleled ingenuity, he calls his cannon-stick. Now if we could persuade him to become our ally, and to bang off his cannon-stick when Choo Hoo comes, I think we should soon see the enemy in full retreat, when the noble dictator, Ah Kurroo Khan, could pursue, and add another to his already lengthy list of brilliant achievements. I would therefore propose, with the utmost humility, that Sir Bevis be asked to receive a deputation; and I would, with your permission, nominate the hare, the squirrel, and Cloctaw as the three persons best able to convey your wishes.""",carry hand instrument ignition certain chemical substance cause alarming report project shower formidable missile distance instrument hear construct display unparalleled ingenuity call -stick persuade become ally bang stick come think see enemy full retreat noble dictator pursue add lengthy list brilliant achievement propose utmost humility ask receive deputation permission nominate hare squirrel person able convey wish 
58,"At this address there was a general buzz of admiration; people whispered to each other that really the fox was extraordinarily clever, and well worthy to ascend the throne--who would have thought that any one so retiring could have suggested so original, and yet at the same time so practical a course? The fox's idea was at once adopted. Bevis went back with the jay to his seat on the moss under the oak, and there sat down to receive the deputation.",address be general buzz admiration person whisper other fox clever worthy ascend throne think one retire suggest original same time practical course fox idea adopt go jay seat moss oak sit receive deputation 
59,"Just as it was about to set out, the fox begged permission to say one word more, which being readily granted, he asked if he might send a message by the starling to Ah Kurroo Khan. The present, he said, seemed a most favourable moment for destroying those dangerous pretenders, Ki Ki and Kauc. Usually their brigand retainers were scattered all over the country, miles and miles apart, and while thus separated it would require an immense army--larger than the state in the present exhausted condition of the treasury could afford to pay without fresh taxes--to hunt the robbers down in their woods and fastnesses. But they were now concentrated, and preparing no doubt for a raid upon the copse.",about set fox begg permission say word more grant ask send message starling present say seem favourable moment destroy dangerous pretender brigand retainer scatter country mile mile separate require immense army large state present exhaust condition treasury afford pay fresh tax hunt robber wood fastness concentrate prepare doubt raid copse 
60,"Now if Ah Kurroo Khan were asked to fall upon them immediately, he could destroy them in the mass, and overthrow them without difficulty. Might he send such a message to the Khan? The assembly applauded the fox's foresight, and away flew the starling with the message. Ah Kurroo, only too delighted to have the opportunity of overthrowing his old enemy Kauc, and his hated rival Ki Ki, immediately gave the order to advance to his legions.",ask fall destroy mass overthrow difficulty send message assembly applaud fox foresight fly starling message delighted have opportunity overthrow old enemy hate rival give order advance legion 
61,"Meantime the deputation, consisting of the hare, the squirrel, and Cloctaw, waited upon Sir Bevis, who received them very courteously upon his seat of moss under the oak. He replied that he would shoot off his cannon-stick with the greatest pleasure, if they would show him in which direction they expected Choo Hoo to come. So the hare, the squirrel, and Cloctaw, with all the crowd following behind, took him to a gap in the hedge round the copse on the western side, and pointed out to him the way the enemy would come.",deputation consist hare squirrel wait receive seat moss oak reply shoot stick great pleasure show direction expect come hare squirrel crowd follow take gap hedge copse western side point way enemy come 
62,"Indeed, Sir Bevis had hardly taken his stand and seen to the priming than the van-guard of the barbarians appeared over the tops of the trees. They were pushing on with all speed, for it seems that the outposts had reported to the emperor that there was a division in the copse, and that civil war had broken out, being deceived by the attack delivered by Ah Kurroo upon the black pretender Kauc. Up then came the mighty host in such vast and threatening numbers that the sun was darkened as it had been on the day of the eclipse, and the crowd behind Sir Bevis, overwhelmed with fear, could scarce stand their ground. But Sir Bevis, not one whit daunted, dropped upon one knee, and levelling his cannon-stick upon the other, applied his match. The fire and smoke and sound of the report shook the confidence of the front ranks of the enemy; they paused and wheeled to the right and left instead of advancing.",take stand see priming van guard barbarian appear top tree push speed seem outpost report emperor be division copse civil war break deceive attack deliver black pretender come mighty host such vast threatening number sun darken day eclipse crowd overwhelm fear scarce stand ground whit daunt drop knee levell can non stick other apply match fire smoke sound report shake confidence front rank enemy pause wheel right leave advance 
63,"In a minute Bevis had his cannon-stick charged again, and bang it went. The second rank now turned and fell back and threw the host into confusion; still the vast numbers behind pushed blindly on. Bevis, in a state of excitement, now prepared for a grand effort. He filled his cannon with powder nearly to the muzzle, he rammed it down tight, and fearing lest it might kick and hurt him, he fixed his weapon on the stump of an elm which had been thrown some winters since, and whose fall had made the gap in the hedge. Then he cut a long, slender willow stick, slit it at one end, and inserted his match in the cleft. He could thus stand a long way back out of harm's way and ignite the priming. The report that followed was so loud the very woods rang again, the birds fluttered with fear, and even the fox, bold as he was, shrank back from such a tremendous explosion.",minute have can non stick charge bang go second rank turn fall throw host confusion vast number push state excitement prepare grand effort fill can non powder muzzle ramm tight fear kick hurt fix weapon stump elm throw winter fall make gap hedge cut long slender willow stick slit end insert match cleft stand long way harm way ignite priming report follow loud very wood ring bird flutter fear fox bold shrank tremendous explosion 
64,"Quite beside themselves with panic fear, the barbarian host turned and fled in utter confusion, nor could Choo Hoo, with all his efforts, rally them again, for having once suffered defeat in the battle of the eclipse, they had lost confidence. Ah Kurroo Khan, just as he had driven in the defenders and taken Kauc's camp (though Kauc himself, like the coward he was, escaped before the conflict began), saw the confusion and retreat of Choo Hoo's host, and without a moment's delay hurled his legions once more on the retiring barbarians. The greater number fled in every direction, each only trying to save himself; but the best of Choo Hoo's troops took refuge in their old camp.",panic fear barbarian host turn flead utter confusion effort rally suffer defeat battle eclipse lose confidence drive defender take camp coward escape conflict begin see confusion retreat host moment delay hurl legion more retire barbarian great number flead direction try save good troops take refuge old camp 
65,"Ah Kurroo Khan surrounded and invested the camp, but he hesitated to storm it, for he knew that it would entail heavy losses. He prepared to blockade Choo Hoo with such strictness that he must eventually surrender from sheer hunger. He despatched a starling with a message, describing the course he had taken at once to the copse, and the starling, flying with great speed, arrived there in a few minutes. Meanwhile the assembly, delighted with the success which had attended Bevis's cannonading, crowded round and overwhelmed him with their thanks. Then when their excitement had somewhat abated, they remembered that the idea had emanated from the fox, and it was resolved to proceed with his coronation at once. Just then the starling arrived from the Khan.",surround invest camp hesitate storm know entail heavy loss prepare blockade such strictness surrender sheer hunger despatch starling message describe course take copse starling fly great speed arrive few minute assembly delight success attend cannonade crowd round overwhelm thanks excitement abate remember idea emanate fox resolve proceed coronation starling arrive 
66,"""Ah! yes,"" said Eric, the missel-thrush, who wanted Tchack-tchack to ascend the throne of his fathers, ""it is true Choo Hoo is driven back and his camp surrounded. But do you bear in mind that Tu Kiu is not in it. He, they say, has gone into the west and has already collected a larger host than even Choo Hoo commanded, who are coming up as fast as they can to avenge the Battle of the Eclipse. You must also remember that Sir Bevis cannot be always here with his cannon-stick; he is not often here in the morning, and who can tell that some day while he is away Tu Kiu may not appear and, while Choo Hoo makes a sortie and engages Ah Kurroo's attention, come on here and ravage the whole place, destroy all our stores, and leave us without a berry or an acorn! It seems to me that the fox has only got us into a deeper trouble than ever, for if Choo Hoo or Tu Kiu ever does come down upon us, they will exact a still worse vengeance for the disgrace they have suffered. The fox has only half succeeded; he must devise something more before he can claim our perfect confidence.""",say missel thrush want tchack ascend throne father true drive camp surround bear mind say go west collect large host command come avenge remember stick morning tell day appear make sortie engage attention come ravage whole place destroy store leave berry acorn seem fox get deep trouble come exact bad vengeance disgrace suffer fox half succeed devise claim perfect confidence

68,"Now the fox hated the missel-thrush beyond all expression, for just as he was, as it seemed, about to grasp the object of his ambition, the missel-thrush always suggested some new difficulty and delayed his triumph, but he suppressed his temper and said: ""The missel-thrush is a true patriot, and speaks with a view not to his own interest but to the good of his country. I myself fully admit the truth of his observations; Choo Hoo is indeed checked for a time, but there is no knowing how soon we may hear the shout of 'Koos-takke' again.

69,"""There can be no doubt but that this invasion has gone on year after year, because the kingdom of Kapchack had become somewhat unwieldy with numerous annexations, and could not be adequately defended. This policy of annexation which the late government carried on for so long, bore, indeed, upon the surface the false glitter of glory. We heard of provinces and principalities added to the realm, and we forgot the cost.

It will enable us one and all to enjoy the fruits of the earth. I humbly propose that a treaty be made with Choo Hoo ('Oh! Oh!' from the missel-thrush and Tchack-tchack), that upon the payment of an ample war indemnity--say a million nuts, two million acorns, and five million berries, or some trifling figure like that, not to be too exorbitant--he be permitted to withdraw ('Shame!' from Tchack-tchack), and that the provinces torn by force and fraud by the late government from their lawful owners be restored to them ('Which means,' said the missel-thrush, 'that as the lawful owners are not strong enough to protect themselves, Choo Hoo may plunder half the world as he likes'), and that peace be proclaimed.

75,"So soon as they had gone the assembly proceeded to appoint a Commission to negotiate the treaty of peace. It consisted of the woodpecker, the thrush, and Cloctaw: the stoat muttered a good deal, for having been almost the only adherent of the fox in his former lowly condition, he expected profitable employment now his friend had obtained such dignity. The fox, however, called him aside and whispered something which satisfied him, and the Commission having received instructions proceeded at once to Ah Kurroo, who was to furnish them with a flag of truce. A company of starlings went with them to act as couriers and carry intelligence. When the Commission reached Ah Kurroo, he declined to open a truce with Choo Hoo, even for a moment, and presently, as the Commission solemnly demanded obedience in the name of the fox, he decided to go himself to the king-elect and explain the reasons--of a purely military character--which led him to place this obstruction in their way.",go assembly proceed appoint commission negotiate treaty peace consist woodpecker thrush stoat mutter good deal only adherent fox former lowly condition expect profitable employment friend obtain such dignity fox call whisper satisfy commission receive instruction proceed furnish flag truce company starling go act courier carry intelligence commission reach decline open truce moment commission demand obedience name fox decide go king elect explain reason military character lead place obstruction way 
76,"The fox received Ah Kurroo with demonstrations of the deepest respect, congratulated him upon his achievements, and admired the disposition he had made of his forces so as to completely blockade the enemy. Ah Kurroo, much pleased with this reception, and the appreciation of his services, pointed out that Choo Hoo was now so entirely in his power, that in a few days he would have to surrender, as provisions were failing him. Long ere Tu Kiu could return with the relieving column the emperor would be a captive. Ah Kurroo begged the fox not to throw away this glorious opportunity.",fox receive demonstration deep respect congratulate achievement admire disposition make force blockade enemy pleased reception appreciation service point power few day have surrender provision fail long return relieve column emperor captive begg fox throw glorious opportunity 
77,"The king-elect, who had his own reasons for not desiring the Khan to appear too victorious, listened attentively, but pointed out that it was not so much himself, but the nation which demanded instant peace.",king elect have own reason desire appear victorious listen point nation demand instant peace 
78,"""Moreover,"" said he in a whisper to the Khan, ""don't you see, my dear general, that if you totally destroy Choo Hoo your occupation will be gone; we shall not require an army or a general.

79,"""Say no more,"" said Ah Kurroo, ""say no more;"" then aloud: ""Your royal highness' commands shall be immediately obeyed;"" and away he flew, and gave the Commission the flag of truce.",say more say say more royal highness command obey fly give commission flag truce 
80,"Choo Hoo, confined in his camp with a murmuring and mutinous soldiery, short of provisions, and expecting every moment to see the enemy pouring into his midst, was beyond measure delighted when he heard that peace was proposed, indeed he could scarcely believe that any one in his senses could offer such a thing to an army which must inevitably surrender in a few hours. But when he heard that the fox was the king-elect, he began to comprehend, for there were not wanting suspicions that it was the fox who, when Choo Hoo was only a nameless adventurer, assisted him with advice.",confine camp murmure mutinous soldiery short provision expect moment see enemy pour midst measure delight hear peace propose believe one sense offer thing army surrender few hour hear fox king elect begin comprehend want suspicion fox nameless adventurer assist advice 
81,"The Commission, therefore, found their task easy enough so far as the main point was concerned, that there should be peace, but when they came to discuss the conditions it became a different matter. The fox, a born diplomat, had instructed them to put forward the hardest conditions first, and if they could not force these upon Choo Hoo to gradually slacken them, little by little, till they overcame his reluctance. At every step they sent couriers to the king-elect with precise information of their progress.",find task easy main point concerned be peace come discuss condition become different matter fox bear diplomat instruct put hard condition force slack little little overcame reluctance step send courier king elect precise information progress 
82,"The negotiations lasted a very long time, quite an hour, during which the couriers flew incessantly to and fro, and Bevis, lying on his back on the moss under the oak, tried which could screech the loudest, himself or the jay. Bevis would easily have won had he been able to resist the inclination to pull the jay's tail, which made the latter set up such a yell that everybody started, Bevis shouted with laughter, and even the fox lost his gravity.",negotiation last long time hour courier fly for lie back moss oak try screech loudest jay win able resist inclination pull jay tail make latter set yell start shout laughter fox lose gravity 
83,"Choo Hoo agreed to everything without much difficulty, except the indemnity; he drew back at that, declaring it was too many millions, and there was even some danger of the negotiations being broken off. But the fox was equally firm, he insisted on it, and even added 10,000 bushels of grain to the original demand, at which Choo Hoo nearly choked with indignation. The object of the fox in requiring the grain was to secure the faithful allegiance of all his lesser subjects, as the sparrows, and indeed he regarded the indemnity as the most certain means of beginning his reign at the height of popularity, since it would be distributed among the nation. People could not, moreover, fail to remark the extreme disinterestedness of the king, since of all these millions of berries, acorns, nuts, grain, and so forth, there was not one single mouthful for himself. Choo Hoo, as said before, full of indignation, abruptly turned away from the Commission, and, at a loss what to do, they communicated with the fox.",agree much difficulty indemnity draw declare many million be danger negotiation break fox firm insist add bushel grain original demand choke indignation object fox require grain secure faithful allegiance less subject sparrow regard indemnity certain means begin reign height popularity distribute nation person fail remark extreme disinterestedness king million berries acorn nut grain be single mouthful say full indignation turn commission loss do communicate fox 
84,"He ordered them to inform Choo Hoo that under certain restrictions travellers would in future be permitted access to the spring in the copse which did not freeze in winter. The besieged emperor somewhat relaxed the austerity of his demeanour at this; another pourparler took place, in the midst of which the fox told the Commission to mention (as if casually) that among others there would be a clause restoring independence to all those princes and archdukes whose domains the late Kapchack had annexed. Choo Hoo could scarce maintain decorum when he heard this; he could have shouted with delight, for he saw in a moment that it was equivalent to ceding half Kapchack's kingdom, since these small Powers would never be able to defend themselves against his hosts.",order inform certain restriction traveller future permit access spring copse freeze winter besiege emperor relax austerity demeanour pourparler take place midst fox tell commission mention other be clause restore independence prince archduke domain late annex scarce maintain decorum hear shout delight see moment equivalent cede half kingdom small able defend host 
85,"At the same moment, too, he was called aside, and informed that a private messenger had arrived from the fox: it was the humble-bee, who had slipped easily through the lines and conveyed a strong hint from the king-elect. The fox said he had done the best he could for his brother, the emperor, remembering their former acquaintance; now let the emperor do his part, and between them they could rule the earth with ease. Choo Hoo, having told the humble-bee that he quite understood, and that he agreed to the fox's offer, dismissed him, and returned to the Commission, whose labours were now coming to a close.",same moment call inform private messenger arrive fox humble bee slip line convey strong hint king elect fox say do good brother emperor remember former acquaintance let emperor do part rule earth ease tell humble bee understand agree fox offer dismiss return commission labour come close 
86,"All the clauses having been agreed to, Ess, the owl, as the most practised in such matters, was appointed by the fox to draw up the document in proper form for signature. While this was being done, the king-elect proceeded to appoint his Cabinet: Sec, the stoat, was nominated treasurer; Ah Kurroo Khan, commander-in-chief for life; Ess, the owl, continued chief secretary of state; Cloctaw was to be grand chamberlain; Raoul, the rat, lieutenant-governor of the coast (along the brook and Long Pond), and so on.",clause agree owl practise such matter appoint fox draw document proper form signature do king elect proceed appoint cabinet stoat nominate treasurer commander chief life owl continue chief secretary state grand chamberlain rat lieutenant governor coast brook long 
87,"Next the weasel, having failed to present himself when summoned by the woodpecker, was attainted as contumacious, and sentenced, with the entire approval of the assembly, to lose all his dignities and estates; his woods, parks, forests, and all his property were escheated to the Crown, and were by the king handed over to his faithful follower Sec. The weasel (whose whereabouts could not be discovered) was also proclaimed an outlaw, whom any one might slay without fear of trial. It was then announced that all others who absented themselves from the court, and were not present when the treaty was signed, would be treated as traitors, and receive the same punishment as the weasel.",weasel fail present summon woodpecker attaint contumacious sentence entire approval assembly lose dignity estate wood park forest property escheat king hand faithful follower weasel whereabouts discover proclaim outlaw one slay fear trial announce other absent court present treaty sign treat traitor receive same punishment weasel 
88,"Immediately he heard this, Yiwy, son and heir of Ki Ki, the hawk, who had fled, came and paid homage to the fox, first to save the estates from confiscation, and secondly that he might enjoy them in his father's place. Ki Ki was accordingly declared an outlaw. Directly afterwards, Kauc, the crow, crept in, much crestfallen, and craved pardon, hoping to save his property. The assembly received him with hisses and hoots: still the fox kept his word, and permitted him to retain his estates upon payment of an indemnity for the cost of the troops employed against him under Ah Kurroo, of 100,000 acorns. Kauc protested that he should be ruined: but the crowd would not hear him, and he was obliged to submit.",hear son heir hawk flead come pay homage fox first save estate confiscation enjoy father place declare outlaw crow creep crestfallen crave pardon hope save property assembly receive hiss hoot fox keep word permit retain estate payment indemnity cost troops employ acorn protest ruin crowd hear oblige submit 
89,"Then Eric, the missel-thrush, and Prince Tchack-tchack flew up: the prince had yielded to good advice, and resolved to smother his resentment in order to enjoy the immense private domains of his late parent. The protocols were now ready, and the fox had already taken the document to sign, when there was a rush of wings, and in came six or seven of those princes and archdukes--among them the archduke of the peewits--to whom independence was to be restored. They loudly proclaimed their loyalty, and begged not to be cast off: declaring that they were quite unable to defend themselves, and should be mercilessly plundered by the barbarian horde. The fox lifted his paw in amazement that there should exist on the face of the earth any such poltroons as this, who preferred to pay tribute and enjoy peace rather than endure the labour of defending their own independence. The whole assembly cried shame upon them, but the princes persisted, and filled the court with their lamentations, till at a sign from the king they were hustled out of the copse.",missel thrush fly prince yield good advice resolve smother resentment order enjoy immense private domain late parent protocol ready fox take document sign be rush wing come prince archduke archduke peewit independence restore proclaim loyalty begg cast declare unable defend plunder barbarian horde fox lift paw amazement exist face earth such poltroon prefer pay tribute enjoy peace endure labour defend own independence whole assembly cry shame prince persist fill court lamentation sign king hustle copse 
90,"The treaty itself filled so many pages of parchment that no one attempted to read it, the owl certifying that it was all correct: an extract, however, divested of technical expressions, was handed about the court, and was to the following effect:--",treaty fill many page parchment attempt read owl certify correct extract divest technical expression hand court follow effect

The copse itself is hereby declared a neutral zone, wherein all councils, pourparlers, parliaments, commissions, markets, fairs, meetings, courts of justice, and one and all and every such assembly for public or private purposes, may be and shall be held, without let or hindrance, saving only:--(_a_) Plots against His Majesty King Reynard CI.; (_b_) plots against His Imperial Majesty Choo Hoo.",copse declare neutral zone council pourparler parliament commission market fair meeting court justice such assembly public private purpose hold let hindrance save plot _b_ plot imperial

100," Every one in fact signed it but the weasel, who was still lying sullenly _perdu_. The B. was for Bevis; the fox, who excelled in the art of paying delicate compliments, insisted upon Bevis signing next to the high contracting parties. So taking the quill, Bevis printed a good big B, a little staggering, but plain and legible. Directly this business was concluded, Ah Kurroo withdrew his legions; Choo Hoo sallied forth from the camp, and returning the way he had come, in about an hour was met by his son Tu Kiu at the head of enormous reinforcements. Delighted at the treaty, and the impunity they now enjoyed, the vast barbarian horde, divided into foraging parties of from one hundred to a thousand, spread over a tract of country thirty miles wide, rolled like a devastating tidal wave in resistless course southwards, driving the independent princes before them, plundering, ravaging, and destroying, and leaving famine behind. Part of the plunder indeed, of the provinces recently attached to Kapchack's kingdom, and now declared independent, furnished the first instalment of the war indemnity the barbarians had engaged to pay.",one fact sign weasel lie fox excell art pay delicate compliment insist signing high contracting party take quill print good big b little staggering plain legible business conclude withdraw legion sall camp return way come hour meet son head enormous reinforcement delight treaty impunity enjoy vast barbarian horde divide foraging party spread tract country mile wide roll devastating tidal wave resistless course drive independent prince plunder ravage destroy leave famine part plunder province attach kingdom declare independent furnish first instalment war indemnity barbarian engage pay 
101,"Meantime, in the copse, preparations were made for the coronation of the king, who had assumed, in accordance with well-known precedents, that all his ancestors, whether acknowledged or not, had reigned, and called himself King Reynard the Hundred and First. The procession having been formed, and all the ceremonies completed, Bevis banged off his cannon-stick as a salute, and the fox, taking the crown, proceeded to put it on his head, remarking as he did so that thus they might see how when rogues fall out honest folk come by their own.",copse preparation make coronation king assume accordance know precedent ancestor acknowledge reign call first procession form ceremony complete bang can non stick salute fox take crown proceed put head remark see rogue fall honest folk come own
