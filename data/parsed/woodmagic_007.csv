2," The next morning passed quickly, Bevis having so much to do. Hur-hur, the pig, asked him to dig up some earth-nuts for him with his knife, for the ground was hard from the heat of the sun, and he could not thrust his snout in. Then Pan, the spaniel, had to be whipped very severely because he would not climb a tree; and so the morning was taken up. After the noontide heat had decreased, Bevis again started, and found his way by the aid of the oak to the corner of the wheat-field. The dragon-fly was waiting for him with a message from the hare, saying that she had been invited to a party on the hills, so the dragon-fly would guide him into the copse.",next morning pass have much do pig ask dig earth nut knife ground hard heat sun thrust snout spaniel have whip climb tree morning take noontide heat decrease start find way aid oak corner wheat field dragon fly wait message hare say invite party hill dragon fly guide copse 
3,"Flying before him, the dragon-fly led the way, often going a long distance ahead, and coming back in a minute, for he moved so rapidly it was not possible for Bevis to keep pace with him, and he was too restless to stand still. Bevis walked carefully over the bridge, holding to the rail, as the toad had told him; and passing the thistles, and the grass, and the ferns, came to the piece of timber. There he sat down to rest, while the dragon-fly played to and fro, now rising to the top of the trees, and now darting down again, to show off his dexterity. While he was sitting there a crow came along and looked at him hard, but said nothing; and immediately afterwards a jackdaw went over, remarking what a lovely day it was.",fly dragon fly lead way go long distance come minute move possible keep pace restless stand walk bridge hold rail toad tell pass thistle grass fern come piece timber sit rest dragon fly play for rise top tree dart show dexterity sit crow come look say jackdaw go remark lovely day 
4,"""Now take me to the raspberries,"" said Bevis; and the dragon-fly, winding in and out the trees, brought him to the thicket, showed him the place to creep in, and left, promising to return by-and-by and fetch him when it was time to go home. Bevis, warm with walking in the sunshine, after he had crept in to the raspberries, went across and sat down on the moss under the oak; and he had hardly leant his back against the tree than the squirrel came along the ground and sat beside him.",take raspberry say dragon fly wind tree bring thicket show place creep leave promise return fetch time go warm walk sunshine creep raspberry go sit moss oak lean back tree squirrel come ground sit 
5,"""You are just in time, my dear,"" he said, speaking low and rapidly, and glancing round to see that no one was near; ""for there is going to be a secret council of the courtiers this afternoon, while Kapchack takes his nap; and in order that none of the little birds may play the spy and carry information to the police, Kauc, the crow, has been flying round and driving them away, so that there is not so much as a robin left in the copse. This is an employment that suits him very well, for he loves to play the tyrant. Perhaps you saw him coming in. And this council is about Kapchack's love affair, and to decide what is to be done, and whether it can be put up with, or whether they must refuse to receive her.""",time dear say speak low glance see be go be secret council courtier afternoon take nap order little bird play spy carry information police crow fly drive be much robin leave copse employment suit love play tyrant see come council love affair decide do put refuse receive 
6,"""And who is she?"" said Bevis; ""you keep on talking, but you do not tell me."" The squirrel pricked up his ears and looked cross, but he heard the people coming to the council, and knew there was no time to be lost in quarrelling, so he did not go off in a pet this time. ""The lady is the youngest jay, dear, in the wood; La Schach is her name; she is sweetly pretty, and dresses charmingly in blue and brown. She is sweetly pretty, though they say rather a flirt, and flighty in her ways. She has captivated a great many with her bright colour, and now this toothless old Kapchack--but hush! It is a terrible scandal.

7,"Bevis went after him under the brambles and the ferns till he found a place in a hollow ash-stole, where it was hung all round with honeysuckle, and then, doing as the squirrel told him, he sat down, and was quite concealed from sight; while the squirrel stopped on a bough just over his head, where he could whisper and explain things. Though Bevis was himself hidden, he could see very well; and he had not been there a minute before he heard a rustling, and saw the fox come stealthily out from the fern, and sit under an ancient hollow pollard close by.",go bramble fern find place hollow ash steal hang honeysuckle do squirrel tell sit conceal sight squirrel stop bough head whisper explain thing hide see minute hear rustling see fox come fern sit ancient hollow pollard 
8,"The stoat came close behind him; he was something like the weasel, and they say a near relation; he is much bolder than the weasel, but not one quarter so cunning. He is very jealous, too, of the power the weasel has got on account of his cunning, and if he could he would strangle his kinsman. The rat could not attend, having very important business at the brook that day, but he had sent the mouse to listen and tell him all that was said. The fox looked at the mouse askance from the corner of his eye; and the stoat could not refrain from licking his lips, though it was well understood that at these assemblies all private feelings were to be rigidly suppressed. So that the mouse was quite safe; still, seeing the fox's glance, and the stoat's teeth glistening, he kept very near a little hole under a stole, where he could rush in if alarmed.",stoat come weasel say near relation bold weasel quarter cunning jealous power weasel get account cunning strangle kinsman rat attend have important business brook day send mouse listen tell say fox look mouse askance corner eye stoat refrain lick lip understand assembly private feeling suppress mouse safe see fox glance stoat tooth glisten keep little hole steal rush alarm

11,"""Ah,"" said the fox, ""perhaps he had an eye himself to this beautiful young creature. Depend upon it there's more under the surface than we have heard of yet."" Just then a message came from the weasel regretting very much that he could not be present, owing to indisposition, but saying that he quite agreed with all that was going to be said, and that he would act as the others decided, and follow them in all things. This message was delivered by a humble-bee, who having repeated all the weasel had told him to, went buzzing on among the thistles.",say fox have eye beautiful young creature depend be more surface hear message come weasel regret much present ow indisposition say agree go say act other decide follow thing message deliver humble bee repeat weasel tell go buzz thistle 
12,"""I do not quite like this,"" said a deep hollow voice; and looking up, Bevis saw the face of the owl at the mouth of a hole in the pollard-tree. He was winking in the light, and could not persuade himself to come out, which was the reason the council was held at the foot of his house, as it was necessary he should take part in it. ""I do not quite like this,"" said the owl, very solemnly, ""Is the weasel sincere in all he says? Is he really unwell, or does he keep away in order that if Kapchack hears of this meeting he may say: 'I was not there. I did not take any part in it'?""",like say deep hollow voice look see face owl mouth hole pollard tree wink light persuade come reason council hold foot house necessary take part like say owl weasel sincere say unwell keep order hear meeting say take part

15,"""I really do not know where he lives,"" said the squirrel. ""I have not seen him lately, and I am afraid he is keeping his bed.""

17,"""I cannot agree to that,"" said the owl; ""the mouse is very clever, and his opinion worthy of attention; we cannot spare him."" The truth was, the owl, squinting down, had seen what a plump mouse it was, and he reflected that if the weasel saw him he would never rest till he had tasted him, whereas he thought he should like to meet the mouse by moonlight shortly. ""Upon the whole, I really don't know that we need send for the weasel,"" he went on, thinking that if the weasel came he would fasten his affections upon the mouse.",agree say owl mouse clever opinion worthy attention spare truth owl squint see plump mouse reflect weasel see rest taste think like meet mouse moonlight whole know need send weasel go think weasel come fast affection mouse

26,"""The council is not complete without the weasel,"" screamed a jay, coming up; he was in a terrible temper, for the lady jay whom Kapchack was in love with had promised him her hand, till the opportunity of so much grandeur turned her head, and she jilted him like a true daughter of the family, as she was. For the jays are famous for jilting their lovers. ""If the mouse is afraid,"" said the jay, ""I'll fetch the humble-bee back, and if he won't come I'll speak a word to my friend the shrike, and have him spitted on a thorn in a minute.""

27,"""It falls upon you, as the oldest of the party, to give him his commands,"" said Tchink, the chaffinch, addressing the owl. The owl looked at the crow, and the crow scowled at the chaffinch, who turned his back on him, being very saucy. He had watched his opportunity while the crow went round the copse to drive away the small birds, and slipped in to appear at the council. He was determined to assert his presence, and take as much part as the others in these important events. If the goldfinches, and the thrushes, and blackbirds, and robins, and greenfinches, and sparrows, and so on, were so meek as to submit to be excluded, and were content to have no voice in the matter till they were called upon to obey orders, that was their affair. They were a bevy of poor-spirited, mean things. He was not going to be put down like that. Tchink was, indeed, a very impudent fellow: Bevis liked him directly, and determined to have a chat with him by-and-by.",fall old party give command say chaffinch address owl owl look crow crow scowl chaffinch turn back saucy watch opportunity crow go copse drive small bird slip appear council determined assert presence take much part other important event goldfinche thrushe blackbird robin greenfinche sparrow meek submit exclude content have voice matter call obey order affair bevy poor spirit mean thing go put impudent fellow like determined have chat

29,"""All right, old Spectacles,"" said Tchink; ""you're not a bad sort of fellow by daylight, though I have heard tales of your not behaving quite so properly at night.""

30,"The owl, seeing the fox tittering, and the crow secretly pleased at this remark, thought it best to take no notice, but ordered the humble-bee, in the name of the council, to at once proceed to the weasel, and inform him that the council was unable to accept his excuses, but was waiting his arrival.",owl see fox tittering crow pleased remark think good take notice order humble bee name council proceed weasel inform council unable accept excuse wait arrival

34,"""In my opinion,"" said Cloctaw, speaking rather huskily, for he was very old, ""Tchack-tchack will not come. I know him well--I can see through him--he is a double-faced rascal like--like (he was going to say the fox, but recollected himself in time) his--well, never matter; like all his race then.

I propose that we at once begin the discussion, and then if the weasel and Tchack-tchack come they can join in. I regret to say that my kinsman, the missel-thrush who frequents the orchard (by special permission of Kapchack, as you know), is not here. The pampered fawning wretch!--I hate such favourites--they disgrace a court. Why, all the rest of our family are driven forth like rogues, and are not permitted to come near!

There is no record, gentlemen, of any such event having taken place. I may say, without fear of contradiction, that no precedent exists. We may, therefore, regard it as a fixed principle of common law, from which no departure can be legal, without the special and express sanction of all the nation, or of its representatives assembled. We may even go further, and hazard the opinion, not without some authority, that even with such sanction, such departure from constitutional usage could not be sustained were an appeal to be lodged.",custom continue owl exist look archive house turn dusty record inconvenience discover single instance departure history begin be record gentleman such event take place say fear contradiction precedent exist regard fix principle common law departure legal special express sanction nation representative assemble go hazard opinion authority such sanction such departure constitutional usage sustain appeal lodg

Customs of this kind, which are founded upon the innate sense and feeling of every individual, cannot, in short, be abolished by Act of Parliament. Upon this all the authorities I have consulted are perfectly agreed. What has grown up during the process of so many generations, cannot be now put on one side. This, gentlemen, is rather an abstruse part of the question, being one which recommends itself for consideration to the purely legal intellect. It is a matter, too, of high state policy which rises above the knowledge of the common herd. We may take it for granted, and pass on from the general to the special aspect of this most remarkable case.",high court representative nation assemble fulness power legalise own nature illegal custom kind found innate sense feeling individual short abolish authority consult agree grow process many generation put side gentleman abstruse part question recommend consideration legal intellect matter high state policy rise knowledge common herd take grant pass general special aspect remarkable case

We may therefore conclude, without fear of contradiction, that this alliance will be followed by others equally opposed to tradition. We shall have hundreds of other equally ill-assorted unions. If it could be confined to this one instance, a dispensation might doubtless be arranged. I, for one, should not oppose it. ('I hate you!' shouted the jay.)

This niche he discovered in his hot youth, when he won renown by his strength and courage: he chose it for his home, and defended it against all comers.
