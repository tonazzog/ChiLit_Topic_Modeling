1,CHAPTER I. _How the Fairies were not Invited to Court_,invite 
2,"ONCE upon a time there reigned in Pantouflia a king and a queen. With almost everything else to make them happy, they wanted one thing: they had no children. This vexed the king even more than the queen, who was very clever and learned, and who had hated dolls when she was a child. However, she too, in spite of all the books she read and all the pictures she painted, would have been glad enough to be the mother of a little prince. The king was anxious to consult the fairies, but the queen would not hear of such a thing. She did not believe in fairies: she said that they had never existed; and that she maintained, though _The History of the Royal Family_ was full of chapters about nothing else.",time reign king queen else make happy want thing have child vex king more queen clever learn hate doll child spite book read picture paint glad mother little prince king anxious consult fairy queen hear thing believe fairy say exist maintain royal full chapter else 
3,"Well, at long and at last they had a little boy, who was generally regarded as the finest baby that had ever been seen. Even her majesty herself remarked that, though she could never believe all the courtiers told her, yet he certainly was a fine child--a very fine child.",last have little boy regard fine baby see majesty remark believe courtier tell fine child fine child 
4,"Now, the time drew near for the christening party, and the king and queen were sitting at breakfast in their summer parlour talking over it. It was a splendid room, hung with portraits of the royal ancestors. There was Cinderella, the grandmother of the reigning monarch, with her little foot in her glass slipper thrust out before her. There was the Marquis de Carabas, who, as everyone knows, was raised to the throne as prince consort after his marriage with the daughter of the king of the period. On the arm of the throne was seated his celebrated cat, wearing boots. There, too, was a portrait of a beautiful lady, sound asleep: this was Madame La Belle au Bois-dormant, also an ancestress of the royal family. Many other pictures of celebrated persons were hanging on the walls.",time draw christening party king queen sit breakfast summer parlour talk splendid room hang portrait royal ancestor be grandmother reign monarch little foot glass slipper thrust be know raise throne prince consort marriage daughter king period arm throne seat celebrate cat wear boot portrait beautiful lady sound asleep dormant ancestress royal family many other picture celebrate person hang wall

7,"“People are so touchy on these occasions,” said his majesty. “You have not forgotten any of our aunts?”",person touchy occasion say majesty forget aunt 
8,"“No; the old cats!” replied the queen; for the king’s aunts were old-fashioned, and did not approve of her, and she knew it. “They are very kind old ladies in their way,” said the king; “and were nice to me when I was a boy.”",old cat reply queen king aunt old fashioned approve know kind old lady way say king nice boy 
9,"Then he waited a little, and remarked:",wait little remark 
10,"“The fairies, of course, you have invited? It has always been usual, in our family, on an occasion like this; and I think we have neglected them a little of late.”",fairy course invite usual family occasion think neglect little late 
11,"“How _can_ you be so _absurd?_” cried the queen. “How often must I tell you that there are _no_ fairies? And even if there were--but, no matter; pray let us drop the subject.”",_absurd cry queen tell be _no_ fairy be matter pray let drop subject 
12,"“They are very old friends of our family, my dear, that’s all,” said the king timidly. “Often and often they have been godmothers to us. One, in particular, was most kind and most serviceable to Cinderella I., my own grandmother.”",old friend family dear say king godmother particular kind serviceable own grandmother 
13,“Your grandmother!” interrupted her majesty. “Fiddle-de-dee! If anyone puts such nonsense into the head of my little Prigio----”,grandmother interrupt majesty put such nonsense head little 
14,"But here the baby was brought in by the nurse, and the queen almost devoured it with kisses. And so the fairies were not invited! It was an extraordinary thing, but none of the nobles could come to the christening party when they learned that the fairies had not been asked. Some were abroad; several were ill; a few were in prison among the Saracens; others were captives in the dens of ogres. The end of it was that the king and queen had to sit down alone, one at each end of a very long table, arrayed with plates and glasses for a hundred guests--for a hundred guests who never came!",baby bring nurse queen devoure kisse fairy invite extraordinary thing noble come christening party learn fairy ask several ill few prison other captive den ogre end king queen have sit end long table array plate glasses guest guest come 
15,"“Any soup, my dear?” shouted the king, through a speaking-trumpet; when, suddenly, the air was filled with a sound like the rustling of the wings of birds.",soup dear shout king speak trumpet air fill sound rustling wing bird 
16,"_Flitter, flitter, flutter_, went the noise; and when the queen looked up, lo and behold! on every seat was a lovely fairy, dressed in green, each with a _most interesting-looking parcel_ in her hand. Don’t you like opening parcels? The king did, and he was most friendly and polite to the fairies. But the queen, though she saw them distinctly, took no notice of them. You see, she did not believe in fairies, nor in her own eyes, when she saw them. So she talked across the fairies to the king, just as if they had not been there; but the king behaved as politely as if they were _real_--which, of course, they were.",flitter flitter flutter_ go noise queen look behold seat lovely fairy dress green _most interesting look parcel_ hand like open parcel king friendly polite fairy queen see take notice see believe fairy own eye see talk fairy king king behave course 
17,"When dinner was over, and when the nurse had brought in the baby, all the fairies gave him the most magnificent presents. One offered a purse which could never be empty; and one a pair of seven-leagued boots; and another a cap of darkness, that nobody might see the prince when he put it on; and another a wishing-cap; and another a carpet, on which, when he sat, he was carried wherever he wished to find himself. Another made him beautiful for ever; and another, brave; and another, lucky: but the last fairy of all, a cross old thing, crept up and said, “My child, you shall be _too_ clever!”",dinner nurse bring baby fairy give magnificent present offer purse empty pair leagued boot cap darkness see prince put wish cap carpet sit carry wish find make beautiful brave lucky last fairy cross old thing creep say child clever 
18,"This fairy’s gift would have pleased the queen, if she had believed in it, more than anything else, because she was so clever herself. But she took no notice at all; and the fairies went each to her own country, and none of them stayed there at the palace, where nobody believed in them, except the king, a little. But the queen tossed all their nice boots and caps, carpets, purses, swords, and all, away into a dark lumber-room; for, of course, she thought that they were _all nonsense_, and merely old rubbish out of books, or pantomime “properties.”",fairy gift pleased queen believe more else clever take notice fairy go own country stay palace believe king little queen toss nice boot cap carpet purse sword dark lumber room course think _all nonsense_ old rubbish book pantomime property
