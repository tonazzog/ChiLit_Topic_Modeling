29,"The girls went on, and Margaret began to like the idea very much, and consider whether the girl could be brought for inspection, before nurse was prejudiced by hearing of her Cocksmoor extraction. At that moment Richard knocked at the door, and entered with Tom, helping him to bring a small short-legged table, such as could stand on the bed at the right height for Margaret’s meals or employments.",girl go begin like idea consider girl bring inspection nurse prejudice hearing extraction moment knock door enter help bring small short legged table such stand bed right height meal employment

42,So it was determined that Richard and Ethel should walk together to Cocksmoor.,determine walk 
43,"No two people could be much more unlike than Richard and Etheldred May; but they were very fond of each other. Richard was sometimes seriously annoyed by Ethel’s heedlessness, and did not always understand her sublimities, but he had a great deal of admiration for one who partook so much of his father’s nature; and Ethel had a due respect for her eldest brother, gratitude and strong affection for many kindnesses, a reverence for his sterling goodness, and his exemption from her own besetting failings, only a little damped by compassionate wonder at his deficiency in talent, and by her vexation at not being always comprehended.",person fond other annoy heedlessness understand sublimity have great deal admiration partaok much father nature have due respect old brother gratitude strong affection many kindness reverence sterling goodness exemption own besetting failing little damp compassionate wonder deficiency talent vexation comprehend 
44,"They went by the road, for the plantation gate was far too serious an undertaking for any one not in the highest spirits for enterprise. On the way there was a good deal of that desultory talk, very sociable and interesting, that is apt to prevail between two people, who would never have chosen each other for companions, if they were not of the same family, but who are nevertheless very affectionate and companionable. Ethel was anxious to hear what her brother thought of papa’s spirits, and whether he talked in their drives.",go road plantation gate serious undertaking one high spirit enterprise way be good deal desultory talk sociable interesting apt prevail person choose other companion same family affectionate companionable anxious hear brother think spirit talk drive

62,"Thus they talked till they arrived at Cocksmoor, where poor Mrs. Taylor, inspirited by better reports of her husband and the hopes for her daughter, was like another woman. Richard was very careful not to raise false expectations, saying it all depended on Miss May and nurse, and what they thought of her strength and steadiness, but these cautions did not seem capable of damping the hopes of the smooth-haired Lucy, who stood smiling and curtseying. The twins were grown and improved, and Ethel supposed they would be brought to church on the next christening Sunday, but their mother looked helpless and hopeless about getting them so far, and how was she to get gossips? Ethel began to grow very indignant, but she was always shy of finding fault with poor people to their faces when she would not have done so to persons in her own station, and so she was silent, while Richard hoped they would be able to manage, and said it would be better not to wait another month for still worse weather and shorter days.",talk arrive poor inspirite good report husband hope daughter woman careful raise false expectation say depend nurse think strength steadiness caution seem capable damp hope smooth hair stand smile curtsey twin grow improve suppose bring church next christening mother look helpless hopeless get get gossip begin grow indignant shy find fault poor person face do person own station silent hope able manage say good wait month bad weather short day

A poor old woman sat groaning over the fire, and two children crouched, half-clothed, on the bare floor.",granny bad say boy proceeding further explanation lead way hovel try explain knowledge medicine case hereditary poor old woman sit groan fire child crouch half cloth bare floor

72,"Sam scratched his head, and answered nothing. His grandmother knew he was the age of her black bonnet, and as he looked about fifteen, Ethel honoured him and the bonnet accordingly, while Richard said he must be very glad to be able to maintain them all, at his age, and, promising to try to bring his father that way, since prescribing at second hand for such curious symptoms was more than could be expected, he took his leave.",scratch head answer grandmother know age black bonnet look honoure bonnet say glad able maintain age promise try bring father way prescribe second hand such curious symptom more expect take leave 
73,"“A wretched place,” said Richard, looking round. “I don’t know what help there is for the people. There’s no one to do any thing for them, and it is of no use to tell them to come to church when it it so far off, and there is so little room for them.”",wretch place say look know help be person be do thing use tell come church be little room 
74,"“It is miserable,” said Ethel; and all her thoughts during her last walk thither began to rush over her again, not effaced, but rather burned in, by all that had subsequently happened. She had said it should be her aim and effort to make Cocksmoor a Christian place. Such a resolve must not pass away lightly; she knew it must be acted on, but how? What would her present means--one sovereign--effect? Her fancies, rich and rare, had nearly been forgotten of late, but she might make them of use in time--in time, and here were hives of children growing up in heathenism. Suddenly an idea struck her--Richard, when at home, was a very diligent teacher in the Sunday-school at Stoneborough, though it was a thankless task, and he was the only gentleman so engaged, except the two clergymen--the other male teachers being a formal, grave, little baker, and one or two monitors.",miserable say thought last walk begin rush efface burn happen say aim effort make christian place resolve pass know act present means sovereign effect fancy rich rare forget late make use time time hive child grow heathenism idea strike home diligent teacher school thankless task only gentleman engage clergymen other male teacher formal grave little baker monitor

81,"“And, then, what is to become of Stoneborough school?”",become school 
82,"“I hate it,” exclaimed Ethel; then seeing Richard shocked, and finding she had spoken more vehemently than she intended--“It is not as bad for you among the boys, but, while that committee goes on it is not the least use to try to teach the girls right. Oh! the fusses about the books, and one’s way of teaching! And fancy how Mrs Ledwich used us. You know I went again last Sunday, for the first time, and there I found that class of Margaret’s, that she had just managed to get into some degree of nice order, taken so much pains with, taught so well. She had been telling me what to hear them--there it is given away to Fanny Anderson, who is no more fit to teach than that stick, and all Margaret’s work will be undone.

85,"“I am glad you did not tell him,” said Richard.",glad tell say 
86,"“I thought it would only tease him,” said Ethel, “and that he might call it a petty female squabble; and when Margaret is well, it will come right, if Fanny Anderson has not spoiled the girls in the meantime. It is all Mrs. Ledwich’s doing. How I did hate it when every one came up and shook hands with me, and asked after Margaret and papa, only just out of curiosity!”",think tease say call petty female squabble come spoiled girl meantime do hate one come shake hand ask curiosity

90,"The rendering of full justice conveyed in his tone so opened Ethel’s heart that she went on eagerly:--“The history of it is this. Last time we walked here, that day, I said, and I meant it, that I would never put it out of my head; I would go on doing and striving, and trying, till this place was properly cared for, and has a church and a clergyman. I believe it was a vow, Richard, I do believe it was,--and if one makes one, one must keep it. There it is.

93,"They walked home in silence, and when Richard warned her that she was not keeping her dress out of the dirt, it sounded like a sarcasm on her projects, and, with a slightly pettish manner, she raised the unfortunate skirt, its crape trimmings greatly bespattered with ruddy mud. Then recollecting how mamma would have shaken her head at that very thing, she regretted the temper she had betrayed, and in a larmoyante voice, sighed, “I wish I could pick my way better. Some people have the gift, you have hardly a splash, and I’m up to the ankles in mud.”",walk silence warn keep dress dirt sound sarcasm project pettish manner raise unfortunate skirt crape trimming bespatter ruddy mud recollect mamma shake head very thing regret temper betray larmoyante voice sigh wish pick way good person have gift have splash ankle mud

98,"They met Dr. May at the entrance of the town, very tired, and saying he had been a long tramp, all over the place, and Mrs. Hoxton had been boring him with her fancies.

As she did so, her father and brother came in--the former desiring Richard to come with him to the study, and write a note for him.

You have not told me about the girl.”",sober minded flight say know feeling dear know see plan answer reason try do tell girl 
117,"Ethel proceeded to tell the history. “There!” said Margaret cheerfully, “there are two ways of helping Cocksmoor already. Could you not make some clothes for the two grandchildren? I could help you a little, and then, if they were well clothed, you might get them to come to the Sunday-school. And as to the twins, I wonder what the hire of a cart would be to bring the christening party?

128,"Mary was happy to help, and Ethel was dressed and cheered by the time Dr. May came in, for a hurried visit and report of his doings; Flora followed on her way from her room. Then all went to tea, leaving Margaret to have a visit from the little ones under charge of nurse. Two hours’ stay with her, that precious time when she knew that sad as the talk often was, it was truly a comfort to him. It ended when ten o’clock struck, and he went down--Margaret hearing the bell, the sounds of the assembling servants, the shutting of the door, the stillness of prayer-time, the opening again, the feet moving off in different directions, then brothers and sisters coming in to kiss her and bid her good-night, nurse and Flora arranging her for the night, Flora coming to sleep in her little bed in the corner of the room, and, lastly, her father’s tender good-night, and melancholy look at her, and all was quiet, except the low voices and movements as Richard attended him in his own room.",happy help dress cheer time come hurry visit report doing follow way room go tea leave have visit little one charge nurse hour stay precious time know sad talk comfort end o'clock strike go hear bell sound assemble servant shutting door stillness prayer time opening foot move different direction brother sister come kiss bid good night nurse arrange night come sleep little bed corner room father tender good night melancholy look quiet low voice movement attend own room 
129,"Margaret could think: “Dear, dear Ethel, how noble and high she is! But I am afraid! It is what people call a difficult, dangerous age, and the grander she is, the greater danger of not managing her rightly. If those high purposes should run only into romance like mine, or grow out into eccentricities and unfemininesses, what a grievous pity it would be! And I, so little older, so much less clever, with just sympathy enough not to be a wise restraint--I am the person who has the responsibility, and oh, what shall I do? Mamma trusted to me to be a mother to them, papa looks to me, and I so unfit, besides this helplessness. But God sent it, and put me in my place. He made me lie here, and will raise me up if it is good, so I trust He will help me with my sisters.”",think dear dear noble high afraid person call difficult dangerous age grander great danger manage high purpose run romance grow eccentricity unfemininess grievous pity little old clever sympathy wise restraint person have responsibility do trust mother papa look unfit helplessness send put place make lie raise good trust help sister
