1,CHAPTER VIII.,
2," Nod still lay huddled up in his jacket, his small, hairy face all drawn and grey, his eyes tight-shut and sorrowful beneath their thick black lashes. Mishcha squatted over him, and put her head down close to his little body. ""He breathes no more, sister, than a moth or an Immamoosa-bud.""",nod lay huddle jacket small hairy face draw grey eye tight shut sorrowful thick black lash squatet put head little body breathe more sister moth bud 
3,"""Let us drag him out of his sheep-skin, and bury him in the snow,"" said Môha.",let drag sheep skin bury snow say 
4,"But Mishcha listened more closely still. ""I hear his heart beating; I hear his drowsy blood just come and go. But what is it that, sweeter than a panther's breath, smells so of Magic? We must not harm the little Mulgar, sister; he is cunning. A Meermut of Magic would soon return to plague us."" So she wrapped him up still closer in dry leaves and tree-moss, and opened his mouth to sprinkle a pinch of snow between his lips.",listen hear heart beating hear drowsy blood come go sweeter panther breath smell harm little sister cunn return plague wrap close dry leave tree moss open mouth sprinkle pinch snow lip 
5,"All that night and the next day Nod slept without stirring. But the evening after that, when the snow had ceased again, he opened his eyes and called ""Wallah, wallah!"" Mishcha hopped off and brought him snow in a plantain-leaf, and wrapped him up still warmer. But the little dry herbs and powdered root she put on his tongue he choked at, and could not swallow. His shoulder burned, he tossed to and fro with eyes blazing. Now he would start up and shout, ""Thumb, Thumb!"" then presently his face would all pucker up with fear, and he would scream, ""The fire, the fire!"" and then soon after he would be whispering, ""Muzza, muzza, mutta; kara mutta, mutta!"" just as if he were at home again in the little dried-up Portingal's hut.",night next day sleep stir evening snow cease open eye call hopp bring snow plantain leaf wrap warm little dry herb powder root put tongue choke swallow shoulder burn toss for eye blaze start shout face pucker fear scream fire fire whisper home little dry hut 
6,"Mishcha did all she could to soothe and quieten him. And at last she managed to make him swallow a little hard bright blue seed called Candar, which drives away fever and quiets dreams. But old Môha eyed him angrily, and wanted to throw him out into the forest to die. ""Who'd sleep in a jacket that a gibbering Mulgar has died in?"" she said.",do soothe quieten last manage make swallow little hard bright blue seed call drive fever quiet dream old eye want throw forest die sleep jacket gibbering die say 
7,"When the next night was nearly gone, but before it was yet day, Nod awoke, cool and clear, and stared into the musty darkness of the Dragon-tree, wondering in vain where he was. Only one small spark of light could he see--the red star Antares, that was now burning through a little rift in the bark. He thought he heard a faint rustling of dry leaves.",next night gone day awoke cool clear stare musty darkness tree wonder vain small spark light see red star burn little rift bark think hear faint rustling dry leave 
8,"""Hey, there!"" he called out. ""Where is Nod?""",call nod 
9,"""Hold your tongue, thieving Mulgar,"" cried an angry voice, ""and let honest folk sleep in peace.""",hold tongue thieving cry angry voice let honest folk sleep peace 
10,"""If I could see,"" Nod answered weakly, ""you wouldn't sleep much to-night, honest or no.""",see answer sleep much night honest 
11,"""You can't see,"" answered the voice softly, ""because, my man of bones, you are dead and buried under the snow.""",see answer voice man bone dead bury snow 
12,"Nod grew cold. He pinched his legs; he opened and shut his mouth, and took long, deep breaths; then he laughed. ""It's none so bad, then, being dead, Voice-of-Kindness,"" he said cheerfully, ""if it weren't for this sore shoulder of mine.""",nod grow cold pinch leg open shut mouth take long deep breath laugh bad dead say sore shoulder 
13,"But to this the morose voice made no answer. Not yet, even, could Nod remember all that had happened. ""Hey, there!"" he called out again presently, ""who buried me, then?""",morose voice make answer remember happen call bury 
14,"""Buried you? Why, Mishcha and Môha, the old witch-hares, who found you snuffling in the snow in your stolen sheep's-coat--Mishcha and Môha, who wouldn't touch monkey-skin, not for a grove of green Candar-trees.""",bury old witch hare find snuffle snow stolen sheep coat touch monkey skin grove green tree 
15,"""I remember Môha,"" said Nod meekly, ""a gentle and sleek, a very, very handsome old Quatta. And is she dead, too?""",remember say gentle sleek handsome old dead 
16,But again the sour voice made no reply.,sour voice make reply 
17,"""Once,"" said Nod, in a little while, ""I had two brave brothers. I wonder where those Mulla-mulgars are now?""",say little while have brave brother wonder mulgar 
18,"""He wonders,"" said the voice slowly--""he _wonders_! Frizzling, frizzling, frizzling, my pretty Talk-by-Night, with seven smoking Gelica-nuts for company on the spit.""",wonder say voice frizzling frizzle frizzle pretty talk night smoking nut company spit 
19,"At this Nod fell silent. He lay quaking in his warm, rustling bed, with puckered forehead and restless eyes, wondering if the voice had told him the truth, while daybreak stole abroad in the forest.",nod fall silent lay quak warm rustle bed pucker forehead restless eye wonder voice tell truth daybreak steal forest 
20,"When dusk began to stir within the Dragon-tree, Mishcha awoke and came and looked at him.",dusk begin stir tree awoke come look 
21,"She hearkened at his ribs and mouth, and there seemed, Nod thought, a little kindness in her ways. So he put out his shrunken hand, and said: ""Tell me truly, witch-hare. A voice in the night was merry with me, and told me for pleasure that my brothers Thumb and Thimble were frizzling on the cannibal Minimuls' spits. That is not true?""",hearken rib mouth seem think little kindness way put shrunken hand say tell witch hare voice night merry tell pleasure brother frizzle cannibal spit true 
22,"""'One long and lean,'"" said Mishcha, ""'one fat and very heavy, and one sly and tiny, a Nizza-neela.' Here's the Nizza-neela Mulla-mulgar; I know nothing of the others.""",long lean say fat heavy sly tiny know other 
23,"""Ah, then,"" said Nod, starting up out of his bed, ""I must be off to look for them. Their Little Horses ran faster than mine. And mine, he was a coward, and nibbled my sore shoulder to make me loose hold. But he could not buck or scrape me off, witch-hare, tried he never so hard. I must be off at once to look for my brothers. If they are dead, then I die too.""",say start bed look little run fast coward nibble sore shoulder make lose hold buck scrape witch hare try look brother dead die 
24,"""Well, well,"" said the old hare, ""it's sad to die, but it's sadder to live alone. But tell me first one thing,"" she said. ""Where have these strange Mulgars come from in their rags and bravery?""",say old hare sad die sadder live tell first thing say strange come rag bravery 
25,"""Ohé,"" said Nod, and told her who they were.",say tell 
26,"""And tell me just one thing more,"" she said, when he had finished. ""Where, little Mulgar, is all this Magic I can smell?""",tell thing more say finish little smell 
27,"And at that question Nod thought he could never keep from laughing. But he looked very solemn, and said: ""There are three things, old hare, I always carry about with me--one is my sheep's-jacket, one is hunger, and the other is Magic; and the Magic just now is where my hunger is.""",question think keep laugh look solemn say be thing old hare carry sheep jacket hunger other hunger 
28,"The old hare eyed him narrowly. ""Well,"" she said, ""wherever it is, if it hadn't been for the Magic, little Mulgar, the Jaccatrays would have been quarrelling over your bones. But there! remember old Mishcha sometimes in your travels, who hated every Mulgar except just one little one!"" She bade him be very quiet, for her sister, after the night's talk, still lay fast asleep, her eyes wide open, in the gloom.",old hare eye say little quarrell bone remember old travel hate little one bid quiet sister night talk lay eye open gloom 
29,"And she put Ukka-nuts, and dried berries and fruits of many kinds, and seven pepper-pods into his pockets, and buttoned the flaps. And she gave him also some powdered physic-nuts, three bright-blue Candar-seeds, and a little bunch of faded saffron-flower for a protection against the teeth of the dreaded Coccadrillo. She tied up his shoulder with soft clean moss, and fetched him a stout stick for cudgel out of the forest. And then she hobbled out with him to see him on his way. Dawn lay rosy and still upon the snow-laden branches.",put nut dry berries fruit many kind pepper pod pocket button flap give powder physic nut bright blue seed little bunch fade saffron flower protection tooth dread tie shoulder soft clean moss fetched stout stick cudgel forest hobble see way lay rosy snow laden branch 
30,"""Where burns the Sulemnāgar, old hare?"" said Nod, pretending utter bravery. And the wise old Quatta hare pointed out to him where still the Sulemnāgar gleamed faint and silver above the glistening trees.",burn old hare say pretend utter bravery wise old hare point gleam faint silver glisten tree 
31,"So Nod thanked her, went forward a few paces, and stepped back to thank her again; then set out truly and for good.",thank go few pace step thank set good 
32,"He walked very cautiously, spying about him as he went. The red sun glinted on his cudgel. Once he saw a last night's leopard's track in the snow. So he roved his eyes aloft as well as to left and right of him, lest she should be lying in wait, crouched in the branches. A troop of Skeetoes pelted him with Ukka-nuts. But these, as fast as they threw them down, he gathered up and put into his bulging pockets, and waved his cap at them for thanks. They gibbered and mocked at him, and flung more nuts. ""So long as it isn't stones, my long-tailed friends,"" he said to himself, ""I will not throw back.""",walk spying go red sun glint cudgel see last night leopard track snow rove eye left right lie wait crouch branch troop pelt nut throw gather put bulg pocket wave cap thanks gibber mock flung more nut stone long tail friend say throw 
33,"After a while he came to where Cullum and Samarak grew so dense amid the tree-trunks that he could scarcely walk upright. But he determined, as his mother had bidden him, to keep from stooping on to his fours as long as ever he could. Tumbling Numnuddies startled him, calling in the air. And once a clouded vulture with wings at least six cudgels wide dropped like a stone upon a leafless Bōōbab-branch, and watched him gloatingly go limping by.",while come grow dense tree trunk walk determine mother bidd keep stoop four tumble startle call air cloude vulture wing least cudgel drop stone leafless bōōbab branch watch go limp 
34,"He sat down in his loneliness and rested, and nibbled one of Mishcha's nuts. But try as he might, he could not swallow much. When once more he set out, for a long way some skulking beast which he could not plainly see stalked through the nodding grasses a few paces distant from him, but side by side. He flourished his cudgel, and sang softly the Mulla-mulgars' Journey-Song which Seelem had taught him long ago:",sit loneliness rest nibble nut try swallow much set long way skulking beast see stalked nodding grasse few pace distant side side flourish cudgel sing mulgar teach 
35,"    ""That one      Alone      Who's dared, and gone      To seek the Magic Wonderstone,      No fear,      Or care,      Or black despair,      Shall heed until his journey's done.",one alone dare gone seek fear care black despair heed journey do 
36,"    ""Who knows      Where blows      The Mulgars' rose,      In valleys 'neath unmelting snows--      All secrets      He      Shall pierce and see,      And walk unharmed where'er he goes.""",know blow rise valley neath unmelt snow secret pierce see walk unharmed go 
37,"Whether it was the Wonderstone under his breast-bone, on the sight of his cudgel, or a distaste for his shrill voice and skinniness, Nod could not tell, but in a little while, when he stopped a moment to peer between the thick streamers of Samarak, the secret beast was gone. Day drew on. He saw no tracks in the snow, except of wild pig and long-snouted Brackanolls. The only sound he heard was the falling of frosted clots of snow from the branches of the trees and the sad, continuous ""Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!"" of the little rust-coloured Bittock amid the sunlit snow. He did not dare now to rest, though his feet grew more painful at every step, and his poisoned shoulder itched and ached.",breast bone sight cudgel distaste shrill voice skinniness tell little while stop moment peer thick streamer secret beast gone day draw see track snow wild pig long snout only sound hear falling frost clot snow branch tree sad continuous little rust coloured sunlit snow dare rest foot grow painful step poison shoulder itch ach 
38,"He stumbled on, scarcely heeding where his footsteps were leading him. Mulgar flies, speckled and humped, roused by the cloudless sun, buzzed round his eyes and bit and stung him. And suddenly his heart stood still at sight of seven amber and spotted beasts standing amid the grasses, casting a league-long shadow with their necks--such beasts as he had never seen before. But they were busy feeding, their heads and tiny horns and lustrous eyes half hidden in the foliage of the branches. Nod stared in fear and wonder, and passed their arbour very softly by.",stumble heed footstep lead fly speckle hump rouse cloudless sun buzz eye bit st heart stand sight amber spot beast stand grasse cast league long shadow neck such beast see busy feeding head tiny horn lustrous eye half hide foliage branch stare fear wonder pass arbour 
39,"Night began to fall, and the long-beaked bats to flit in their leathery hoods, seeking small birds and beasts to quench their thirst. It seemed now to Nod, his brave heart fallen, that he was utterly forsaken. Darkness had always sent him scuttling home to the Portingal's hut when he was little. How often his mother had told him that Nōōmanossi with his luring harp-strings roamed these farther forests, and strange beasts, too, that never show their faces to the sun! Worse still, as he lifted his poor wrinkled forehead to the tree-tops to catch the last beams of day, he felt a dreadful presence around him. Leopard it was not, nor Gunga, nor Minimul. He stood still, his left hand resting on its knuckles in the snow, his right clutching his cudgel, and leaning his round ear sidelong, he listened and listened. He put down his cudgel, and stood upright, his hands clasped behind his neck, and lifting his flat nose, sniffed and sniffed again the scarcely-stirring air. There was a smell, faint and strange. He turned as if to rush away, to hide himself--anywhere away from this brooding, terrifying smell, when, as if it were a little voice speaking beneath his ribs, he heard the words: ""Fear not, Ummanodda; press on, press on!"" He took up his cudgel with a groan, and limped quickly forward, and in an instant before he could start back, before even he could cry out, he heard a click, his foot slipped, out of the leaves whipped something smooth and shining, and he was jerked into the air, caught, bound fast in a snare.",night begin fall long beak bat flit leathery hood seek small bird beast quench thirst seem brave heart fall forsaken send scuttle hut little mother tell lure harp string roam far forest strange beast show face sun bad lift poor wrinkled forehead tree top catch last beam day feel dreadful presence stand left hand rest knuckle snow right clutch cudgel lean round ear sidelong listen listen put cudgel stand hand clasp neck lift flat nose sniff sniff stir air be smell faint strange turn rush hide brooding terrifying smell little voice speak rib hear word fear press press take cudgel groan limp instant start cry hear click foot slip leave whip smooth shine jerk air catch bind snare 
40,"He writhed and kicked, he spat and hissed. But the more he struggled, the tighter drew the cord round his neck. Everywhere, faint and trembling, rose the strange and dreadful unknown smell. He hung quite still. And as he dangled in pain, a night-wandering Bittock on a branch above him called piteously: ""Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!""",writh kick spat hiss struggle tight draw cord neck faint tremble rise strange dreadful unknown smell hang dangle pain night wonder branch call 
41,"""Why do you mock me, my friend?"" groaned Nod.",mock friend groan 
42,"""Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!"" wailed the Bittock, and hopping down slowly, perched herself before his face. Her black eye gleamed. She clapped her tiny wings above her head, and softly let them fold. ""Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!"" she cried again.",wail hopping perch face black eye gleam clapp tiny wing head let fold cry 
43,"Nod stared in a rage: ""Oo-ee, oo-ee!"" he mocked her feebly. ""Who's caught me in this trap? Why do you come mocking me, swinging here to die? Put out my eyes, Bird of Sorrow. Nod's tired of being Nod.""",stare rage mock catch trap come mocking swing die put eye bird nod tired nod 
44,"The little bird seemed to listen, with rusty poll poked forward. She puffed out her feathers, raised her pointed bill, and piercingly into the shadows rang out her trembling voice again. ""Oo-ee, oo-ee, oo-ee!"" she sang, spread her wings, and left Nod quite alone.",little bird seem listen rusty poll poke puff feather raise point bill shadow ring tremble voice sing spread wing leave alone 
45,"His thong twitched softly. He shut his eyes. And once again, borne on the faint cold wind, that smell came sluggishly to his nostrils. His fears boiled up. His hair grew wet on his head. And suddenly he heard a distant footfall. Nearer and nearer--not panther's, nor Gunga's, nor Ephelanto's. And then some ancient voice whispered in his memory: ""Oomgar, Oomgar!"" Man!",thong twitch shut eye borne faint cold wind smell come nostril fear boil hair grow wet head hear distant footfall nearer panther ancient voice whisper memory man
