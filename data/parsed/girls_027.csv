1,CHAPTER 27. TRUANTS.,
2,"It was a proverbial saying in the school that Annie Forest was always in hot water; she was exceedingly daring, and loved what she called a spice of danger.  This was not the first stolen picnic at which Annie reigned as queen, but this was the largest she had yet organised, and this was the first time she had dared to go out of doors with her satellites.",proverbial saying school hot water dare love call spice danger first stolen picnic reign queen large organised first time dare go door satellite 
3,"Hitherto these naughty sprites had been content to carry their baskets full of artfully-concealed provisions to a disused attic which was exactly over the box-room, and consequently out of reach of the inhabited part of the house.  Here, making a table of a great chest which stood in the attic, they feasted gloriously, undisturbed by the musty smell or by the innumerable spiders and beetles which disappeared rapidly in all directions at their approach; but when Annie one day incautiously suggested that on summer nights the outside world was all at their disposal, they began to discover flaws in their banqueting-hall.  Mary Price said the musty smell made her half sick; Phyllis declared that at the sight of a spider she invariably turned faint; and Susan Drummond was heard to murmur that in a dusty, fusty attic even meringues scarcely kept her awake.  The girls were all wild to try a midnight picnic out of doors, and Annie in her present mood, was only too eager for the fun.",naughty sprite content carry basket full conceal provision disuse attic box room reach inhabit part house make table great chest stand attic feast undisturbed musty smell innumerable spider beetle disappear direction approach day suggest summer night outside world disposal begin discover flaw banqueting hall say musty smell make half sick declare sight spider turn faint hear murmur dusty fusty attic meringue keep girl wild try midnight picnic door present mood eager fun 
4,"With her usual skill she organised the whole undertaking, and eight agitated, slightly frightened, but much excited girls retired to their rooms that night.  Annie, in her heart of hearts, felt rather sorry that Mrs Willis should happen to be away; dim ideas of honour and trustworthiness were still stirring in her breast, but she dared not think now.",usual skill organised whole undertaking agitated frighten excited girl retire room night heart heart feel sorry happen dim idea honour trustworthiness stir breast think 
5,"The night was in every respect propitious; the moon would not rise until after twelve, so the little party could get away under the friendly shelter of the darkness, and soon afterwards have plenty of light to enjoy their stolen feast.  They had arranged to make no movement until close on midnight, and then they were all to meet in a passage which belonged to the kitchen regions, and where there was a side door which opened directly into the shrubbery.  This door was not very often unlocked, and Annie had taken the key from its place in the lock some days before.  She went to bed with her companions at nine o'clock as usual, and presently fell into an uneasy doze.  She awoke to hear the great clock in the hall strike eleven and a few minutes afterwards she heard Miss Danesbury's footsteps retiring to her room at the other end of the passage.",night respect propitious moon rise little party get friendly shelter darkness have plenty light enjoy steal feast arrange make movement close midnight meet passage belong kitchen region be side door open shrubbery door unlock take key place lock day go bed companion o'clock usual fall uneasy doze awoke hear great clock hall strike few minute hear footstep retire room other end passage 
6,"""Danesbury is always the last to go to bed,"" whispered Annie to herself; ""I can get up presently.""",last go bed whisper get 
7,"She lay for another twenty minutes, then, softly rising, began to put on her clothes in the dark.  Over her dress she fastened her waterproof, and placed a close-fitting brown velvet cap on her curly head.  Having dressed herself, she approached Susan's bed with the intention of rousing her.",lay minute rise begin put clothes dark dress fasten waterproof place close fitting brown velvet cap curly head dress approach bed intention rouse 
8,"""I shall have fine work now,"" she said, ""and shall probably have to resort to cold water.  Really, if Susy proves too hard to wake, I shall let her sleep on--her drowsiness is past bearing.""",have fine work say have resort cold water prove hard wake let sleep drowsiness past bear 
9,"Annie, however, was considerably startled when she discovered that Miss Drummond's bed was without an occupant.",startle discover bed occupant 
10,"At this moment the room door was very softly opened, and Susan, fully dressed and in her waterproof, came in.",moment room door open dress waterproof come 
11,"""Why, Susy, where have you been?"" exclaimed Annie.  ""Fancy you being awake a moment before it is necessary!""",exclaim fancy awake moment necessary 
12,"""For once in a way I was restless,"" replied Miss Drummond, ""so I thought I would get up, and take a turn in the passage outside.  The house is perfectly quiet, and we can come now; most of the girls are already waiting at the side door.""",way restless reply think get take turn passage house quiet come most girl wait side door 
13,"Holding their shoes in their hands, Annie and Susan went noiselessly down the carpetless stairs, and found the remaining six girls waiting for them by the side door.",holding shoe hand go carpetless stair find remain girl wait side door 
14,"""Rover is our one last danger now,"" said Annie, as she fitted the well-oiled key into the lock.  ""Put on your shoes, girls, and let me out first; I think I can manage him.""",last danger say fit oil key lock put shoe girl let think manage 
15,She was alluding to a great mastiff which was usually kept chained up by day.  Phyllis and Norah laid their hands on her arm.,allude great mastiff keep chain day lay hand arm 
16,"""Oh, Annie, oh, love, suppose he seizes on you, and knocks you down--oh, dare you venture?""",suppose seize knock venture 
17,"""Let me go,"" said Annie a little contemptuously; ""you don't suppose I am afraid?""",let go say little suppose afraid 
18,"Her fingers trembled, for her nerves were highly strung; but she managed to unlock the door and draw back the bolts, and, opening it softly, she went out into the silent night.",finger tremble nerve string manage unlock door draw bolt open go silent night 
19,"Very slight as the noise she made was, it had aroused the watchful Rover, who trotted around swiftly to know what was the matter.  But Annie had made friends with Rover long ago by stealing to his kennel door and feeding him, and she had now but to say ""Rover"" in her melodious voice, and throw her arms around his neck, to completely subvert his morals.",slight noise make arouse watchful trotet know matter make friend steal kennel door feed have say melodious voice throw arm neck subvert moral 
20,"""He is one of us, girls,"" she called in a whisper to her companions; ""come out.  Rover will be as naughty as the rest of us, and go with us as our bodyguard to the fairies' field.  Now, I will lock the door on the outside, and we can be off.  Ah, the moon is getting up splendidly, and when we have secured Betty's basket, we shall be quite out of reach of danger.""",girl call whisper companion come naughty rest go bodyguard fairy field lock door outside moon get secure basket reach danger 
21,"At Annie's words of encouragement the seven girls ventured out.  She locked the door, put the key into her pocket, and, holding Rover by his collar; led the way in the direction of the laurel-bush.  The basket was secured, and Susan, to her disgust, and Mary Morris were elected for the first part of the way to carry it.  The young truants then walked quickly down the avenue until they came to a turn-stile which led into a wood.",word encouragement girl venture lock door put key pocket hold collar lead way direction laurel bush basket secure disgust elect first part way carry young truant walk avenue come turn stile lead wood
