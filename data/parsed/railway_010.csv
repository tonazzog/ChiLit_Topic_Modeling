2," When they first went to live at Three Chimneys, the children had talked a great deal about their Father, and had asked a great many questions about him, and what he was doing and where he was and when he would come home. Mother always answered their questions as well as she could. But as the time went on they grew to speak less of him. Bobbie had felt almost from the first that for some strange miserable reason these questions hurt Mother and made her sad. And little by little the others came to have this feeling, too, though they could not have put it into words.",go live child talk great deal father ask great many question do come mother answer question time go grow speak less feel first strange miserable reason question hurt make sad little little other come have feeling put word 
3,"One day, when Mother was working so hard that she could not leave off even for ten minutes, Bobbie carried up her tea to the big bare room that they called Mother’s workshop. It had hardly any furniture. Just a table and a chair and a rug. But always big pots of flowers on the window-sills and on the mantelpiece. The children saw to that. And from the three long uncurtained windows the beautiful stretch of meadow and moorland, the far violet of the hills, and the unchanging changefulness of cloud and sky.",day mother work leave minute carry tea big bare room call mother workshop have furniture table chair rug big pot flower window sill mantelpiece child see long uncurtained window beautiful stretch meadow moorland far violet hill unchanging changefulness cloud sky

22,"“Bobbie dear,” said Mother, still leaning her head against her, “I’ll tell you. Besides parting from Father, he and I have had a great sorrow--oh, terrible--worse than anything you can think of, and at first it did hurt to hear you all talking of him as if everything were just the same.

38,"When Bobbie came to think it all over, she tried not to wonder what the great trouble was. But she could not always help it. Father was not dead--like poor Uncle Edward--Mother had said so. And he was not ill, or Mother would have been with him. Being poor wasn’t the trouble. Bobbie knew it was something nearer the heart than money could be.",come think try wonder great trouble help father dead poor mother say ill mother poor trouble know heart money

42,"Phyllis had planted mignonette and nasturtium and Virginia Stock in hers. The seeds came up, and though they looked just like weeds, Phyllis believed that they would bear flowers some day.

44,"Peter sowed vegetable seeds in his--carrots and onions and turnips. The seed was given to him by the farmer who lived in the nice black-and-white, wood-and-plaster house just beyond the bridge. He kept turkeys and guinea fowls, and was a most amiable man. But Peter’s vegetables never had much of a chance, because he liked to use the earth of his garden for digging canals, and making forts and earthworks for his toy soldiers. And the seeds of vegetables rarely come to much in a soil that is constantly disturbed for the purposes of war and irrigation.",sow vegetable seed carrot onion turnip seed give farmer live nice black white wood plaster house bridge keep turkey guinea fowl amiable man vegetable have much chance like use earth garden digg canal make fort earthwork toy soldier seed vegetable come much soil disturb purpose war irrigation 
45,"Bobbie planted rose-bushes in her garden, but all the little new leaves of the rose-bushes shrivelled and withered, perhaps because she moved them from the other part of the garden in May, which is not at all the right time of year for moving roses. But she would not own that they were dead, and hoped on against hope, until the day when Perks came up to see the garden, and told her quite plainly that all her roses were as dead as doornails.",plant rose bush garden little new leave rose bush shrivell wither move other part garden right time year move rose own dead hope hope day come see garden tell rose dead doornail

67,"“Take the horrid rake, then,” was the best she could manage. And she suddenly let go her hold on the handle.
