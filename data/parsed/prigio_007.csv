1,CHAPTER VI. _What Happened to Prince Prigio in Town_,happen 
2,"BY this time the prince was very hungry. The town was just three miles off; but he had such a royal appetite, that he did not like to waste it on bad cookery, and the people of the royal town were bad cooks. “I wish I were in ‘The Bear,’ at Gluck-stein,” said he to himself; for he remembered that there was a very good cook there. But, then, the town was twenty-one leagues away--sixty-three long miles!",time prince hungry town mile have royal appetite like waste bad cookery person royal town bad cook wish say remember be good cook town league long mile 
3,"No sooner had the prince said this, and taken just three steps, than he found himself at the door of the “Bear Inn” at Gluckstein!",have prince say take step find door 
4,"“This is the most extraordinary dream,” said he to himself; for he was far too clever, of course, to believe in seven-league boots. Yet he had a pair on at that very moment, and it was they which had carried him in three strides from the palace to Gluckstein!",extraordinary dream say clever course believe league boot have pair very moment carry stride palace 
5,"The truth is, that the prince, in looking about the palace for clothes, had found his way into that very old lumber-room where the magical gifts of the fairies had been thrown by his clever mother, who did not believe in them. But this, of course, the prince did not know.",truth prince look palace clothes find way old lumber room magical gift fairy throw clever mother believe course prince know 
6,"Now you should be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when you say you _want_ to go a long distance. Otherwise they would be very inconvenient--when you only want to cross the room, for example. Perhaps this has not been explained to you by your governess?",tell league boot take prodigious step say _want go long distance inconvenient want cross room example explain governess 
7,"Well, the prince walked into “The Bear,” and it seemed odd to him that nobody took any notice of him. And yet his face was as well known as that of any man in Pantouflia; for everybody had seen it, at least in pictures. He was so puzzled by not being attended to as usual, that _he quite forgot to take off his cap_.",prince walk seem odd take notice face know man see least picture puzzled attend usual forget take cap_ 
8," He sat down at a table, however, and shouted “_Kellner!_” at which all the waiters jumped, and looked round in every direction, but nobody came to him. At first he thought they were too busy, but presently another explanation occurred to him.",sit table shout waiter jump look direction come first think busy explanation occur 
9,"“The king,” said he to himself, “has threatened to execute anybody who speaks to me, or helps me in any way. Well, I don’t mean to starve in the midst of plenty, anyhow; here goes!”",king say threaten execute speak help way mean starve midst plenty go 
10,"The prince rose, and went to the table in the midst of the room, where a huge roast turkey had just been placed. He helped himself to half the breast, some sausages, chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, potatoes, and a bottle of red wine--Burgundy. He then went back to a table in a corner, where he dined very well, nobody taking any notice of him. When he had finished, he sat watching the other people dining, and smoking his cigarette. As he was sitting thus, a very tall man, an officer in the uniform of the Guards, came in, and, walking straight to the prince’s table, said: “Kellner, clean this table, and bring in the bill of fare.”",prince rise go table midst room huge roast turkey place help breast sausages chestnut stuff bread sauce potato bottle red wine go table corner dine take notice finish sit watch other person dine smoke cigarette sit tall man officer uniform come walk prince table say clean table bring bill fare 
11,"With these words, the officer sat down suddenly in the prince’s lap, as if he did not see him at all. He was a heavy man, and the prince, enraged at the insult, pushed him away and jumped to his feet. As he did so, _his cap dropped off_. The officer fell on his knees at once, crying:",word officer sit prince lap see heavy man prince enrage insult push jump foot do cap drop officer fall knee cry 
12,"“Pardon, my prince, pardon! I never saw you!”",pardon prince pardon see 
13,This was more than the prince could be expected to believe.,more prince expect believe 
14,"“Nonsense! Count Frederick von Matterhorn,” he said; “you must be intoxicated. Sir! you have insulted your prince and your superior officer. Consider yourself under arrest! You shall be sent to a prison to-morrow.”",nonsense count say intoxicated insult prince superior officer consider arrest send prison 
15,"On this, the poor officer appealed piteously to everybody in the tavern. They all declared that they had not seen the prince, nor ever had an idea that he was doing them the honour of being in the neighbourhood of their town.",poor officer appeal tavern declare see prince have idea do honour neighbourhood town 
16,"More and more offended, and convinced that there was a conspiracy to annoy and insult him, the prince shouted for the landlord, called for his bill, threw down his three pieces of gold without asking for change, and went into the street.",more offend convince be conspiracy annoy insult prince shout landlord call bill throw piece gold ask change go street 
17,"“It is a disgraceful conspiracy,” he said. “The king shall answer for this! I shall write to the newspapers at once!”",disgraceful conspiracy say king answer write newspaper 
18,"He was not put in a better temper by the way in which people hustled him in the street. They ran against him exactly as if they did not see him, and then staggered back in the greatest surprise, looking in every direction for the person they had jostled. In one of these encounters, the prince pushed so hard against a poor old beggar woman that she fell down. As he was usually most kind and polite, he pulled off his cap to beg her pardon, when, behold, the beggar woman gave one dreadful scream, and fainted! A crowd was collecting, and the prince, forgetting that he had thrown down all his money in the tavern, pulled out his purse. Then he remembered what he had done, and expected to find it empty; but, lo, there were three pieces of gold in it! Overcome with surprise, he thrust the money into the woman’s hand, and put on his cap again. In a moment the crowd, which had been staring at him, rushed away in every direction, with cries of terror, declaring that there was a magician in the town, and a fellow who could appear and disappear at pleasure!",put good temper way person hustle street run see stagger great surprise look direction person jostle encounter prince push poor old beggar woman fall kind polite pull cap beg pardon beggar woman give dreadful scream faint crowd collect prince forget throw money tavern pull purse remember do expect find empty be piece gold overcome surprise thrust money woman hand put cap moment crowd stare rush direction cry terror declare be magician town fellow appear disappear pleasure 
19," By this time, you or I, or anyone who was not so extremely clever as Prince Prigio, would have understood what was the matter. He had put on, without knowing it, not only the seven-league boots, but the cap of darkness, and had taken Fortunatus’s purse, which could never be empty, however often you took all the money out. All those and many other delightful wares the fairies had given him at his christening, and the prince had found them in the dark garret. But the prince was so extremely wise, and learned, and scientific, that he did not believe in fairies, nor in fairy gifts.",time clever understand matter put know league boot cap darkness take purse empty take money many other delightful ware fairy give christening prince find dark garret prince wise learn scientific believe fairy fairy gift 
20,"“It is indigestion,” he said to himself: “those sausages were not of the best; and that Burgundy was extremely strong. Things are not as they appear.”",indigestion say sausages good strong thing appear 
21,"Here, as he was arguing with himself, he was nearly run over by a splendid carriage and six, the driver of which never took the slightest notice of him. Annoyed at this, the prince leaped up behind, threw down the two footmen, who made no resistance, and so was carried to the door of a magnificent palace. He was determined to challenge the gentleman who was in the carriage; but, noticing that he had a very beautiful young lady with him, whom he had never seen before, he followed them into the house, not wishing to alarm the girl, and meaning to speak to the gentleman when he found him alone.",argue run splendid carriage driver take slight notice annoy prince leap throw footmen make resistance carry door magnificent palace determined challenge gentleman carriage notice have beautiful young lady see follow house wish alarm girl mean speak gentleman find 
22,"A great ball was going on; but, as usual, nobody took any notice of the prince. He walked among the guests, being careful not to jostle them, and listening to their conversation.",great ball go usual take notice prince walk guest careful jostle listen conversation 
23,"It was all about himself! Everyone had heard of his disgrace, and almost everyone cried “Serve him right!” They said that the airs he gave himself were quite unendurable--that nothing was more rude than to be always in the right--that cleverness might be carried far too far--that it was better even to be born stupid (“Like the rest of you,” thought the prince); and, in fact, nobody had a good word for him.",hear disgrace cry serve right say air give unendurable rude right cleverness carry good bear stupid rest think prince fact have good word 
24,"Yes, one had! It was the pretty lady of the carriage. I never could tell you how pretty she was. She was tall, with cheeks like white roses blushing: she had dark hair, and very large dark-grey eyes, and her face was the kindest in the world! The prince first thought how nice and good she looked, even before he thought how pretty she looked. _She_ stood up for Prince Prigio when her partner would speak ill of him. She had never seen the prince, for she was but newly come to Pantouflia; but she declared that it was his _misfortune_, not his fault, to be so clever. “And, then, think how hard they made him work at school! Besides,” said this kind young lady, “I hear he is extremely handsome, and very brave; and he has a good heart, for he was kind, I have heard, to a poor boy, and did all his examination papers for him, so that the boy passed first in _everything_. And now he is Minister for Education, though he can’t do a line of Greek prose!”",have pretty lady carriage tell tall cheek white rose blush have dark hair large dark grey eye face kindest world prince think nice good look think pretty look stand partner speak ill see prince come declare _misfortune_ fault clever think make work school say kind young lady hear handsome brave have good heart kind hear poor boy do examination paper boy pass do line greek prose 
25,"The prince blushed at this, for he knew his conduct had not been honourable. But he at once fell over head and ears in love with the young lady, a thing he had never done in his life before, because--he said--“women were so stupid!” You see he was so clever!",prince blush know conduct honourable fall head ear love young lady thing do life say woman stupid see clever 
26,"Now, at this very moment--when the prince, all of a sudden, was as deep in love as if he had been the stupidest officer in the room--an extraordinary thing happened! Something seemed to give a whirr! in his brain, and in one instant _he knew all about it!_ He believed in fairies and fairy gifts, and understood that his cap was the cap of darkness, and his shoes the seven-league boots, and his purse the purse of Fortunatus! He had read about those things in historical books: but now he believed in them.",very moment prince deep love stupidest officer room extraordinary thing happen seem give whirr brain instant know believe fairy fairy gift understand cap cap darkness shoe league boot purse purse read thing historical book believe
