2, I hope you don’t mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta. The fact is I am growing very fond of her. The more I observe her the more I love her. And I notice all sorts of things about her that I like.,hope mind tell good deal fact grow fond more observe more love notice sort thing like 
3,"For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people happy. And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare accomplishment. Also she had the power of silent sympathy. That sounds rather dull, I know, but it’s not so dull as it sounds. It just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and to love you extra on that account, without bothering you by telling you all the time how sorry she is for you. That was what Bobbie was like. She knew that Mother was unhappy--and that Mother had not told her the reason. So she just loved Mother more and never said a single word that could let Mother know how earnestly her little girl wondered what Mother was unhappy about. This needs practice. It is not so easy as you might think.",instance anxious make other person happy keep secret rare accomplishment have power silent sympathy sound dull know dull sound mean person able know unhappy love extra account bother tell time sorry know mother unhappy mother tell reason love mother more say single word let mother know little girl wonder mother unhappy need practice easy think 
4,"Whatever happened--and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things happened--such as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always had these thoughts at the back of her mind. “Mother’s unhappy. Why? I don’t know. She doesn’t want me to know. I won’t try to find out. But she IS unhappy. Why? I don’t know. She doesn’t--” and so on, repeating and repeating like a tune that you don’t know the stopping part of.",happen sort nice pleasant ordinary thing happen such picnic game bun tea have thought back mind mother unhappy know want know try find unhappy know repeat repeat tune know stop part 
5,The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybody’s thoughts. All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members of Parliament had answered Mother’s letters as politely as they knew how; but none of them could tell where the wife and children of Mr. Szezcpansky would be likely to be. (Did I tell you that the Russian’s very Russian name was that?),russian gentleman take good deal thought editor secretary answer mother letter know tell wife child likely tell russian name 
6,"Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described by different people. Some of them call it interfering in other people’s business--and some call it “helping lame dogs over stiles,” and some call it “loving-kindness.” It just means trying to help people.",have quality hear describe different person call interfere other person business call help lame dog stile call loving kindness mean try help person 
7,"She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the Russian gentleman to find his wife and children. He had learned a few words of English now. He could say “Good morning,” and “Good night,” and “Please,” and “Thank you,” and “Pretty,” when the children brought him flowers, and “Ver’ good,” when they asked him how he had slept.",rack brain think way help russian gentleman find wife child learn few word say good morning good night thank child bring flower good ask sleep 
8,"The way he smiled when he “said his English,” was, Bobbie felt, “just too sweet for anything.” She used to think of his face because she fancied it would help her to some way of helping him. But it did not. Yet his being there cheered her because she saw that it made Mother happier.",way smile say feel sweet use think face fancy help way help cheer see make mother happy 
9,"“She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us,” said Bobbie. “And I know she hated to let him have Father’s clothes. But I suppose it ‘hurt nice,’ or she wouldn’t have.”",like have good say know hate let have clothes suppose hurt nice have 
10,"For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and Phyllis had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red flannel flags, Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering, seeing again that horrible mound, and the poor, dear trustful engine rushing on towards it--just thinking that it was doing its swift duty, and that everything was clear and safe. And then a warm thrill of pleasure used to run through her at the remembrance of how she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel petticoats had really saved everybody.",many many night day save train wreck wave little red flannel flag use wake scream shiver see horrible mound poor dear trustful engine rush think do swift duty clear safe warm thrill pleasure use run remembrance red flannel petticoat save

It’s only clumsy things like tablecloths and sheets that have to be rubbed.”",say shocked rub muslin put boil soap hot water make frothy lathery shake muslin squeeze dirt come clumsy thing tablecloth sheet have rub

50,"When at last--it seemed a very long time after--it was THE day, the three children went down to the station at the proper time. And everything that happened was so odd that it seemed like a dream. The Station Master came out to meet them--in his best clothes, as Peter noticed at once--and led them into the waiting room where once they had played the advertisement game. It looked quite different now. A carpet had been put down--and there were pots of roses on the mantelpiece and on the window ledges--green branches stuck up, like holly and laurel are at Christmas, over the framed advertisement of Cook’s Tours and the Beauties of Devon and the Paris Lyons Railway. There were quite a number of people there besides the Porter--two or three ladies in smart dresses, and quite a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and frock coats--besides everybody who belonged to the station. They recognized several people who had been in the train on the red-flannel-petticoat day. Best of all their own old gentleman was there, and his coat and hat and collar seemed more than ever different from anyone else’s. He shook hands with them and then everybody sat down on chairs, and a gentleman in spectacles--they found out afterwards that he was the District Superintendent--began quite a long speech--very clever indeed. I am not going to write the speech down. First, because you would think it dull; and secondly, because it made all the children blush so, and get so hot about the ears that I am quite anxious to get away from this part of the subject; and thirdly, because the gentleman took so many words to say what he had to say that I really haven’t time to write them down. He said all sorts of nice things about the children’s bravery and presence of mind, and when he had done he sat down, and everyone who was there clapped and said, “Hear, hear.”",last seem long time day child go station proper time happen odd seem dream come meet good clothes notice lead waiting room play advertisement game look different carpet put be pot rose mantelpiece window ledge green branch stick holly laurel frame advertisement be number person lady smart dress crowd gentleman high hat frock coat belong station recognize several person train red flannel petticoat day good own old gentleman coat hat collar seem more different else shake hand sit chair gentleman spectacle find begin long speech clever go write speech think dull make child blush get hot ear anxious get part subject gentleman take many word say have say have time write say sort nice thing child bravery presence mind do sit clapp say hear hear 
51,"And then the old gentleman got up and said things, too. It was very like a prize-giving. And then he called the children one by one, by their names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain. And inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watch’s new owner:--",old gentleman get say thing prize give call child name give beautiful gold watch chain watch engrave name watch new owner

57,"“Ladies and Gentlemen,” he said in a rather husky voice. Then there was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” he went on with a rush, “it’s most awfully good of you, and we shall treasure the watches all our lives--but really we don’t deserve it because what we did wasn’t anything, really. At least, I mean it was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say--thank you all very, very much.”",lady say husky voice be pause hear heart beat throat lady go rush good treasure watch life deserve do least mean exciting mean say thank

There was no time to change--and the wind happening to blow from the coal yard, her frock was soon powdered with grey, which stuck to the sticky lemonade stains and made her look, as Peter said, “like any little gutter child.”",wash hand face brush hair look tidy know unlucky upset jug lemonade front dress be time change wind happen blow coal yard frock powder grey stick sticky lemonade stain make look say little gutter child

For the Russian sprang up with a cry that made Bobbie’s heart leap and then tremble--a cry of love and longing such as she had never heard.
