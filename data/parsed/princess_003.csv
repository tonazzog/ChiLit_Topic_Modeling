1,CHAPTER III. THE PRINCESS AND--WE SHALL SEE WHO,princess see 
2," WHEN she came to the top, she found herself in a little square place, with three doors, two opposite each other, and one opposite the top of the stair. She stood for a moment, without an idea in her little head what to do next. But as she stood, she began to hear a curious humming sound. Could it be the rain? No. It was much more gentle, and even monotonous than the sound of the rain, which now she scarcely heard. The low sweet humming sound went on, sometimes stopping for a little while and then beginning again. It was more like the hum of a very happy bee that had found a rich well of honey in some globular flower, than anything else I can think of at this moment. Where could it come from? She laid her ear first to one of the doors to hearken if it was there--then to another. When she laid her ear against the third door, there could be no doubt where it came from: it must be from something in that room. What could it be? She was rather afraid, but her curiosity was stronger than her fear, and she opened the door very gently and peeped in. What do you think she saw? A very old lady who sat spinning.",come top find little square place door other top stair stand moment idea little head do stand begin hear curious hum sound rain gentle monotonous sound rain hear low sweet hum sound go stop little while begin hum happy bee find rich well honey globular flower else think moment come lay ear door hearken lay ear third door be doubt come room afraid curiosity strong fear open door peep think see old lady sit spinn 
3,"""_Oh, Mr. Editor! I know the story you are going to tell: it's The Sleeping Beauty; only you're spinning too, and making it longer._""",know story go tell spinn make 
4,"""_No, indeed, it is not that story. Why should I tell one that every properly educated child knows already? More old ladies than one have sat spinning in a garret. Besides, the old lady in that story was only spinning with a spindle, and this one was spinning with a spinning wheel, else how could the princess have heard the sweet noise through the door? Do you know the difference? Did you ever see a spindle or a spinning wheel? I daresay you never did. Well, ask your mamma to explain to you the difference. Between ourselves, however, I shouldn't wonder if she didn't know much better than you. Another thing is, that this is not a fairy story; but a goblin story. And one thing more, this old lady spinning was not an old nurse--but--you shall see who. I think I have now made it quite plain that this is not that lovely story of The Sleeping Beauty. It is quite a new one, I assure you, and I will try to tell it as prettily as I can._""",story tell educate child know old lady sit spinn garret old lady story spinn spindle one spinn spinning wheel else princess hear sweet noise door know difference see spindle spinning wheel ask mamma explain difference wonder know good thing fairy story goblin story thing more old lady spinn old nurse see think make plain lovely story new one assure try tell 
5,"Perhaps you will wonder how the princess could tell that the old lady was an old lady, when I inform you that not only was she beautiful, but her skin was smooth and white. I will tell you more. Her hair was combed back from her forehead and face, and hung loose far down and all over her back. That is not much like an old lady--is it? Ah! but it was white almost as snow. And although her face was so smooth, her eyes looked so wise that you could not have helped seeing she must be old. The princess, though she could not have told you why, did think her very old indeed--quite fifty--she said to herself. But she was rather older than that, as you shall hear.",wonder princess tell old lady old lady inform beautiful skin smooth white tell more hair comb forehead face hang back much old lady white snow face smooth eye look wise help see old princess tell think old say old hear 
6,"While the princess stared bewildered, with her head just inside the door, the old lady lifted hers, and said in a sweet, but old and rather shaky voice, which mingled very pleasantly with the continued hum of her wheel:",princess stare bewilder head door old lady lift say sweet old shaky voice mingle continue hum wheel 
7,"""Come in, my dear; come in. I am glad to see you.""",come dear come glad see 
8,"That the princess was a real princess, you might see now quite plainly; for she didn't hang on to the handle of the door, and stare without moving, as I have known some do who ought to have been princesses, but were only rather vulgar little girls. She did as she was told, stepped inside the door at once, and shut it gently behind her.",princess real princess see hang handle door stare move know do princess vulgar little girl tell step door shut 
9,"""Come to me, my dear,"" said the old lady.",come dear say old lady 
10,"And again the princess did as she was told. She approached the old lady--rather slowly, I confess, but did not stop until she stood by her side, and looked up in her face with her blue eyes and the two melted stars in them.",princess tell approach old lady confess stop stand side look face blue eye melt star

21,"""There's a good child!"" said the old lady.",be good child say old lady 
22,"Then she stopped her wheel, and rose, and, going out of the room, returned with a little silver basin and a soft white towel, with which she washed and wiped the bright little face. And the princess thought her hands were so smooth and nice!",stop wheel rise go room return little silver basin soft white towel wash wipe bright little face princess think hand smooth nice 
23,"When she carried away the basin and towel, the little princess wondered to see how straight and tall she was, for, although she was so old, she didn't stoop a bit. She was dressed in black velvet with thick white heavy-looking lace about it; and on the black dress her hair shone like silver. There was hardly any more furniture in the room than there might have been in that of the poorest old woman who made her bread by her spinning. There was no carpet on the floor--no table anywhere--nothing but the spinning-wheel and the chair beside it. When she came back, she sat down again, and without a word began her spinning once more, while Irene, who had never seen a spinning-wheel, stood by her side and looked on. When the old lady had succeeded in getting her thread fairly in operation again, she said to the princess, but without looking at her:",carry basin towel little princess wonder see straight tall old stake bit dress black velvet thick white heavy look lace black dress hair shine silver be more furniture room poor old woman make bread spinning be carpet floor table spinning wheel chair come sit word begin spinning more see spinning wheel stand side look old lady succeed get thread operation say princess look

76,"Again she stopped her spinning. She rose, took the princess by the hand, led her out of the room, and opened the door opposite the stair. The princess expected to see a lot of hens and chickens, but instead of that, she saw the blue sky first, and then the roofs of the house, with a multitude of the loveliest pigeons, mostly white, but of all colors, walking about, making bows to each other, and talking a language she could not understand. She clapped her hands with delight, and up rose such a flapping of wings, that she in her turn was startled.",stop spinning rise take princess hand lead room open door stair princess expect see lot hen chicken see blue sky roof house multitude loveliest pigeon white color walk make bow other talk language understand clapp hand delight rise flap wing turn startle

85,"The lady took hold of a little loop of string in the wall at the side of the door, and lifting a shutter showed a great many pigeon-holes with nests, some with young ones and some with eggs in them. The birds came in at the other side, and she took out the eggs on this side. She closed it again quickly, lest the young ones should be frightened.",lady take hold little loop string wall side door lift shutter show great many pigeon hole nest young one egg bird come other side take egg side close young one frighten

92,"The little princess put her hand in the old lady's, who, looking this way and that, brought her to the top of the first stair, and thence to the bottom of the second, and did not leave her till she saw her half way down the third. When she heard the cry of her nurse's pleasure at finding her, she turned and walked up the stairs again, very fast indeed for such a very great grandmother, and sat down to her spinning with another strange smile on her sweet old face.",little princess put hand old lady look way bring top first stair thence bottom second leave see half way third hear cry nurse pleasure find turn walk stair great grandmother sit spinning strange smile sweet old face
