1,CHAPTER V. CARTE BLANCHE,
2," When Ventimore woke next morning his headache had gone, and with it the recollection of everything but the wondrous and delightful fact that Sylvia loved him and had promised to be his some day. Her mother, too, was on his side; why should he despair of anything after that? There was the Professor, to be sure--but even he might be brought to consent to an engagement, especially if it turned out that the brass bottle ... and here Horace began to recall an extraordinary dream in connection with that extremely speculative purchase of his. He had dreamed that he had forced the bottle open, and that it proved to contain, not manuscripts, but an elderly Jinnee who alleged that he had been imprisoned there by the order of King Solomon!",wake next morning headache go recollection wondrous delightful fact love promise day mother side despair be sure bring consent engagement turn brass bottle begin recall extraordinary dream connection speculative purchase dream force bottle open prove contain manuscript elderly allege imprison order 
3,"What, he wondered, could have put so grotesque a fancy into his head? and then he smiled as he traced it to Sylvia's playful suggestion that the bottle might contain a ""genie,"" as did the famous jar in the ""Arabian Nights,"" and to her father's pedantic correction of the word to ""Jinnee."" Upon that slight foundation his sleeping brain had built up all that elaborate fabric--a scene so vivid and a story so circumstantial and plausible that, in spite of its extravagance, he could hardly even now persuade himself that it was entirely imaginary. The psychology of dreams is a subject which has a fascinating mystery, even for the least serious student.",wonder put grotesque fancy head smile trace playful suggestion bottle contain genie do famous jar arabian father pedantic correction word slight foundation sleeping brain build elaborate fabric scene vivid story circumstantial plausible spite extravagance persuade imaginary psychology dream subject have fascinating mystery least serious student 
4,"As he entered the sitting-room, where his breakfast awaited him, he looked round, half expecting to find the bottle lying with its lid off in the corner, as he had last seen it in his dream.",enter sitting room breakfast await look half expect find bottle lie lid corner see dream 
5,"Of course, it was not there, and he felt an odd relief. The auction-room people had not delivered it yet, and so much the better, for he had still to ascertain if it had anything inside it; and who knew that it might not contain something more to his advantage than a maundering old Jinnee with a grievance several thousands of years old?",course feel odd relief auction room person deliver much good have ascertain have know contain more advantage maunder old grievance several thousand year old 
6,"Breakfast over, he rang for his landlady, who presently appeared. Mrs. Rapkin was a superior type of her much-abused class. She was scrupulously clean and neat in her person; her sandy hair was so smooth and tightly knotted that it gave her head the colour and shape of a Barcelona nut; she had sharp, beady eyes, nostrils that seemed to smell battle afar off, a wide, thin mouth that apparently closed with a snap, and a dry, whity-brown complexion suggestive of bran.",breakfast ring landlady appear superior type abuse class clean neat person sandy hair smooth knotted give head colour shape nut have sharp beady eye nostril seem smell battle wide thin mouth close snap dry whity brown complexion suggestive bran 
7,"But if somewhat grim of aspect, she was a good soul and devoted to Horace, in whom she took almost a maternal interest, while regretting that he was not what she called ""serious-minded enough"" to get on in the world. Rapkin had wooed and married her when they were both in service, and he still took occasional jobs as an outdoor butler, though Horace suspected that his more staple form of industry was the consumption of gin-and-water and remarkably full-flavoured cigars in the basement parlour.",grim aspect good soul devote take maternal interest regret call serious minded get world wooe marry service take occasional job outdoor butler suspect staple form industry consumption gin water full flavoure cigar basement parlour 
8,"""Shall you be dining in this evening, sir?"" inquired Mrs. Rapkin.",dine evening sir inquire 
9,"""I don't know. Don't get anything in for me; I shall most probably dine at the club,"" said Horace; and Mrs. Rapkin, who had a confirmed belief that all clubs were hotbeds of vice and extravagance, sniffed disapproval. ""By the way,"" he added, ""if a kind of brass pot is sent here, it's all right. I bought it at a sale yesterday. Be careful how you handle it--it's rather old.""",know get dine club say have confirm belief club hotbed vice extravagance sniff disapproval way add kind brass pot send right buy sale yesterday careful handle old

12,"Mrs. Rapkin retired, to reappear presently with the brass bottle. ""I thought you'd have noticed it when you come in last night, sir,"" she explained, ""for I stood it in the corner, and when I see it this morning it was layin' o' one side and looking that dirty and disrespectable I took it down to give it a good clean, which it wanted it.""",retire reappear brass bottle think notice come last night sir explain stand corner see morning layin o' side look dirty disrespectable take give good clean want

14,"""I hope I've done nothing wrong,"" said Mrs. Rapkin, observing his expression; ""I only used a little warm ale to it, which is a capital thing for brass-work, and gave it a scrub with 'Vitrolia' soap--but it would take more than that to get all the muck off of it.""",hope do wrong say observe expression use little warm ale capital thing brass work give scrub soap take more get muck

17,"Horace started. Then _that_ part was true, too! ""Oh, ah,"" he said, ""I believe I did. I'd forgotten. That reminds me.

Why, there was Rapkin's own sister-in-law let her parlour floor to a Horiental--a Parsee _he_ was, or _one_ o' them Hafrican tribes--and reason she 'ad to repent of it, for all his gold spectacles!

21,"As soon as she relieved him of her presence, he examined the bottle: there was nothing whatever inside it, which disposed of all the hopes he had entertained from that quarter.",relieve presence examine bottle be dispose hope entertain quarter 
22,It was not difficult to account for the visionary Oriental as an hallucination probably inspired by the heavy fumes (for he now believed in the fumes) which had doubtless resulted from the rapid decomposition of some long-buried spices or similar substances suddenly exposed to the air.,difficult account visionary hallucination inspire heavy fume believe fume result rapid decomposition long bury spice similar substance expose air 
23,"If any further explanation were needed, the accidental blow to the back of his head, together with the latent suggestion from the ""Arabian Nights,"" would amply provide it.",further explanation need accidental blow back head latent suggestion arabian provide 
24,"So, having settled these points to his entire satisfaction, he went to his office in Great Cloister Street, which he now had entirely to himself, and was soon engaged in drafting the specification for Beevor on which he had been working when so fortunately interrupted the day before by the Professor.",settle point entire satisfaction go office great have engage draft specification work interrupt day 
25,"The work was more or less mechanical, and could bring him no credit and little thanks, but Horace had the happy faculty of doing thoroughly whatever he undertook, and as he sat there by his wide-open window he soon became entirely oblivious of all but the task before him.",work more mechanical bring credit little thanks have happy faculty do undertake sit wide open window become oblivious task 
26,"So much so that, even when the light became obscured for a moment, as if by some large and opaque body in passing, he did not look up immediately, and, when he did, was surprised to find the only armchair occupied by a portly person, who seemed to be trying to recover his breath.",much light become obscure moment large opaque body passing look surprise find only armchair occupy portly person seem try recover breath

28,"His visitor could only wave his head in courteous deprecation, under which there seemed a suspicion of bewildered embarrassment. He was a rosy-gilled, spotlessly clean, elderly gentleman, with white whiskers; his eyes, just then slightly protuberant, were shrewd, but genial; he had a wide, jolly mouth and a double chin. He was dressed like a man who is above disguising his prosperity; he wore a large, pear-shaped pearl in his crimson scarf, and had probably only lately discarded his summer white hat and white waistcoat.",visitor wave head courteous deprecation seem suspicion bewilder embarrassment rosy gilled clean elderly gentleman white whisker eye protuberant shrewd genial have wide jolly mouth double chin dress man disguise prosperity wear large pear shape pearl crimson scarf discard summer white hat white waistcoat

Horace, of course, concealed the fact that his visitor's name and fame were unfamiliar to him. ""I've lately bought a few acres on the Hampshire border, near the house I'm living in just now; and I've been thinking--as I was saying to a friend only just now, as we were crossing Westminster Bridge--I've been thinking of building myself a little place there, just a humble, unpretentious home, where I could run down for the weekend and entertain a friend or two in a quiet way, and perhaps live some part of the year. Hitherto I've rented places as I wanted 'em--old family seats and ancestral mansions and so forth: very nice in their way, but I want to feel under a roof of my own. I want to surround myself with the simple comforts, the--ah--unassuming elegance of an English country home.

45,"Here was the long-wished-for client at last!

Why not come down by the 8.45 a.m. to Lipsfield? I'll have a trap, or a brougham and pair, or something, waiting for you--take you over the ground myself, bring you back to lunch with us at Oriel Court, and talk the whole thing thoroughly over.

52,"With this Mr. Wackerbath departed, leaving Horace, as may be imagined, absolutely overwhelmed by the suddenness and completeness of his good fortune. He was no longer one of the unemployed: he had work to do, and, better still, work that would interest him, give him all the scope and opportunity he could wish for. With a client who seemed tractable, and to whom money was clearly no object, he might carry out some of his most ambitious ideas.",depart leave imagine overwhelm suddenness completeness good fortune unemployed have work do work interest give scope opportunity wish client seem tractable money object carry ambitious idea 
53,"Moreover, he would now be in a position to speak to Sylvia's father without fear of a repulse. His commission on £60,000 would be £3,000, and that on the decorations and other work at least as much again--probably more. In a year he could marry without imprudence; in two or three years he might be making a handsome income, for he felt confident that, with such a start, he would soon have as much work as he could undertake.",position speak father fear repulse commission decoration other work least much more year marry imprudence year make handsome income feel confident start have much work undertake

56,"It was still early, and he walked the whole way, as some vent for his high spirits, enjoying everything with a new zest--the dappled grey and salmon sky before him, the amber, russet, and yellow of the scanty foliage in Kensington Gardens, the pungent scent of fallen chestnuts and acorns and burning leaves, the blue-grey mist stealing between the distant tree-trunks, and then the cheery bustle and brilliancy of the High Street. Finally came the joy of finding Sylvia all alone, and witnessing her frank delight at what he had come to tell her, of feeling her hands on his shoulders, and holding her in his arms, as their lips met for the first time. If on that Saturday afternoon there was a happier man than Horace Ventimore, he would have done well to dissemble his felicity, for fear of incurring the jealousy of the high gods.",early walk whole way vent high spirit enjoy new zest dappled grey salmon sky amber russet yellow scanty foliage pungent scent fall chestnut acorn burning leave blue grey mist steal distant tree trunk cheery bustle brilliancy high come joy find witness frank delight come tell feel hand shoulder hold arm lip meet first time afternoon be happy man do dissemble felicity fear incurr jealousy high god
