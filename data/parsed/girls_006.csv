2,"Between forty and fifty young girls assembled night and morning for prayers in the pretty chapel which adjoined Lavender House.  This chapel had been reconstructed from the ruins of an ancient priory, on the site of which the house was built.  The walls, and even the beautiful eastern window, belonged to a far-off date.  The roof had been carefully reared in accordance with the style of the east window, and the whole effect was beautiful and impressive.  Mrs Willis was particularly fond of her own chapel.  Here she hoped the girls' best lessons might be learned, and here she had even once or twice brought a refractory pupil, and tried what a gentle word or two spoken in these old and sacred walls might effect.  Here, on wet Sundays the girls assembled for service; and here, every evening at nine o'clock, came the vicar of the large parish to which Lavender House belonged, to conduct evening prayers.  He was an old man, and a great friend of Mrs Willis's, and he often told her that he considered these young girls some of the most important members of his flock.",young girl assemble night morning prayer pretty chapel adjoin chapel reconstruct ruin ancient priory site house build wall beautiful eastern window belong date roof rear accordance style east window whole effect beautiful impressive fond own chapel hope girl good lesson learn have bring refractory pupil try gentle word speak old sacred wall effect wet sunday girl assemble service evening o'clock come vicar large parish belong conduct evening prayer old man great friend tell consider young girl important member flock 
3,"Here Hester knelt to-night.  It is to be doubted whether in her confusion, and in the strange loneliness which even Mrs Willis had scarcely removed, she prayed much.  It is certain she did not join in the evening hymn, which, with the aid of an organ and some sweet girl-voices, was beautifully and almost pathetically rendered.  After evening prayers had come to an end, Mrs Willis took Hester's hand and led her up to the old, white-headed vicar.",knolt night doubt confusion strange loneliness remove pray much certain join evening hymn aid organ sweet girl voice render evening prayer come end take hand lead old white head vicar

10,"But Hester's face had grown white.  The solemn service in the chapel, joined to all the excitement and anxieties of the day, had strung up her sensitive nerves to a pitch higher than she could endure.  Suddenly, as the vicar spoke to her, and Mrs Willis looked kindly down at her new pupil, the chapel seemed to reel round, the pupils one by one disappeared, and the tired girl only saved herself from fainting by a sudden burst of tears.",face grow white solemn service chapel join excitement anxiety day string sensitive nerve pitch high endure vicar speak look new pupil chapel seem reel pupil disappear tired girl save fainting sudden burst tear

14,"""Now, love, you shall have some hot gruel.  No, not a word.  You ate little or no tea, to-night--I watched you from my distant table.  Half your loneliness is caused by want of food--I know it, my love; I am a very practical person.  Now, eat your gruel, and then shut your eyes and go to sleep.""",love have hot gruel word eat little tea night watch distant table loneliness cause want food know love practical person eat gruel shut eye go sleep
