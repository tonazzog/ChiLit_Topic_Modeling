5,"Margaret still lay on the sofa, and her complexion had assumed the dead white of habitual ill-health. There was more languor of manner, and her countenance, when at rest, and not under the eye of her father, had a sadness of expression, as if any hopes that she might once have entertained were fading away. The years of Alan Ernescliffe’s absence that had elapsed had rather taken from her powers than added to them. Nevertheless, the habit of cheerfulness and sympathy had not deserted her, and it was with a somewhat amused glance that she turned towards Ethel, as she heard her answer by a sigh.",lay sofa complexion assume dead white habitual ill health be more languor manner countenance rest eye father have sadness expression hope entertain fade year absence elapse take power add habit cheerfulness sympathy desert amused glance turn hear answer sigh 
6,"These years had dealt more kindly with Etheldred’s outward appearance. They had rounded her angles, softened her features, and tinged her cheeks with a touch of red, that took off from the surrounding sallowness. She held herself better, had learned to keep her hair in order, and the more womanly dress, plain though it was, improved her figure more than could have been hoped in the days of her lank, gawky girlhood. No one could call her pretty, but her countenance had something more than ever pleasing in the animated and thoughtful expression on those marked features. She was sitting near the window, with a book, a dictionary, and pencil, as she replied to Margaret, with the sigh that made her sister smile.",year deal outward appearance round angle soften feature ting cheek touch red take surround sallowness hold good learn keep hair order womanly dress plain improve figure more hope day lank gawky girlhood call countenance have more pleasing animated thoughtful expression mark feature sit window book dictionary pencil reply sigh make sister smile

14,"“So,” said Ethel, disregarding, “she stirs up all Stoneborough to hear what the Miss Mays are doing at Cocksmoor. So the Ladies’ Committee must needs have their finger in! Much they cared for the place when it was wild and neglected! But they go to inspect Cherry and her school--Mrs. Ledwich and all--and, back they come, shocked--no system, no order, the mistress untrained, the school too small, with no apparatus! They all run about in despair, as if we had ever asked them to help us. And so Mrs. Hoxton, who cares for poor children no more than for puppy-dogs, but who can’t live without useless work, and has filled her house as full of it as it can hold, devises a bazaar--a field for her trumpery, and a show-off for all the young ladies; and Flora treats it like an inspiration! Off they trot, to the old Assembly Rooms. I trusted that the smallness of them would have knocked it on the head; but, still worse, Flora’s talking of it makes Mr. Rivers think it our pet scheme; so, what does he do but offer his park, and so we are to have a regular fancy fair, and Cocksmoor School will be founded in vanity and frivolity! But I believe you like it!”",say disregard stir hear do need have finger much care place wild neglect go inspect school come shocked system order mistress untrained school small apparatus run despair ask help care poor child more puppy dog live useless work fill house full hold devise bazaar field trumpery show off young lady treat inspiration trot old trust smallness knock head bad talk make think pet scheme do offer park have regular fancy fair found vanity frivolity believe like

16,"“No,” said Ethel. “He will only laugh, and say it will spare him a great many of Mrs. Hoxton’s nervous attacks.

Would Mrs. Hoxton spend the time in making frocks for Cocksmoor children that she does in cutting out paper, and stuffing glass bottles with it?

32,"“Margaret--we see much evil arise in the best-planned institutions; nay, in what are not human. Don’t you think we ought to do our utmost to have no flaw in the foundation? Schools are not such perfect places that we can build them without fear, and, if the means are to be raised by a bargain for amusement--if they are to come from frivolity instead of self-denial, I am afraid of them.

35,"“Now, Ethel!”",

38,"“If it was only that, I should not care, but I may as well tell you, Margaret, for it is a weight to me. It is not the mere pleasure in gaieties--Flora cares for them, in themselves, as little as I do--nor is it neighbourliness, as a duty to others, for, you may observe, she always gets off any engagement to the Wards, or any of the town folk, to whom it would be a gratification to have her--she either eludes them, or sends me. The thing is, that she is always trying to be with the great people, the county set, and I don’t think that is the safe way of going on.”",care tell weight mere pleasure gaiety care little do neighbourliness duty other observe get engagement town folk gratification have elude send thing try great person county set think safe way go

You know Mr. Rivers is always ill in London: indeed, papa says it would be the death of him; but Lady Leonora Langdale thinks it dreadful that Meta should not go to all the gaieties; and last year, when Mrs. Larpent was gone, she insisted on her coming to stay with her for the season.

They little knew Meta, with her pretty ways of pretending that her resolution is only spoiled-child wilfulness. None of you quite trusted her, did you, Margaret?

I believe it was very charming, and she would have been very glad to stay, but she never would promise, and she was always thinking of her positive duty at home. She seemed afterwards to think of her wishes to remain almost as if they had been a sin; but she said--dear little Meta--that nothing had ever helped her so much as that she used to say to herself, whenever she was going out, ‘I renounce the world.’ It came to a crisis at last, when Lady Leonora wanted her to be presented--the Drawing-Room was after the end of her three weeks--and she held out against it; though her aunt laughed at her, and treated her as if she was a silly, shy child. At last, what do you think Meta did? She went to her uncle, Lord Cosham, and appealed to him to say whether there was the least necessity for her to go to court.”",do utmost say make engagement take party concert enjoy have lesson draw music want see exhibition do say be time spare believe charming glad stay promise think positive duty home seem think wish remain sin say dear little help use say go renounce world come crisis last want present room end week hold aunt laugh treat silly shy child last think go uncle appeal say be least necessity go court

He told papa so himself--for you must know, when he heard all Meta had to say, he called her a very good girl, and said he would take her home himself on the Saturday she had fixed, and spend Sunday at Abbotstoke. Oh! he was perfectly won by her sweet ways. Was not it lucky? for before this Lady Leonora had written to Mr. Rivers, and obtained from him a letter, which Meta had the next day, desiring her to stay for the Drawing-Room. But Meta knew well enough how it was, and was not to be conquered that way; so she said she must go home to entertain her uncle, and that if her papa really wished it, she would return on Monday.”",delight spirit coax way admire determination tell papa know hear have say call good girl say take home fix spend win sweet way lucky write obtain letter have next day desire stay know conquer way say go entertain uncle papa wish return

How she danced in, and how she sparkled with glee!” said Margaret, “and poor Mr. Rivers was quite tremulous with the joy of having her back, hardly able to keep from fondling her every minute, and coming again into the room after they had taken leave, to tell me that his little girl had preferred her home, and her poor old father, to all the pleasures in London. Oh, I was so glad they came! That was a sight that did one good!

But as soon as she entered into the true spirit of our calling, did she not begin to seek to live the sterner life, and train herself in duty?

104,"For herself, Ethel had drawn up a beautiful time-table, with all her pursuits and duties most carefully balanced, after the pattern of that which Margaret Rivers had made by her advice, on the departure of Mrs. Larpent, who had been called away by the ill-health of her son. Meta had adhered to hers in an exemplary manner, but she was her own mistress in a manner that could hardly be the lot of one of a large family.",draw beautiful time table pursuit duty balance pattern make advice departure call ill health son adhere exemplary manner own mistress manner lot large family 
105,"Margaret had become subject to languor and palpitations, and the head of the household had fallen entirely upon Flora, who, on the other hand, was a person of multifarious occupations, and always had a great number of letters to write, or songs to copy and practise, which, together with her frequent visits to Mrs. Hoxton, made her glad to devolve, as much as she could, upon her younger sister; and, “Oh, Ethel, you will not mind just doing this for me,” was said often enough to be a tax upon her time.",become subject languor palpitation head household fall other hand person multifarious occupation have great number letter write song copy practise frequent visit make glad devolve young sister mind do say tax time 
106,"Moreover, Ethel perceived that Aubrey’s lessons were in an unsatisfactory state. Margaret could not always attend to them, and suffered from them when she did; and he was bandied about between his sisters and Miss Bracy in a manner that made him neither attentive nor obedient.",perceive lesson unsatisfactory state attend suffer band sister manner make attentive obedient 
107,"On her own principle, that to embrace a task heartily renders it no longer irksome, she called on herself to sacrifice her studies and her regularity, as far as was needful, to make her available for home requirements. She made herself responsible for Aubrey, and, after a few battles with his desultory habits, made him a very promising pupil, inspiring so much of herself into him, that he was, if anything, overfull of her classical tastes. In fact, he had such an appetite for books, and dealt so much in precocious wisdom, that his father was heard to say, “Six years old! It is a comfort that he will soon forget the whole.”",own principle embrace task render irksome call sacrifice study regularity needful make available home requirement make responsible few battle desultory habit make promising pupil inspire much overfull classical taste fact have appetite book deal much precocious wisdom father hear say year old comfort forget whole 
108,"Gertrude was also Ethel’s pupil, but learning was not at all in her line; and the sight of “Cobwebs to catch Flies,” or of the venerated “Little Charles,” were the most serious clouds, that made the Daisy pucker up her face, and infuse a whine into her voice.",pupil learn line sight cobweb catch venerate little serious cloud make pucker face infuse whine voice 
109,"However, to-day, as usual, she was half dragged, half coaxed, through her day’s portion of the discipline of life, and then sent up for her sleep, while Aubrey’s two hours were spent in more agreeable work, such as Margaret could not but enjoy hearing--so spirited was Ethel’s mode of teaching--so eager was her scholar.",day usual half drag half coax day portion discipline life send sleep hour spend agreeable work such enjoy hearing spirit mode teaching eager scholar 
110,"His play afterwards consisted in fighting o’er again the siege of Troy on the floor, with wooden bricks, shells, and the survivors of a Noah’s ark, while Ethel read to Margaret until Gertrude’s descent from the nursery, when the only means of preventing a dire confusion in Aubrey’s camp was for her elder sisters to become her playfellows, and so spare Aubrey’s temper. Ethel good-humouredly gave her own time, till their little tyrant trotted out to make Norman carry her round the garden on his back.",play consist fight siege floor wooden brick shell survivor ark read descent nursery only means prevent dire confusion camp elder sister become playfellow spare temper good give own time little tyrant trotet make carry garden back 
111,"So sped the morning till Flora came home, full of the intended bazaar, and Ethel would fain have taken refuge in puzzling out her Spanish, had she not remembered her recent promise to be gracious.",spe morning come full intend bazaar take refuge puzzle remember recent promise gracious 
112,"The matter had been much as she had described it. Flora had a way of hinting at anything she thought creditable, and thus the Stoneborough public had become aware of the exertions of the May family on behalf of Cocksmoor.",matter much describe have way hint think creditable public become aware exertion family behalf 
113,"The plan of a fancy fair was started. Mrs. Hoxton became more interested than was her wont, and Flora was enchanted at the opening it gave for promoting the welfare of the forlorn district. She held a position which made her hope to direct the whole. As she had once declared, with truth, it only had depended on themselves, whether she and her sisters should sink to the level of the Andersons and their set, or belong to the county society; and her tact had resulted in her being decidedly--as the little dressmaker’s apprentice amused Ethel by saying--“One of our most distinguished patronesses”--a name that had stuck by her ever since.",plan fancy fair start become interested wont enchant opening give promote welfare forlorn district hold position make hope direct whole declare truth depend sister sink level set belong county society tact result little dressmaker apprentice amuse say distinguished patroness name stick 
114,"Margaret looked on passively, inclined to admire Flora in everything, yet now and then puzzled; and her father, in his simple-hearted way, felt only gratitude and exultation in the kindness that his daughter met with. As to the bazaar, if it had been started in his own family, he might have weighed the objections, but, as it was not his daughter’s own concern, he did not trouble himself about it, only regarding it as one of the many vagaries of the ladies of Stoneborough.",look inclined admire puzzle father simple hearted way feel gratitude exultation kindness daughter meet bazaar start own family weigh objection daughter own concern trouble regard many vagary lady 
115,"So the scheme had been further developed, till now Flora came in with much to tell. The number of stalls had been finally fixed. Mrs. Hoxton undertook one, with Flora as an aide-de-camp, and some nieces to assist; Lady Leonora was to chaperon Miss Rivers; and a third, to Flora’s regret, had been allotted to Miss Cleveland, a good-natured, merry, elderly heiress, who would, Flora feared, bring on them the whole “Stoneborough crew.” And then she began to reckon up the present resources--drawings, bags, and pincushions. “That chip hat you plaited for Daisy, Margaret, you must let us have that. It will be lovely, trimmed with pink.”",scheme develop come much tell number stall fix undertake aide camp niece assist chaperon third regret allot good natured merry elderly heiress fear bring whole crew begin reckon present resource drawing bag pincushion chip hat plait let have lovely trim pink 
116,"“Do you wish for this?” said Ethel, heaving up a mass of knitting.",wish say heave mass knitting 
117,"“Thank you,” said Flora; “so ornamental, especially the original performance in the corner, which you would perpetrate, in spite of my best efforts.”",thank say ornamental original performance corner perpetrate spite good effort

120,“No; you shall tell me what I am to do.”,tell do 
121,"“Does she mean it?” said Flora, turning to Margaret. “Have you converted her? Well done! Then, Ethel, we will get some pretty batiste, and you and Mary shall make some of those nice sun-bonnets, which you really do to perfection.”",mean say turn convert do get pretty batiste make nice sun-bonnet do perfection 
122,"“Thank you. That is a more respectable task than I expected. People may have something worth buying,” said Ethel, who, like all the world, felt the influence of Flora’s tact.",thank respectable task expect person have worth buy say world feel influence tact 
123,"“I mean to study the useful,” said Flora. “The Cleveland set will be sure to deal in frippery, and I have been looking over Mrs. Hoxton’s stores, where I see quite enough for mere decoration. There are two splendid vases in potichomanie, in an Etruscan pattern, which are coming for me to finish.”",mean study useful say set sure deal frippery look store see enough mere decoration be splendid vase potichomanie etruscan pattern come finish 
124,"“Mrs. Taylor, at Cocksmoor, could do that for you,” said Ethel. “Her two phials, stuffed with chintz patterns and flour, are quite as original and tasteful.”",do say phial stuff chintz pattern flour original tasteful 
125,"“Silly work,” said Flora, “but it makes a fair show.”",silly work say make fair show 
126,"“The essence of Vanity Fair,” said Ethel.",essence say

128,“I don’t want to get on.”,want get 
129,"“But you want--or, at least, I want--Cocksmoor to get on.”",want least want get 
130,"Ethel saw Margaret looking distressed, and, recalling her resolution she said, “Well, Flora, I don’t mean to say any more about it. I see it can’t be helped, and you all think you intend it for good; so there’s an end of the matter, and I’ll do anything for you in reason.”",see look distress recall resolution say mean say more see help think intend good be end matter do reason 
131,"“Poor old King Ethel!” said Flora, smiling in an elder-sisterly manner. “You will see, my dear, your views are very pretty, but very impracticable, and it is a work-a-day world after all--even papa would tell you so. When Cocksmoor school is built, then you may thank me. I do not look for it before.”",poor old say smile elder sisterly manner see dear view pretty impracticable work day world papa tell school build thank look
