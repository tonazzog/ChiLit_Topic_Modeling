1,CHAPTER 26. AT COVENTRY.,
2,"Were you ever at Coventry, reader?  I don't mean the quaint old Warwickshire city, but that other place where from morning till night you are shunned and avoided by everybody?  Where friends with whom you were once on the most intimate terms now pass you without a word, or look another way as you go by?  Where, whichever way you go, you find yourself alone?  Where every one you speak to is deaf, every one you appear before is blind, every one you go near has business somewhere else?  Where you will be left undisturbed in your study for a week, to fag for yourself, study by yourself, disport yourself with yourself? Where in the playground you will be as solitary as if you were in the desert, in school you will be a class by yourself, and even in church on Sundays you will feel hopelessly out in the cold among your fellow-worshippers?",reader mean quaint old city other place morning night shunn avoid friend intimate term pass word look way go way go find alone one speak deaf one appear blind one go have business else leave undisturbed study week fig study disport playground solitary desert school class church feel cold fellow worshipper 
3,"If you have ever been to such a place, you can imagine Oliver Greenfield's experiences during this Christmas term at Saint Dominic's.",place imagine experience term 
4,"When the gentlemen of the Fifth Form had once made up their minds to anything, they generally carried it through with great heartiness, and certainly they never succeeded better in any undertaking than in this of ""leaving Oliver to himself.""",gentleman fifth make mind carry great heartiness succeed good undertaking leave 
5,"The only drawback to their success was that the proceeding appeared to have little or no effect on the _very_ person on whose behalf it was undertaken.  Not that Oliver could be _quite_ insensible of the honours paid him.  He could not--they were too marked for that.  And without doubt they were as unpleasant as they were unmistakable.  But, for any sign of unhappiness he displayed, the whole affair might have been a matter of supreme indifference to him.  Indeed, it looked quite as much as if Greenfield had sent the Fifth to Coventry as the Fifth Greenfield. If they determined none of them to speak to him, he was equally determined none of them should have the chance; and if it was part of their scheme to leave him as much as possible to himself, they had little trouble in doing it, for he, except when inevitable, never came near them.",only drawback success proceeding appear have little effect _very_ person behalf undertake insensible honour pay mark doubt unpleasant unmistakable sign unhappiness display whole affair matter supreme indifference look much send fifth fifth determine speak determine have chance part scheme leave possible have little trouble do inevitable come 
6,"Of course this was dreadfully irritating to the Fifth!  The moral revenge they had promised themselves on the disgracer of their class never seemed to come off.  The wind was taken out of their sails at every turn.  The object of their aversion was certainly not reduced to humility or penitence by their conduct; on the contrary, one or two of them felt decidedly inclined to be ashamed of themselves and feel foolish when they met their victim.",course irritating fifth moral revenge promise disgracer class seem come wind take sail turn object aversion reduce humility penitence conduct contrary feel inclined ashamed feel foolish meet victim 
7,"Oliver always had been a queer fellow, and he now came out in a queerer light than ever.",queer fellow come queerer light 
8,"Having once seen how the wind lay, and what he had to expect from the Fifth, he altered the course of his life to suit the new circumstances with the greatest coolness.  Instead of going up the river in a pair-oar or a four, he now went up in a sculling boat or a canoe, and seemed to enjoy himself quite as much.  Instead of doing his work with Wraysford evening after evening, he now did it undisturbed by himself, and, to judge by his progress in class, more successfully than ever.  Instead of practising with the fifteens at football, he went in for a regular course of practice in the gymnasium, and devoted himself with remarkable success to the horizontal bar and the high jump.  Instead of casting in his lot in class with a jovial though somewhat distracting set, he now kept his mind free for his studies, and earned the frequent commendation of the Doctor and Mr Jellicott.",see wind lay have expect fifth alter course life suit new circumstance great coolness go river pair oar go scull boat canoe seem enjoy much do work evening evening do undisturbed judge progress class practise fifteen football go regular course practice gymnasium devote remarkable success horizontal bar high jump cast lot class jovial distracting set keep mind free study earn frequent commendation 
9,"Now, reader, I ask you, if you had been one of the Fifth of Saint Dominic's would not all this have been very riling?  Here was a fellow convicted of a shameful piece of deceit, caught, one might say, in the very act, and by his own conduct as good as admitting it.  Here was a fellow, I say, whom every sensible boy ought to avoid, not only showing himself utterly indifferent to the aversion of his class-fellows, but positively thriving and triumphing before their very faces!  Was it any wonder if they felt very sore, and increasingly sore on the subject of Oliver Greenfield?",reader ask fifth riling fellow convict shameful piece deceit catch say very act own conduct good admit fellow say sensible boy avoid show indifferent aversion class fellow thriving triumph very face wonder feel sore sore subject 
10,"One boy, of course, stuck to the exile through thick and thin.  If Oliver had murdered all Saint Dominic's with slow poison, Stephen would have stuck to him to the end, and he stuck to him now.  He, at least, never once admitted that his brother was guilty.  When slowly he first discovered what were the suspicions of the Fifth, and what was the common talk of the school about Oliver, the small boy's indignation was past description.  He rushed to his brother.",boy course stick exile thick thin murder slow poison stick end stick least admit brother guilty discover suspicion fifth common talk school small boy indignation past description rush brother

14,"""What's the use?  I've told them once.  If they don't choose to believe it, they needn't.""",use tell choose believe need 
15,"Any other boy would, of course, have taken this as clear evidence of the elder brother's guilt; but it only strengthened the small boy's indignation.",other boy course take clear evidence elder brother guilt strengthen small boy indignation 
16,"""_I'll_ let them know, if _you_ won't!"" and forthwith he went and proceeded to make himself a perfect nuisance in the school.  He began with Wraysford.",let know go proceed make perfect nuisance school begin 
17,"""I say, Wray,"" he demanded, ""do you hear all the lies the fellows are telling about Noll?""",say demand hear lie fellow tell 
18,"""Don't make a row now,"" said Wraysford, shortly.  ""I'm busy.""  But Stephen had no notion of being put down.",make row say busy have notion put 
19,"""The fellows say he stole an exam paper, the blackguards!  I'd like to punch all their heads, and I will too!""",fellow say steal exam paper blackguard like punch head 
20,"""Clear out of my study, now,"" said Wraysford, sharply.",clear study say 
21,Stephen stared at him a moment.  Then his face grew pale as he grasped the meaning of it all.,stare moment face grow pale grasp meaning 
22,"""I say, Wray, surely _you_ don't believe it?"" he cried.",say believe cry 
23,"""Go away now,"" was Wraysford's only answer.",go only answer 
24,"But this did not suit Stephen, his blood was up, and he meant to have it out.",suit blood mean have 
25,"""Surely _you_ don't believe it?"" he repeated, disregarding the impatience of the other; ""_you_ aren't a blackguard, like the rest?""",believe repeat disregard impatience other _you_ blackguard rest 
26,"""Do you hear what I tell you?"" said Wraysford.",hear tell say 
27,"""No, and I don't mean to!"" retorted the irate Stephen.  ""If you were anything of a friend you'd stand up for Oliver.  You're a beast, Wraysford, that's what you are!"" continued he, in a passion.  ""You're a blackguard! you're a liar!  I could kill you!""",mean retort irate friend stand beast continue passion blackguard liar kill 
28,"And the poor boy, wild with rage and misery, actually flung himself blindly upon his brother's old friend--the saviour of his own life.",poor boy wild rage misery flung brother old friend saviour own life 
29,"Wraysford was not angry.  There was more of pity in his face than anger as he took the small boy by the arm and led him to the door.  Stephen no longer resisted.  After giving vent to the first flood of his anger, misery got the upper hand of him, and he longed to go anywhere to hide it.  He could have endured to know that Oliver was suspected by a good many of the fellows, but to find Wraysford among them was a cruel blow.",angry be more pity face anger take small boy arm lead door resist give vent first flood anger misery get upper hand long go hide endure know suspect good many fellow find cruel blow 
30,"But in due time his indignation again came to the fore, and he ventured on another crusade.  This time it was to Pembury.  He knew before he went he had little enough to expect from the sharp-tongued editor of the _Dominican_, so he went hoping little.",due time indignation come fore venture crusade time know go have little expect sharp tongued editor go hope little 
31,"To his surprise, however, Pembury was kinder than usual.  He told him plainly that he did suspect Oliver, and explained why, and advised Stephen, if he were wise, to say as little about Oliver as possible at present.  The young champion was quite cowed by this unexpected reception.  He did his best to fly in a rage and be defiant, but it was no use, and he retired woefully discomfited from the interview.",surprise kind usual tell suspect explain advise wise say little possible present young champion cow unexpected reception do good fly rage defiant use retire discomfite interview 
32,"Others to whom he applied, when once again his anger got the better of his wretchedness, met him with taunts, others with contempt, others with positive unkindness; and after a week Stephen gave it up and retired in dudgeon to the territory of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, determined that there at least he would, at the edge of the knuckle, if needs be, compel a faction to declare for his brother.",other apply anger get good wretchedness meet taunt other contempt other positive unkindness week give retire dudgeon territory guinea pig determine least edge knuckle need compel faction declare brother 
33,"In this undertaking, I need hardly say, he was eminently successful. There were those among the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles who were ready to declare for anybody or anything as long as there was a chance of a row on the head of it.  Already the question of Greenfield senior had been occupying their magnificent minds.  When the story first fell suddenly into their midst, it was so surprising that, like the frogs and the log in the fable, they were inclined to be a little shy of it.  But, gradually becoming accustomed to it, and looking carefully into it from all sides, it seemed somehow to contain the promise of a jolly row, and their hearts warmed to it proportionally.  No one quite liked to start the thing at first, for fear doubtless of not doing it full justice, but it only wanted a spark to kindle the whole lower school on the question of Greenfield senior.  Stephen it was who supplied the spark.",undertaking need say successful be guinea pig tadpole ready declare be chance row head question senior occupy magnificent mind story fall midst surprising frog log fable inclined little shy become accustom look side seem contain promise jolly row heart warm like start thing fear do full justice want spark kindle whole low school question senior supply spark 
34,"He entered the Fourth Junior room one day, after one of the unsuccessful crusades of which we have spoken, utterly cast down and out of humour. He flung his cap on to the peg, and himself on to his seat, in an unusually agitated manner, and then, to the astonishment of everybody, broke out into tears!",enter fourth room day unsuccessful crusade speak cast humour flung cap peg seat agitated manner astonishment break tear 
35,"This was a rare and glorious opportunity, of course, for Bramble.",rare glorious opportunity course 
36,"""Beastly young blub-baby!"" exclaimed that doughty hero, ""you're always blubbing!  I never knew such a fellow to blub, did you, Padger?""",beastly young blub baby exclaim hero blubb know fellow blub 
37,"Padger said it was worse than the baby at home, and the two thereupon started a mocking caterwaul on their own account, in which not a few of their nearest and dearest friends joined.",say bad baby home thereupon start mocking caterwaul own account few near dearest friend join 
38,"This performance had the effect of restoring Stephen's composure. Hastily dashing away his tears, he flew with unwonted wrath at his enemy.  Bramble, however, managed to get behind Padger and the rest, and thus fortified shouted out, ""Yah, boo, howling young sucking pig! go home to your mammy, or your great big cheat of a blackguard thief of a caddish big brother!  Do you hear?  Who stole the exam paper?  Eh, Padger?  Yah, boo, pack of sneaking Guinea-pigs!""",performance have effect restore composure dash tear fly unwonted wrath enemy manage get rest fortify shout howl young sucking pig go mammy great big cheat blackguard thief caddish big brother hear steal exam paper pack sneak guinea pig 
39,"This last objurgation, which was quite unnecessary to the beauty or force of the speech, gave rise to a huge tumult.",last objurgation unnecessary beauty force speech give rise huge tumult 
40,"The Guinea-pigs present took it up as a direct challenge to themselves, and it decided them instantly to declare in favour of Stephen and his big brother.  Paul led the attack.",guinea pig present take direct challenge decide declare favour big brother lead attack 
41,"""Shut up, you young cad, will you?"" said he; ""you know well enough _you_ stole the paper.""",shut young cad say know steal paper 
42,"Of course no one, not even Paul himself, attached any meaning to such an absurd accusation, but it came conveniently to hand.",course attach meaning absurd accusation come hand 
43,"This declaration of war was promptly taken up on all sides, and for a short period the Fourth Junior had a rather dusty appearance.  When at length a little order was restored, a lively discussion on the crime of Greenfield senior ensued.  The Tadpoles to a man believed in it, and gave it as their candid opinion that the fellow ought to be hung.  ""Yes, and expelled too!"" added a few of the more truculent.",declaration war take side short period fourth have dusty appearance length little order restore lively discussion crime senior ensue man believe give candid opinion fellow hang expel add few truculent 
44,"The Guinea-pigs, on the other hand, whatever they thought, protested vehemently that Greenfield senior was the most virtuous, heroic, saintly, and jolly fellow in all Saint Dominic's, and denounced the Tadpoles and all the rest of the school as the most brutal ruffians in Christendom.",guinea pig other hand think protest senior virtuous heroic saintly jolly fellow denounce rest school brutal ruffian 
45,"""They ought all to be expelled, every one of them,"" said one; ""all except Greenfield senior, and I hope they will be.""",expel say senior hope

50,"""You wouldn't get any of them to touch him with a pair of tongs,"" added another.",get touch pair tong add 
51,"This was too much for Bramble, and another brief period of dust ensued. Then, comparative quiet once more prevailing, Paul said, ""I tell you what, _I_ mean to stick to Greenfield senior.""",much brief period dust ensue comparative quiet prevail say tell mean stick senior 
52,"""So do I,"" said another youth, with his face all over ink.  ""I mean _to fag_ for him.""",say youth face ink mean fag_

57,It was a magnificent idea!  And no sooner conceived than executed.,magnificent idea conceive execute 
58,There was a great rush of Guinea-pigs to Oliver's study.  He was not there.  So much the better.  They would give him a delightful surprise!,be great rush guinea pig study good give delightful surprise 
59,"So they proceeded straightway to empty his cupboards and drawers, to polish up his cups, to unfold his clothes and fold them again, to take down his books and put them up again, to upset his ink and mop it up with one of his handkerchiefs, to make his tea and spill it on the floor, to dirty his collars with their inky hands, to clean his boots with his hat-brush, and many other thoughtful and friendly acts calculated to make the heart of their hero glad.",proceed straightway empty cupboard drawer polish cup unfold clothes fold take book put upset ink mop handkerchief make tea spill floor dirty collar inky hand clean boot hat brush many other thoughtful friendly act calculate make heart hero glad 
60,"In the midst of their orgies, Wraysford and Pembury passed the door, and stopped to look in, wondering what on earth the tumult was about.  But they were greeted with such a storm of yells and hisses that they passed on, a little uneasy in their minds as to whether or no hydrophobia had broken out in Saint Dominic's.",midst orgie pass door stop look wonder earth tumult greet storm yell hiss pass little uneasy mind hydrophobia break 
61,"After them a detachment of Tadpoles, headed by Bramble appeared on the scene, for the purpose of mocking.  But, whatever their purpose may have been, it was abandoned for more active opposition when Paul presently emptied a tumblerful of lukewarm tea in the face of Master Bramble.",detachment head appear scene purpose mocking purpose abandon more active opposition empty tumblerful lukewarm tea face 
62,"A notable battle was fought on the threshold of Greenfield senior's study, in which many were wounded on both sides, and in the midst of which Oliver arrived on the scene, kicking right and left, and causing a general rout.",notable battle fight threshold senior study many wound side midst arrive scene kick leave cause general rout 
63,"How their hero appreciated the attentions his admirers had paid him during his absence the Guinea-pigs did not remain or return to ascertain.  They took for granted he was grateful, and bashfully kept out of the way of his thanks for a whole day.",hero appreciate attention admirer pay absence guinea pig remain return ascertain take grant grateful keep way thanks whole day 
64,"After that their enthusiasm returned, but this time it found a new vent. They decided that, although they would all fag for him to the end of his days, they would not for a season, at any rate, solicit jobs from him, but rather encourage him by their sympathy and applause at a more respectful distance.",enthusiasm return time find new vent decide fig end day season rate solicit job encourage sympathy applause respectful distance 
65,"So they took to cheering him in the playground, and following him down the passages.  And this not being enough, they further relieved themselves by hooting (at a respectful distance also) the chiefs of the senior school, whose opinions on the question of Greenfield senior were known not to agree with their own.",take cheer playground follow passage enough relieve hoot respectful distance chief senior school opinion question senior know agree own 
66,"If Oliver was not grateful for all this moral support in his trouble, he must have been a villain indeed of the deepest dye.  He never said in so many words he was grateful; but then the Guinea-pigs remembered that feelings are often too deep and too many for words, and so took for granted the thanks which their consciences told them they deserved.",grateful moral support trouble villain deep dye say many word grateful guinea pig remember feeling deep many word take grant thanks conscience tell deserve
