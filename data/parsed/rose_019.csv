1,CHAPTER XVIII. HOW THEY ALL JOURNEYED BACK TO THE CAPITAL,pourney capital 
2,"The Fairy Blackstick, by whose means this young King and Queen had certainly won their respective crowns back, would come not unfrequently, to pay them a little visit--as they were riding in their triumphal progress towards Giglio’s capital--change her wand into a pony, and travel by their Majesties’ side, giving them the very best advice. I am not sure that King Giglio did not think the Fairy and her advice rather a bore, fancying it was his own velour and merits which had put him on his throne, and conquered Padella: and, in fine, I fear he rather gave himself airs towards his best friend and patroness. She exhorted him to deal justly by his subjects, to draw mildly on the taxes, never to break his promise when he had once given it--and in all respects to be a good King.",means young win respective crown come pay little visit ride triumphal progress capital change wand pony travel side give good advice sure think advice bore fancy own velour merit put throne conquer fine fear give air good friend patroness exhort deal subject draw tax break promise give respect good 
3,"‘A good King, my dear Fairy!’ cries Rosalba. ‘Of course he will. Break his promise! can you fancy my Giglio would ever do anything so improper, so unlike him? No! never!’ And she looked fondly towards Giglio, whom she thought a pattern of perfection.",good dear cry course break promise fancy do improper look think pattern perfection 
4,"‘Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me, and telling me how to manage my government, and warning me to keep my word? Does she suppose that I am not a man of sense, and a man of honour?’ asks Giglio testily. ‘Methinks she rather presumes upon her position.’",advise tell manage government warning keep word suppose man sense man honour ask presume position 
5,"‘Hush! dear Giglio,’ says Rosalba. ‘You know Blackstick has been very kind to us, and we must not offend her.’ But the Fairy was not listening to Giglio’s testy observations, she had fallen back, and was trotting on her pony now, by Master Bulbo’s side, who rode a donkey, and made himself generally beloved in the army by his cheerfulness, kindness, and good-humour to everybody. He was eager to see his darling Angelica. He thought there never was such a charming being. Blackstick did not tell him it was the possession of the magic rose that made Angelica so lovely in his eyes. She brought him the very best accounts of his little wife, whose misfortunes and humiliations had indeed very greatly improved her; and, you see, she could whisk off on her wand a hundred miles in a minute, and be back in no time, and so carry polite messages from Bulbo to Angelica, and from Angelica to Bulbo, and comfort that young man upon his journey.",dear say know kind offend listen testy observation fall trot pony side ride donkey make beloved army cheerfulness kindness good humour eager see darling think be charming being tell possession magic rose make lovely eye bring good account little wife misfortune humiliation improve see whisk wand mile minute time carry polite message comfort young man journey 
6,"When the Royal party arrived at the last stage before you reach Blombodinga, who should be in waiting, in her carriage there with her lady of honour by her side, but the Princess Angelica! She rushed into her husband’s arms, scarcely stopping to make a passing curtsey to the King and Queen. She had no eyes but for Bulbo, who appeared perfectly lovely to her on account of the fairy ring which he wore; whilst she herself, wearing the magic rose in her bonnet, seemed entirely beautiful to the enraptured Bulbo.",royal arrive last stage reach wait carriage lady honour side rush husband arm stop make pass curtsey have eye appear lovely account fairy ring wear wear magic rose bonnet seem beautiful enrapture 
7,"A splendid luncheon was served to the Royal party, of which the Archbishop, the Chancellor, Duke Hedzoff, Countess Gruffanuff, and all our friends partook, the Fairy Blackstick being seated on the left of King Giglio, with Bulbo and Angelica beside her. You could hear the joy-bells ringing in the capital, and the guns which the citizens were firing off in honour of their Majesties.",splendid luncheon serve royal chancellor friend partaok seat left hear joy bell ring capital gun citizen fire honour 
8,"‘What can have induced that hideous old Gruffanuff to dress herself up in such an absurd way? Did you ask her to be your bridesmaid, my dear?’ says Giglio to Rosalba. ‘What a figure of fun Gruffy is!’",induce hideous old dress absurd way ask bridesmaid dear say figure fun 
9,"Gruffy was seated opposite their Majesties, between the Archbishop and the Lord Chancellor, and a figure of fun she certainly was, for she was dressed in a low white silk dress, with lace over, a wreath of white roses on her wig, a splendid lace veil, and her yellow old neck was covered with diamonds. She ogled the King in such a manner that His Majesty burst out laughing.",seat figure fun dress low white silk dress lace wreath white rose wig splendid lace veil yellow old neck cover diamond ogl manner burst laugh 
10,"‘Eleven o’clock!’ cries Giglio, as the great Cathedral bell of Blombodinga tolled that hour. ‘Gentlemen and ladies, we must be starting. Archbishop, you must be at church, I think, before twelve?’",o'clock cry great bell toll hour lady start church think 
11,"‘We must be at church before twelve,’ sighs out Gruffanuff in a languishing voice, hiding her old face behind her fan.",church sigh languish voice hide old face fan 
12,"‘And then I shall be the happiest man in my dominions,’ cries Giglio, with an elegant bow to the blushing Rosalba.",happy man dominion cry elegant bow blushing 
13,"‘Oh, my Giglio! Oh, my dear Majesty!’ exclaims Gruffanuff; ‘and can it be that this happy moment at length has arrived--’",dear exclaim happy moment length arrive 
14,"‘Of course it has arrived,’ says the King.",course arrive say 
15,"‘--and that I am about to become the enraptured bride of my adored Giglio!’ continues Gruffanuff. ‘Lend me a smelling-bottle, somebody. I certainly shall faint with joy.’",about become enraptured bride adore continue lend smelling bottle faint joy 
16,‘YOU my bride?’ roars out Giglio.,bride roar 
17,‘YOU marry my Prince?’ cried poor little Rosalba.,marry cry poor little 
18,"‘Pooh! Nonsense! The woman’s mad!’ exclaims the King. And all the courtiers exhibited by their countenances and expressions, marks of surprise, or ridicule, or incredulity, or wonder.",nonsense woman mad exclaim courtier exhibit countenance expression mark surprise ridicule incredulity wonder 
19,"‘I should like to know who else is going to be married, if I am not?’ shrieks out Gruffanuff. ‘I should like to know if King Giglio is a gentleman, and if there is such a thing as justice in Paflagonia? Lord Chancellor! my Lord Archbishop! will your Lordships sit by and see a poor, fond, confiding, tender creature put upon? Has not Prince Giglio promised to marry his Barbara? Is not this Giglio’s signature? Does not this paper declare that he is mine, and only mine?’ And she handed to his Grace the Archbishop the document which the Prince signed that evening when she wore the magic ring, and Giglio drank so much champagne. And the old Archbishop, taking out his eyeglasses, read--",like know go married shriek like know gentleman be thing justice lordship sit see poor fond confide tender creature put promise marry signature paper declare hand document sign evening wear magic ring drink much champagne old take eyeglass read 
20,"“‘This is to give notice, that I, Giglio, only son of Savio, King of Paflagonia, hereby promise to marry the charming Barbara Griselda, Countess Gruffanuff, and widow of the late Jenkins Gruffanuff, Esq.”",give notice son promise marry charming widow late 
21,"‘H’m,’ says the Archbishop, ‘the document is certainly a--a document.’",say document document 
22,"‘Phoo!’ says the Lord Chancellor, ‘the signature is not in His Majesty’s handwriting.’ Indeed, since his studies at Bosforo, Giglio had made an immense improvement in caligraphy.",say signature handwriting study make immense improvement caligraphy 
23,"‘Is it your handwriting, Giglio?’ cries the Fairy Blackstick, with an awful severity of countenance.",handwriting cry awful severity countenance 
24,"‘Y--y--y--es,’ poor Giglio gasps out, ‘I had quite forgotten the confounded paper: she can’t mean to hold me by it. You old wretch, what will you take to let me off? Help the Queen, some one--Her Majesty has fainted.’",poor gasp forget confound paper mean hold old wretch take let help faint 
25,"‘Chop her head off!’ } exclaim the impetuous ‘Smother the old witch!’ } Hedzoff, the ardent Smith, and ‘Pitch her into the river!’ } the faithful Jones.",chop head exclaim impetuous smother old witch ardent pitch river faithful 
26,"But Gruffanuff flung her arms round the Archbishop’s neck, and bellowed out, ‘Justice, justice, my Lord Chancellor!’ so loudly, that her piercing shrieks caused everybody to pause. As for Rosalba, she was borne away lifeless by her ladies; and you may imagine the look of agony which Giglio cast towards that lovely being, as his hope, his joy, his darling, his all in all, was thus removed, and in her place the horrid old Gruffanuff rushed up to his side, and once more shrieked out, ‘Justice, justice!’",flung arm neck bellow justice pierce shriek cause pause borne lifeless lady imagine look agony cast lovely being hope joy darling remove place horrid old rush side shriek justice

32,"‘What were all Europe to me without YOU, my Giglio?’ cries Gruff, kissing his hand.",cry kiss hand 
33,"‘I won’t, I can’t, I shan’t,--I’ll resign the crown first,’ shouts Giglio, tearing away his hand; but Gruff clung to it.",resign crown shout tear hand cling 
34,"‘I have a competency, my love,’ she says, ‘and with thee and a cottage thy Barbara will be happy.’",have competency love say cottage happy 
35,"Giglio was half mad with rage by this time. ‘I will not marry her,’ says he. ‘Oh, Fairy, Fairy, give me counsel?’ And as he spoke he looked wildly round at the severe face of the Fairy Blackstick.",mad rage time marry say give counsel speak look severe face 
36,"“‘Why is Fairy Blackstick always advising me, and warning me to keep my word? Does she suppose that I am not a man of honour?”’ said the Fairy, quoting Giglio’s own haughty words. He quailed under the brightness of her eyes; he felt that there was no escape for him from that awful inquisition.",advise warning keep word suppose man honour say quote own haughty word quail brightness eye feel be escape awful inquisition 
37,"‘Well, Archbishop,’ said he in a dreadful voice, that made his Grace start, ‘since this Fairy has led me to the height of happiness but to dash me down into the depths of despair, since I am to lose Rosalba, let me at least keep my honour. Get up, Countess, and let us be married; I can keep my word, but I can die afterwards.’",say dreadful voice make start lead height happiness dash depth despair lose let least keep honour get let married keep word die 
38,"‘Oh, dear Giglio,’ cries Gruffanuff, skipping up, ‘I knew, I knew I could trust thee--I knew that my Prince was the soul of honour. Jump into your carriages, ladies and gentlemen, and let us go to church at once; and as for dying, dear Giglio, no, no:--thou wilt forget that insignificant little chambermaid of a Queen--thou wilt live to be consoled by thy Barbara! She wishes to be a Queen, and not a Queen Dowager, my gracious Lord!’ And hanging upon poor Giglio’s arm, and leering and grinning in his face in the most disgusting manner, this old wretch tripped off in her white satin shoes, and jumped into the very carriage which had been got ready to convey Giglio and Rosalba to church. The cannons roared again, the bells pealed triple-bobmajors, the people came out flinging flowers upon the path of the royal bride and bridegroom, and Gruff looked out of the gilt coach window and bowed and grinned to them. Phoo! the horrid old wretch!",dear cry skip know know trust know soul honour jump carriage lady gentleman let go church die dear forget insignificant little chambermaid live console wish gracious lord hang poor arm leer grinn face disgusting manner old wretch trip white satin shoe jump very carriage get ready convey church cannon roar bell peal triple bobmajor person come fling flower path royal bride bridegroom look gilt coach window bow grin horrid old wretch
