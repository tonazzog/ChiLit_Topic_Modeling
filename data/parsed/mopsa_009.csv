4," When breakfast was over, the guests got up, one after the other, without taking the least notice of the Queen; and the tent began to get so thin and transparent that you could see the trees and the sky through it. At last, it looked only like a colored mist, with blue, and green, and yellow stripes, and then it was gone; and the table and all the things on it began to go in the same way. Only Jack, and the apple-woman, and Mopsa were left, sitting on their chairs, with the Queen between them.",breakfast guest get other take least notice tent begin get thin transparent see tree sky last look colored mist blue green yellow stripe gone table thing begin go same way apple woman leave sit chair 
5,"Presently, the Queen's lips began to move, and her eyes looked straight before her, as she sat upright in her chair. Whereupon the apple-woman snatched up Mopsa, and, seizing Jack's hand, hurried him off, exclaiming, ""Come away! come away! She is going to tell one of her stories; and if you listen, you'll be obliged to go to sleep, and sleep nobody knows how long.""",lip begin move eye look sit chair apple woman snatch seize hand hurry exclaim come come go tell story listen oblige go sleep sleep know 
6,"Jack did not want to go to sleep; he wished to go down to the river again, and see what had become of his boat, for he had left his cap and several other things in it.",want go sleep wish go river see become boat leave cap several other thing 
7,"So he parted from the apple-woman,--who took Mopsa with her, and said he would find her again when he wanted her at her apple-stall,--and went down to the boat, where he saw that his faithful hound was there before him.",part apple woman take say find want apple stall go boat see faithful hound 
8,"""It was lucky, master, that I came when I did,"" said the hound, ""for a dozen or so of those one-foot-one fellows were just shoving it off, and you will want it at night to sleep in.""",lucky master come say hound foot fellow shove want night sleep 
9,"""Yes,"" said Jack; ""and I can stretch the bit of purple silk to make a canopy over head,--a sort of awning,--for I should not like to sleep in tents or palaces that are inclined to melt away.""",say stretch bit purple silk make canopy head sort awning like sleep tent palace inclined melt 
10,"So the hound with his teeth, and Jack with his hands, pulled and pulled at the silk till it was large enough to make a splendid canopy, like a tent; and it reached down to the water's edge, and roofed in all the after part of the boat.",hound tooth hand pull pull silk large make splendid canopy tent reach water edge roof part boat 
11,"So now he had a delightful little home of his own; and there was no fear of its being blown away, for no wind ever blows in Fairyland. All the trees are quite still, no leaf rustles, and the flowers lie on the ground exactly where they fall.",have delightful little home own be fear blow wind blow tree leaf rustle flower lie ground fall 
12,"After this Jack told the hound to watch his boat, and went himself in search of the apple-woman. Not one fairy was to be seen, any more than if he had been in his own country, and he wandered down the green margin of the river till he saw the apple-woman sitting at a small stall with apples on it, and cherries tied to sticks, and some dry-looking nuts. She had Mopsa on her knee, and had washed her face, and put a beautiful clean white frock on her.",tell hound watch boat go search apple woman fairy see more own country wander green margin river see apple woman sit small stall apple cherry tie stick dry look nut have knee wash face put beautiful clean white frock 
13,"""Where are all the fairies gone to?"" asked Jack.",fairy go ask 
14,"""I never take any notice of that common trash and their doings,"" she answered. ""When the Queen takes to telling her stories they are generally frightened, and go and sit in the tops of the trees.""",take notice common trash doing answer take tell story frighten go sit top tree 
15,"""But you seem very fond of Mopsa,"" said Jack, ""and she is one of them. You will help me to take care of her, won't you, tills she grows a little older?""",seem fond say help take care till grow little old 
16,"""Grows!"" said the apple-woman, laughing. ""Grows! Why you don't think, surely, that she will ever be any different from what she is now?""",grow say apple woman laugh grow think different 
17,"""I thought she would grow up,"" said Jack.",think grow say 
18,"""They never change so long as they last,"" answered the apple-woman, ""when once they are one-foot-one high.""",change last answer apple woman foot high 
19,"""Mopsa,"" said Jack, ""come here, and I'll measure you.""",say come measure 
20,"Mopsa came dancing towards Jack, and he tried to measure her, first with a yard measure that the apple-woman took out of her pocket, and then with a stick, and then with a bit of string; but Mopsa would not stand steady, and at last it ended in their having a good game of romps together, and a race; but when he carried her back, sitting on his shoulder, he was sorry to see that the apple-woman was crying again, and he asked her kindly what she did it for.",come dance try measure yard measure apple woman take pocket stick bit string stand steady last end have good game romp race carry sit shoulder sorry see apple woman cry ask do 
21,"""It is because,"" she answered, ""I shall never see my own country any more, nor any men and women and children, excepting such as by a rare chance stray in for a little while as you have done.""",answer see own country more man woman child except such rare chance stray little while do 
22,"""I can go back whenever I please,"" said Jack. ""Why don't you?""",go say 
23,"""Because I came in of my own good-will, after I had had fair warning that if I came at all it would end in my staying always. Besides, I don't know that I exactly wish to go home again: I should be afraid.""",come own good have fair warning come end stay know wish go afraid 
24,"""Afraid of what?"" asked Jack.",afraid ask 
25,"""Why, there's the rain and the cold, and not having anything to eat excepting what you earn. And yet,"" said the apple-woman, ""I have three boys of my own at home; one of them must be nearly a man by this time, and the youngest is about as old as you are. If I went home I might find one or more of those boys in jail, and then how miserable I should be.""",be rain cold have eat except earn say apple woman have boy own home man time young old go find more boy jail miserable 
26,"""But you are not happy as it is,"" said Jack. ""I have seen you cry.""",happy say see cry 
27,"""Yes,"" said the apple-woman; ""but now I live here I don't care about anything so much as I used to do. 'May I have a satin gown and a coach?' I asked, when first I came. 'You may have a hundred and fifty satin gowns if you like,' said the Queen, 'and twenty coaches with six cream-colored horses to each.' But when I had been here a little time, and found I could have everything I wished for, and change it as often as I pleased, I began not to care for anything; and at last I got so sick of all their grand things that I dressed myself in my own clothes that I came in, and made up my mind to have a stall and sit at it, as I used to do, selling apples. And I used to say to myself, 'I have but to wish with all my heart to go home, and I can go, I know that;' but oh dear! oh dear! I couldn't wish enough, for it would come into my head that I should be poor, or that my boys would have forgotten me, or that my neighbors would look down on me, and so I always put off wishing for another day. Now here is the Queen coming. Sit down on the grass and play with Mopsa. Don't let her see us talking together, lest she should think I have been telling you things which you ought not to know.""",say apple woman live care much use do have satin gown coach ask come have satin gown like say coach cream colored horse little time find have wish change pleased begin care last get sick grand thing dress own clothes come make mind have stall sit use do sell apple use say have wish heart go go know dear dear wish come head poor boy forget neighbor look put wish day come sit grass play let see talk think tell thing know 
28,"Jack looked, and saw the Queen coming slowly towards them, with her hands held out before her, as if it was dark. She felt her way, yet her eyes were wide open, and she was telling her stories all the time.",look see come hand hold dark feel way eye wide open tell story time 
29,"""Don't you listen to a word she says,"" whispered the apple-woman; and then, in order that Jack might not hear what the Queen was talking about, she began to sing.",listen word say whisper apple woman order hear talk begin sing 
30,"She had no sooner begun than up from the river came swarms of one-foot-one fairies to listen, and hundreds of them dropped down from the trees. The Queen, too, seemed to attend as they did, though she kept murmuring her story all the time; and nothing that any of them did appeared to surprise the apple-woman,--she sang as if nobody was taking any notice at all:--",begin river come swarm foot fairy listen hundred drop tree seem attend keep murmure story time appear surprise apple woman sing take notice 
31,"  When I sit on market-days amid the comers and the goers,     Oh! full oft I have a vision of the days without alloy,   And a ship comes up the river with a jolly gang of towers,     And a ""pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!""",sit market day comer goer full oft have vision day alloy ship come river jolly gang tower pull pull heave 
32,"  There is busy talk around me, all about mine ears it hummeth,     But the wooden wharves I look on, and a dancing, heaving buoy,   For 'tis tidetime in the river, and she cometh--oh, she cometh!     With a ""pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!""",be busy talk ear hummeth wooden wharve look dancing heave buoy tidetime river cometh cometh pull haul pull haul heave 
33,"  Then I hear the water washing, never golden waves were brighter,     And I hear the capstan creaking--'tis a sound that cannot cloy.   Bring her to, to ship her lading, brig or schooner, sloop or         lighter,     With a ""pull'e haul'e, pull'e haule, yoy! heave, hoy!""",hear water washing golden wave bright hear capstan creaking sound cloy bring ship lading brig schooner sloop light pull haul pull heave 
34,"  ""Will ye step aboard, my dearest? for the high seas lie before us.""     So I sailed adown the river in those days without alloy.   We are launched! But when, I wonder, shall a sweeter sound float         o'er us     Than yon ""pull'e haul'e, pull'e haul'e, yoy! heave, hoy!""",step dearest high sea lie sail river day alloy launch wonder sweeter sound float pull haul pull haul heave 
35,"As the apple-woman left off singing, the Queen moved away, still murmuring the words of her story, and Jack said,--",apple woman leave sing move murmure word story say 
36,"""Does the Queen tell stories of what has happened, or of what is going to happen?""",tell story happen go happen 
37,"""Why, of what is going to happen, of course,"" replied the woman. ""Anybody could tell the other sort.""",go happen course reply woman tell other sort 
38,"""Because I heard a little of it,"" observed Jack. ""I thought she was talking of me. She said 'So he took the measure, and Mopsa stood still for once, and he found she was only one foot high, and she grew a great deal after that. Yes, she can grow.'""",hear little observe think talk say take measure stand find foot high grow great deal grow 
39,"""That's a fine hearing, and a strange hearing,"" said the apple-woman; ""and what did she mutter next?""",fine hearing strange hearing say apple woman mutter 
40,"""Of how she heard me sobbing,"" replied Jack; ""and while you went on about stepping on board the ship, she said, 'He was very good to me, dear little fellow! But Fate is the name of my old mother, and she reigns here. Oh, she reigns! The fatal F is in her name, and I cannot take it out!'""",hear sobb reply go step board ship say good dear little fellow name old mother reign reign fatal name take 
41,"""Ah!"" replied the apple-woman, ""they all say that, and that they are fays, and that mortals call their history fable; they are always crying out for an alphabet without the fatal F.""",reply apple woman say fay mortal call history fable cry alphabet fatal 
42,"""And then she told how she heard Mopsa sobbing too,"" said Jack; ""sobbing among the reeds and rushes by the river side.""",tell hear sobb say sobb reed rushe river side 
43,"""There are no reeds, and no rushes either, here,"" said the apple-woman, ""and I have walked the river from end to end. I don't think much of that part of the story. But you are sure she said that Mopsa was short of her proper height?""",be reed rushe say apple woman walk river end end think much part story sure say short proper height 
44,"""Yes, and that she would grow; but that's nothing. In my country we always grow.""",grow country grow 
45,"""Hold your tongue about you country!"" said the apple-woman, sharply. ""Do you want to make enemies of them all?""",hold tongue country say apple woman want make enemy 
46,"Mopsa had been listening to this, and now she said, ""I don't love the Queen. She slapped my arm as she went by, and it hurts.""",listen say love slap arm go hurt 
47,"Mopsa showed her little fat arm as she spoke, and there was a red place on it.",show little fat arm speak be red place 
48,"""That's odd, too,"" said the apple-woman; ""there's nothing red in a common fairy's veins. They have sap in them: that's why they can't blush.""",odd say apple woman be red common fairy vein have sap blush 
49,"Just then the sun went down, and Mopsa got up on the apple-woman's lap, and went to sleep; and Jack, being tired, went to his boat and lay down under the purple canopy, his old hound lying at his feet to keep guard over him.",sun go get apple woman lap go sleep tired go boat lay purple canopy old hound lie foot keep guard 
50,"The next morning, when he woke, a pretty voice called to him, ""Jack! Jack!"" and he opened his eyes and saw Mopsa. The apple-woman had dressed her in a clean frock and blue shoes, and her hair was so long! She was standing on the landing-place, close to him. ""O Jack! I'm so big,"" she said. ""I grew in the night; look at me.""",next morning wake pretty voice call open eye see apple woman dress clean frock blue shoe hair long stand landing place close big say grow night look 
51,"Jack looked. Yes, Mopsa had grown indeed; she had only just reached to his knee the day before, and now her little bright head, when he measured her, came as high as the second button of his waistcoat.",look grow reach knee day little bright head measure come high second button waistcoat 
52,"""But I hope you will not go on growing so fast as this,"" said Jack, ""or you will be as tall as my mamma is in a week or two,--much too big for me to play with.""",hope go grow say tall mamma week big play
