2," I do not know how long I was ill. Mr. Bond, the horse-doctor, came every day. One day he bled me; John held a pail for the blood. I felt very faint after it and thought I should die, and I believe they all thought so too.",know ill horse doctor come day day ble hold pail blood feel faint think die believe think 
3,"Ginger and Merrylegs had been moved into the other stable, so that I might be quiet, for the fever made me very quick of hearing; any little noise seemed quite loud, and I could tell every one’s footstep going to and from the house. I knew all that was going on. One night John had to give me a draught; Thomas Green came in to help him. After I had taken it and John had made me as comfortable as he could, he said he should stay half an hour to see how the medicine settled. Thomas said he would stay with him, so they went and sat down on a bench that had been brought into Merrylegs’ stall, and put down the lantern at their feet, that I might not be disturbed with the light.",move other stable quiet fever make quick hear little noise seem loud tell one footstep go house know go night have give draught come help take make comfortable say stay hour see medicine settle say stay go sit bench bring stall put lantern foot disturb light 
4,"For awhile both men sat silent, and then Tom Green said in a low voice:",man sit silent say low voice 
5,"“I wish, John, you’d say a bit of a kind word to Joe. The boy is quite broken-hearted; he can’t eat his meals, and he can’t smile. He says he knows it was all his fault, though he is sure he did the best he knew, and he says if Beauty dies no one will ever speak to him again. It goes to my heart to hear him. I think you might give him just a word; he is not a bad boy.”",wish say bit kind word boy break hearted eat meal smile say know fault sure do good know say die speak go heart hear think give word bad boy 
6,"After a short pause John said slowly, “You must not be too hard upon me, Tom. I know he meant no harm, I never said he did; I know he is not a bad boy. But you see, I am sore myself; that horse is the pride of my heart, to say nothing of his being such a favorite with the master and mistress; and to think that his life may be flung away in this manner is more than I can bear. But if you think I am hard on the boy I will try to give him a good word to-morrow--that is, I mean if Beauty is better.”",short pause say hard know mean harm say know bad boy see sore horse pride heart say favorite master mistress think life flung manner more bear think hard boy try give good word mean beauty good 
7,"“Well, John, thank you. I knew you did not wish to be too hard, and I am glad you see it was only ignorance.”",thank know wish hard glad see ignorance 
8,John’s voice almost startled me as he answered:,voice startle answer 
9,"“Only ignorance! only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance? Don’t you know that it is the worst thing in the world, next to wickedness?--and which does the most mischief heaven only knows. If people can say, ‘Oh! I did not know, I did not mean any harm,’ they think it is all right. I suppose Martha Mulwash did not mean to kill that baby when she dosed it with Dalby and soothing syrups; but she did kill it, and was tried for manslaughter.”",ignorance ignorance talk ignorance know bad thing world wickedness most mischief heaven know person say know mean harm think right suppose mean kill baby dose soothing syrup kill try manslaughter 
10,"“And serve her right, too,” said Tom. “A woman should not undertake to nurse a tender little child without knowing what is good and what is bad for it.”",serve right say woman undertake nurse tender little child know good bad 
11,"“Bill Starkey,” continued John, “did not mean to frighten his brother into fits when he dressed up like a ghost and ran after him in the moonlight; but he did; and that bright, handsome little fellow, that might have been the pride of any mother’s heart is just no better than an idiot, and never will be, if he lives to be eighty years old. You were a good deal cut up yourself, Tom, two weeks ago, when those young ladies left your hothouse door open, with a frosty east wind blowing right in; you said it killed a good many of your plants.”",continue mean frighten brother fit dress ghost run moonlight bright handsome little fellow pride mother heart good idiot live year old good deal cut week young lady leave hothouse door open frosty east wind blow say kill good many plant 
12,"“A good many!” said Tom; “there was not one of the tender cuttings that was not nipped off. I shall have to strike all over again, and the worst of it is that I don’t know where to go to get fresh ones. I was nearly mad when I came in and saw what was done.”",good many say be tender cutting nip have strike bad know go get fresh one mad come see do 
13,"“And yet,” said John, “I am sure the young ladies did not mean it; it was only ignorance.”",say sure young lady mean ignorance 
14,"I heard no more of this conversation, for the medicine did well and sent me to sleep, and in the morning I felt much better; but I often thought of John’s words when I came to know more of the world.",hear more conversation medicine do send sleep morning feel good think word come know more world
