4,"Dick would have considered it a very valuable prize indeed; he could have exhibited it to admiring friends--during lessons, of course, when it would prove a most agreeable distraction; he could have played with and fingered it incessantly, invented astonishing legends of its powers and virtues; and, at last, when he had grown tired of it, have bartered it for any more desirable article that might take his fancy. All these advantages were present to his mind in a vague shifting form, but he could not find either courage or words to explain them.",consider valuable prize exhibit admire friend lesson course prove agreeable distraction play finger invent astonish legend power virtue last grow tired barter desirable article take fancy advantage present mind vague shift form find courage word explain

7,"Marmaduke Paradine, his brother-in-law, was not a connection of whom he had much reason to feel particularly proud. One of those persons endowed with what are known as ""insinuating manners and address,"" he had, after some futile attempts to enter the army, been sent out to Bombay as agent for a Manchester firm, and in that capacity had contrived to be mixed up in some more than shady transactions with rival exporters and native dealers up the country, which led to an unceremonious dismissal by his employers.",brother law connection have much reason feel proud person endow know insinuate manners address futile attempt enter army send agent firm capacity contrive mix more shady transaction rival exporter native dealer country lead unceremonious dismissal employer 
8,"He had brought home the stone from India as a propitiatory token of remembrance, more portable and less expensive than the lacquered cabinets, brasses, stuffs and carved work which are expected from friends at such a distance, and he had been received with pardon and started once more, until certain other proceedings of his, shadier still, had obliged Paul to forbid him the house at Westbourne Terrace.",bring stone propitiatory token remembrance portable expensive lacquer cabinet brasse stuff carve work expect friend distance receive pardon start more certain other proceedings shadier oblige forbid house 
9,"Since then little had been heard of him, and the reports which reached Mr. Bultitude of his disreputable relative's connection with the promotion of a series of companies of the kind affected by the widow and curate, and exposed in money articles and law courts, gave him no desire to renew his acquaintance.",little hear report reach disreputable relative connection promotion series company kind affect widow curate expose money article law court give desire renew acquaintance

It's an excellent school--never saw a better expressed prospectus in my life. And my old friend Bangle, Sir Benjamin Bangle, who's a member of the School Board, and ought to know something about schools, strongly recommended it--would have sent his own son there, if he hadn't entered him at Eton.

21,"At this final blow to all his hopes, Dick began to sob in a subdued hopeless kind of way, which was more than his father could bear. To do Paul justice, he had not meant to be quite so harsh when the boy was about to set out for school, and, a little ashamed of his irritation, he sought to justify his decision.",final blow hope begin sob subdued hopeless kind way more father bear do justice mean harsh boy about set school little ashamed irritation seek justify decision 
22,"He chose to do this by delivering a short homily on the advantages of school, by which he might lead Dick to look on the matter in the calm light of reason and common sense, and commonplaces on the subject began to rise to the surface of his mind, from the rather muddy depths to which they had long since sunk.",choose do deliver short homily advantage school lead look matter calm light reason common sense commonplace subject begin rise surface mind muddy depth sink

""It's--ah--the usual thing for boys at school, I'm quite aware, to go about fancying they're very ill-used, and miserable, and all the rest of it, just as if people in my position had their sons educated out of spite!

And you mark my words, my boy, when they go out into the world and have real trials to put up with, and grow middle-aged men, like me, why, they see what fools they've been, Dick; they see what fools they've been.

30,"As he spoke these unlucky words, he felt a slight shiver, followed by a curious shrinking sensation all over him. It was odd, too, but the arm-chair in which he sat seemed to have grown so much bigger all at once. He felt a passing surprise, but concluded it must be fancy, and went on as comfortably as before.",speak unlucky word feel slight shiver follow curious shrink sensation odd arm chair sit seem grow big feel pass surprise conclude fancy go

36,"The wheels must have belonged to some other cab, for none had stopped at the pavement as yet; but Mr. Bultitude was justly indignant, and could stand the interview no longer. Dick, however, made no attempt to move; he remained there, choking and shaking with laughter, while his father sat stiffly on his chair, trying to ignore his son's unmannerly conduct, but only partially succeeding.",wheel belong other cab stop pavement indignant stand interview make attempt move remain choke shake laughter father sit chair try ignore son unmannerly conduct succeed

40,"There was the usual narrow sheet of plate glass at the back of the sideboard, and to this Mr. Bultitude walked, almost under protest, and with a cold dignity. It occurred to him that he might have a smudge on his face or something wrong with his collar and tie--something to account to some extent for his son's frivolous and insulting behaviour. No suspicion of the terrible truth crossed his mind as yet.",be usual narrow sheet plate glass back sideboard walk protest cold dignity occur have smudge face wrong collar tie account extent son frivolous insulting behaviour suspicion terrible truth cross mind

50,"They were indeed; the glass reflected now two small boys, each with chubby cheeks and auburn hair, both dressed, too, exactly alike, in Eton jackets and broad white collars; the only difference to be seen between them was that, while one face wore an expression of intense glee and satisfaction, the other--the one which Mr. Bultitude was beginning to fear must belong to him--was lengthened and drawn with dismay and bewilderment.",glass reflect small boy chubby cheek hair dress alike jacket broad white collar only difference see face wear expression intense glee satisfaction other one begin fear belong lengthen draw dismay bewilderment

110,"The transformed Dick began to skip and dance round the room in high glee, with as much agility as his increased bulk would allow. ""It's all right, you see,"" he said.

112,"As for Paul, he was perfectly furious at having been so outwitted and overreached. It was a long time before he could command his voice sufficiently to say, savagely: ""Well, you've had your way, and a pretty mess you've made of it. We're both of us in false positions now.

115,"Paul did not really mean this, he only meant to frighten him; for he still trusted that, by letting Boaler into the secret, the charm might be set in motion once more, and the difficulty comfortably overcome.

120,"""Why, you see,"" exclaimed Dick, ""it would never have done for us both to go back; the chaps would have humbugged us so, and as I hate the place and you seem so fond of being a boy and going back to school and that, I thought perhaps it would be best for you to go and see how you liked it!""",see exclaim do go chap humbugg hate place seem fond boy go school think good go see like 
121,"""I never will! I'll not stir from this room! I dare you to try to move me!"" cried Paul. And just then there was the sound of wheels outside once more.

125,"But Dick only warmed his coat tails at the fire as he said, with a very ungenerous reminiscence of his father's manner: ""You are going back to an excellent establishment, where you will enjoy all the comforts of home--I can specially recommend the stickjaw; look out for it on Tuesdays and Fridays. You will once more take part in the games and lessons of happy boyhood. (Did you ever play 'chevy' when you were a boy before? You'll enjoy chevy.)

129,"Paul turned indignantly from him to the butler; he, at least, would stand by him. Boaler would not see a master who had always been fair, if not indulgent, to him driven from his home in this cold-blooded manner!",turn butler least stand see master fair indulgent drive home cold blood manner 
130,"He made two or three attempts to speak, for his brain whirled so with scathing, burning things to say.

The whole household should be summoned and called upon to judge between the two!",make attempt speak brain whirl scathing burn thing say expose fraud defy impudent usurper warn one spurious pinchbeck imitation whole household summon call judge

Then the blackness closed over him--and he knew no more.",feel unfortunate position make more wild effort explain sense danger petrify mind stimulate spare further conflict dark mist rise eye wall room reced infinite space loud singing ear fall seem sink earth very crust antipode blackness close know more
