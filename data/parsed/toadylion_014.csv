3,"Prissy was the only soldier in the force with any religious convictions of a practical kind. On this occasion she actually wanted to send a mission to the foe with an offer of peace, on condition of their giving up Donald to his rightful owners. She instanced as an example of the kind of thing she meant, the verses about turning the other cheek. But General Napoleon had his answer ready.",only soldier force religious conviction practical kind occasion want send mission foe offer peace condition give rightful owner instance example kind thing mean verse turn other cheek have answer ready 
4,"""Well,"" he said, ""that's all right. That's in the Bible, so I s'pose you have got to believe it. But I was looking at it last Sunday in sermon time, and it doesn't say what you are to do _after_ you turn the other cheek. So yesterday I tried it on Tommy Pratt to see how it worked, and he hit me on the other cheek like winking, and made my eyes water. So then I took off my coat, and, Jove!--didn't I just give him Billy-O! Texts aren't so bad. They are mostly all right, if you only read on a bit!""",say right s'pose get believe look last sermon time say do _after_ turn other cheek yesterday try see work hit other cheek winking make eye water take coat give text bad right read bit 
5,"""But,"" said Prissy, ""perhaps you forgot that a soft answer turneth away wrath?""",say forget soft answer turneth wrath 
6,"""Don't, nother,"" contradicted Sir Toady Lion, whose pronunciation of ""wrath"" and ""horse"" was identical, and who persistently misunderstood the Scriptural statement which Janet Sheepshanks had once made him learn without explanation. ""Tried soft answer on big horse in the farm-yard, yesterday, and he didn't turn away a little bit, but comed right on, and tried to eat me _all_ up!""",contradict pronunciation wrath horse identical misunderstood scriptural statement make learn explanation try soft answer big horse farm yard yesterday turn little bit come try eat _all_

11,"""I don't yike the New Test'ment,"" commented Toady Lion in his shrill high pipe, which cuts through all other conversation as easily as a sharp knife cleaves a bar of soap; ""ain't never nobody killed dead in the New Test'ment!""",yike new comment shrill high pipe cut other conversation sharp knife cleave bar soap kill dead new

17,"During this discussion the two Generals of Division had been wholly silent. To them the New Testament was considerably outside the sphere of practical politics. Peter Greg indeed had one which he had got from his mother on his birthday with his name on the first page; and Mike, who was of the contrary persuasion as to the advisability of circulating the Written Word in the vulgar tongue, could always provoke a fight by threatening to burn it, to which Peter Greg invariably replied by a hasty and ungenerous expression of hope as to the future welfare of the head of the Catholic religion.",discussion division silent new sphere practical politics have get mother birthday name first page contrary persuasion advisability circulate write vulgar tongue provoke fight threaten burn reply hasty ungenerous expression hope future welfare head catholic religion 
18,"But all this was purely academical discussion. Neither of them knew nor cared one jot about the matter. Prissy alone was genuinely distressed, and so affected was she that two big tears of woe trickled down her cheeks. These she wiped off with her pinafore, turning away her eyes so that Hugh John might not see them. There was, however, no great danger of this, for that warrior preoccupied himself with shouting ""Right-left, Right-left,"" as if he were materially assisting the success of the expedition by doing so.",academical discussion know care jot matter prissy distressed affect big tear woe trickle cheek wipe pinafore turn eye see be great danger warrior preoccupy shouting right leave right left assist success expedition do 
19,"At the entrance to the pastures tenanted by butcher Donnan, the army divided into its two divisions under their several commanders. The Commander-in-Chief placed himself between the wings as a central division all by himself. It was Peter Greg who first reached the door, and with his stout cudgel knocked off the padlock. He had already entered in triumph, and was about to be followed by his soldiery, when a loud shout was heard from the edge of the park.",entrance pasture tenant butcher army divide division several commander place wing central division reach door stout cudgel knock padlock enter triumph about follow soldiery loud shout hear edge park 
20,"""Here they are--go at them! Give them fits, boys! We'll learn them to come sneaking into our field.""",go give fit boy learn come sneak field 
21,"And over the stone dikes, from the direction of the town of Edam, came an overpowering force of the enemy led by Nipper Donnan. They seemed to arrive from all parts at once, and with sticks and stones they advanced upon the slender array of the forces of Windy Standard. Their rude language, their threatening gestures, and their loud shouts intimidated but did not daunt the assailants. Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith called on his men to do or die; and everyone resolved that that was just what they were there for--all except Prissy, who promptly pulled up her skirts and went down the meadow towards the stepping-stones like a jenny-spinner driven by the wind, and Sir Toady Lion, who, finding an opening in the hedge about his size in holes, crept quietly through and was immediately followed by CÃ¦sar, the ""potwalloping"" Newfoundland pup.",stone dike direction town come overpowering force enemy lead seem arrive part stick stone advance slender array force windy rude language threatening gesture loud shout intimidate daunt assailant field call man do die resolve pull skirt go meadow step stone jenny spinner drive wind find opening hedge size hole creep follow potwalloping pup 
22,"The struggle which raged around those who remained staunch to the colours was grim and deadly. General-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith threw himself into the thickest of the fray, and the cry, ""A Smith for Merry England,"" alternated with the ringing ""Scotland for ever!"" which had so often carried terror into the hearts of the foe. Prince Michael O'Donowitch performed prodigies of valour, and personally ""downed"" three of the enemy with his national weapon. Peter Greg fought a pitched battle with Nipper Donnan, in which double-jointed words were as freely used as tightly clenched fists. Cissy Carter ""progged"" at least half-a-dozen of the enemy with her pike, before it was wrested from her by the united efforts of several town lads who were not going to stand being punched by a girl. Sammy Carter stood well out of the heady fray, and contented himself with stinging up the enemy with his vengeful catapult till they howled again.",struggle rage remain staunch colour grim deadly throw thickest fray cry merry alternate ringing carry terror heart foe perform prodigy valour down enemy national weapon fight pitch battle double joint word use clench fist progge least half enemy pike wrest united effort several town lad go stand punch girl stand heady fray content sting enemy vengeful catapult howl

24,"But the struggle of the many against the few, the strong against the weak, could only end in one way. In ten minutes the forces of law and disorder were scattered to the four quarters of heaven, and the standard that had streamed so rarely on the braes of Edam was in the hands of the exulting foe.",struggle many few strong weak end way minute force law disorder scatter quarter heaven standard stream brae hand exult foe
