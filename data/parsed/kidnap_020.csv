1,CHAPTER XIX. THE HOUSE OF FEAR,fear 
2,"Night fell as we were walking, and the clouds, which had broken up in the afternoon, settled in and thickened, so that it fell, for the season of the year, extremely dark. The way we went was over rough mountainsides; and though Alan pushed on with an assured manner, I could by no means see how he directed himself.",night fall walk cloud break afternoon settle thicken fall season year dark way go rough mountainside push assure manner means see direct 
3,"At last, about half-past ten of the clock, we came to the top of a brae, and saw lights below us. It seemed a house door stood open and let out a beam of fire and candle-light; and all round the house and steading five or six persons were moving hurriedly about, each carrying a lighted brand.",last half past clock come top brae see light seem house door stand open let beam fire candle light house stead person move carry light brand 
4,"“James must have tint his wits,” said Alan. “If this was the soldiers instead of you and me, he would be in a bonny mess. But I dare say he’ll have a sentry on the road, and he would ken well enough no soldiers would find the way that we came.”",tint wit say soldier bonny mess say have sentry road ke soldier find way come 
5,"Hereupon he whistled three times, in a particular manner. It was strange to see how, at the first sound of it, all the moving torches came to a stand, as if the bearers were affrighted; and how, at the third, the bustle began again as before.",whistle time particular manner strange see first sound move torche come stand bearer affrighted third bustle begin 
6,"Having thus set folks’ minds at rest, we came down the brae, and were met at the yard gate (for this place was like a well-doing farm) by a tall, handsome man of more than fifty, who cried out to Alan in the Gaelic.",set folk mind rest come brae meet yard gate place do farm tall handsome man more cry 
7,"“James Stewart,” said Alan, “I will ask ye to speak in Scotch, for here is a young gentleman with me that has nane of the other. This is him,”  he added, putting his arm through mine, “a young gentleman of the Lowlands, and a laird in his country too, but I am thinking it will be the better for his health if we give his name the go-by.”",say ask speak young gentleman have nane other add put arm young gentleman laird country think good health give name go 
8,"James of the Glens turned to me for a moment, and greeted me courteously enough; the next he had turned to Alan.",turn moment greet next turn 
9,"“This has been a dreadful accident,” he cried. “It will bring trouble on the country.” And he wrung his hands.",dreadful accident cry bring trouble country wrung hand 
10,"“Hoots!” said Alan, “ye must take the sour with the sweet, man. Colin Roy is dead, and be thankful for that!”",hoot say take sour sweet man dead thankful 
11,"“Ay” said James, “and by my troth, I wish he was alive again! It’s all very fine to blow and boast beforehand; but now it’s done, Alan; and who’s to bear the wyte* of it? The accident fell out in Appin--mind ye that, Alan; it’s Appin that must pay; and I am a man that has a family.”",say troth wish alive fine blow boast do bear wyte* accident fall mind pay man have family

13,"While this was going on I looked about me at the servants. Some were on ladders, digging in the thatch of the house or the farm buildings, from which they brought out guns, swords, and different weapons of war; others carried them away; and by the sound of mattock blows from somewhere farther down the brae, I suppose they buried them. Though they were all so busy, there prevailed no kind of order in their efforts; men struggled together for the same gun and ran into each other with their burning torches; and James was continually turning about from his talk with Alan, to cry out orders which were apparently never understood. The faces in the torchlight were like those of people overborne with hurry and panic; and though none spoke above his breath, their speech sounded both anxious and angry.",go look servant ladder digg thatch house farm building bring gun sword different weapon war other carry sound mattock blow brae suppose bury busy prevail kind order effort man struggle same gun run other burning torche turn talk cry order understand face torchlight person overborne hurry panic speak breath speech sound anxious angry 
14,It was about this time that a lassie came out of the house carrying a pack or bundle; and it has often made me smile to think how Alan’s instinct awoke at the mere sight of it.,time lassie come house carry pack bundle make smile think instinct awoke mere sight 
15,“What’s that the lassie has?” he asked.,lassie have ask 
16,"“We’re just setting the house in order, Alan,” said James, in his frightened and somewhat fawning way. “They’ll search Appin with candles, and we must have all things straight. We’re digging the bit guns and swords into the moss, ye see; and these, I am thinking, will be your ain French clothes. We’ll be to bury them, I believe.”",set house order say frighten fawn way search candle have thing digg bit gun sword moss see think ain french clothes bury believe 
17,"“Bury my French clothes!” cried Alan. “Troth, no!” And he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself, recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman.",bury french clothes cry lay hold packet retire barn shift recommend meanwhile kinsman 
18,"James carried me accordingly into the kitchen, and sat down with me at table, smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner. But presently the gloom returned upon him; he sat frowning and biting his fingers; only remembered me from time to time; and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile, and back into his private terrors. His wife sat by the fire and wept, with her face in her hands; his eldest son was crouched upon the floor, running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end; all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room, in a blind hurry of fear, and whimpering as she went; and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard, and cry for orders.",carry kitchen sit table smile talk first hospitable manner gloom return sit frown bite finger remember time time give word poor smile private terror wife sit fire goot face hand old son crouch floor run great mass paper set alight burn bitter end servant lass red face rummage room blind hurry fear whimper go man thrust face yard cry order 
19,"At last James could keep his seat no longer, and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about. “I am but poor company altogether, sir,”  says he, “but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident, and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons.”",last keep seat begg permission unmannerly walk poor company sir say think dreadful accident trouble bring innocent person 
20,A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept; and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness. He struck the lad repeatedly.,little observe son burn paper think keep excitement burst painful witness strike lad 
21,"“Are you gone gyte?” * he cried. “Do you wish to hang your father?” and forgetful of my presence, carried on at him a long time together in the Gaelic, the young man answering nothing; only the wife, at the name of hanging, throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before.",gone gyte cry wish hang father forgetful presence carry long time young man answer wife name hang throw apron face sobb louder

23,"This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see; and I was right glad when Alan returned, looking like himself in his fine French clothes, though (to be sure) they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine. I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons, and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need, and a pair of Highland brogues made of deer-leather, rather strange at first, but after a little practice very easy to the feet.",wretch stranger hear see glad return look fine french clothes sure grow batter wither deserve name fine take turn son give change clothing stand need pair brogue make deer leather strange first little practice easy foot 
24,"By the time I came back Alan must have told his story; for it seemed understood that I was to fly with him, and they were all busy upon our equipment. They gave us each a sword and pistols, though I professed my inability to use the former; and with these, and some ammunition, a bag of oatmeal, an iron pan, and a bottle of right French brandy, we were ready for the heather. Money, indeed, was lacking. I had about two guineas left; Alan’s belt having been despatched by another hand, that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune; and as for James, it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants, that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny, the most of it in coppers.",time come tell story seem understand fly busy equipment give sword pistol profess inability use former ammunition bag oatmeal iron pan bottle right french brandy ready heather money lack have guinea leave belt despatch hand trusty messenger have more pence whole fortune appear bring low journey legal expense behalf tenant scrape pence halfpenny most copper 
25,"“This’ll no do,” said Alan.",do say 
26,"“Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by,” said James, “and get word sent to me. Ye see, ye’ll have to get this business prettily off, Alan. This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two. They’re sure to get wind of ye, sure to seek ye, and by my way of it, sure to lay on ye the wyte of this day’s accident. If it falls on you, it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country. And if it comes on me----” he paused, and bit his fingers, with a white face. “It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang,” said he.",find safe bit say get word send see have get business time stay guinea sure get wind sure seek way sure lay wyte day accident fall fall near kinsman harboure country come pause bite finger white face painful thing friend hang say

29,"“Well, and that’s true, too,” said Alan; “and my friend from the Lowlands here” (nodding at me) “gave me a good word upon that head, if I would only have listened to him.”",true say friend nodd give good word head listen 
30,"“But see here,” said James, returning to his former manner, “if they lay me by the heels, Alan, it’s then that you’ll be needing the money. For with all that I have said and that you have said, it will look very black against the two of us; do ye mark that? Well, follow me out, and ye’ll, I’ll see that I’ll have to get a paper out against ye mysel’; have to offer a reward for ye; ay, will I! It’s a sore thing to do between such near friends; but if I get the dirdum* of this dreadful accident, I’ll have to fend for myself, man.

34,"“And ye’ll have to be clear of the country, Alan--ay, and clear of Scotland--you and your friend from the Lowlands, too. For I’ll have to paper your friend from the Lowlands. Ye see that, Alan--say that ye see that!”",have clear country clear friend have paper friend see say see 
35,"I thought Alan flushed a bit. “This is unco hard on me that brought him here, James,” said he, throwing his head back. “It’s like making me a traitor!”",think flush bit hard bring say throw head make traitor 
36,"“Now, Alan, man!” cried James. “Look things in the face! He’ll be papered anyway; Mungo Campbell’ll be sure to paper him; what matters if I paper him too? And then, Alan, I am a man that has a family.” And then, after a little pause on both sides, “And, Alan, it’ll be a jury of Campbells,” said he.",man cry look thing face paper sure paper matter paper man have family little pause side jury say

38,"“Nor yet they shallnae, Alan! There’s my hand on that,” cried James, for all the world as if he had really known my name and was foregoing some advantage. “But just the habit he was in, and what he looked like, and his age, and the like? I couldnae well do less.”",shallnae be hand cry world know name forego advantage habit look age like noe do less 
39,"“I wonder at your father’s son,” cried Alan, sternly. “Would ye sell the lad with a gift? Would ye change his clothes and then betray him?”",wonder father son cry sell lad gift change clothes betray 
40,"“No, no, Alan,” said James. “No, no: the habit he took off--the habit Mungo saw him in.” But I thought he seemed crestfallen; indeed, he was clutching at every straw, and all the time, I dare say, saw the faces of his hereditary foes on the bench, and in the jury-box, and the gallows in the background.",say habit take habit see think seem crestfallen clutch straw time say see face hereditary foe bench jury box gallow background 
41,"“Well, sir,” says Alan, turning to me, “what say ye to that? Ye are here under the safeguard of my honour; and it’s my part to see nothing done but what shall please you.”",sir say turn say safeguard honour part see do please 
42,"“I have but one word to say,” said I; “for to all this dispute I am a perfect stranger. But the plain common-sense is to set the blame where it belongs, and that is on the man who fired the shot. Paper him, as ye call it, set the hunt on him; and let honest, innocent folk show their faces in safety.” But at this both Alan and James cried out in horror; bidding me hold my tongue, for that was not to be thought of; and asking me what the Camerons would think? (which confirmed me, it must have been a Cameron from Mamore that did the act) and if I did not see that the lad might be caught? “Ye havenae surely thought of that?” said they, with such innocent earnestness, that my hands dropped at my side and I despaired of argument.",have word say say dispute perfect stranger plain common sense set blame belong man fire shot paper call set hunt let honest innocent folk show face safety cry horror bid hold tongue think ask think confirm do act see lad catch havenae think say such innocent earnestness hand drop side despair argument 
43,"“Very well, then,” said I, “paper me, if you please, paper Alan, paper King George! We’re all three innocent, and that seems to be what’s wanted. But at least, sir,” said I to James, recovering from my little fit of annoyance, “I am Alan’s friend, and if I can be helpful to friends of his, I will not stumble at the risk.”",say paper paper paper innocent seem want least sir say recover little fit annoyance friend helpful friend stumble risk 
44,"I thought it best to put a fair face on my consent, for I saw Alan troubled; and, besides (thinks I to myself), as soon as my back is turned, they will paper me, as they call it, whether I consent or not. But in this I saw I was wrong; for I had no sooner said the words, than Mrs. Stewart leaped out of her chair, came running over to us, and wept first upon my neck and then on Alan’s, blessing God for our goodness to her family.",think good put fair face consent see trouble think back turn paper call consent see wrong say word leap chair come run goot neck bless goodness family 
45,"“As for you, Alan, it was no more than your bounden duty,” she said. “But for this lad that has come here and seen us at our worst, and seen the goodman fleeching like a suitor, him that by rights should give his commands like any king--as for you, my lad,” she says, “my heart is wae not to have your name, but I have your face; and as long as my heart beats under my bosom, I will keep it, and think of it, and bless it.”  And with that she kissed me, and burst once more into such sobbing, that I stood abashed.",more bounden duty say lad come see bad see goodman fleech suitor right give command king lad say heart be have name have face heart beat bosom keep think bless kiss burst such sobbing stand abashed 
46,"“Hoot, hoot,” said Alan, looking mighty silly. “The day comes unco soon in this month of July; and to-morrow there’ll be a fine to-do in Appin, a fine riding of dragoons, and crying of ‘Cruachan!’ * and running of red-coats; and it behoves you and me to the sooner be gone.”",hoot hoot say look silly day come month fine do fine riding dragoon cry running red coat behove gone
