1,CHAPTER VI. MR. TOAD,
2,"It was a bright morning in the early part of summer; the river had resumed its wonted banks and its accustomed pace, and a hot sun seemed to be pulling everything green and bushy and spiky up out of the earth towards him, as if by strings. The Mole and the Water Rat had been up since dawn, very busy on matters connected with boats and the opening of the boating season; painting and varnishing, mending paddles, repairing cushions, hunting for missing boat-hooks, and so on; and were finishing breakfast in their little parlour and eagerly discussing their plans for the day, when a heavy knock sounded at the door.",bright morning early part summer river resume wont bank accustom pace hot sun seem pull green bushy spiky earth string dawn busy matter connect boat opening boating season painting varnishing mend paddle repair cushion hunting missing boat hook finish breakfast little parlour discuss plan day heavy knock sound door

4,"The Mole went to attend the summons, and the Rat heard him utter a cry of surprise. Then he flung the parlour door open, and announced with much importance, ‘Mr. Badger!’",go attend summons hear utter cry surprise flung parlour door open announce much importance 
5,"This was a wonderful thing, indeed, that the Badger should pay a formal call on them, or indeed on anybody. He generally had to be caught, if you wanted him badly, as he slipped quietly along a hedgerow of an early morning or a late evening, or else hunted up in his own house in the middle of the Wood, which was a serious undertaking.",wonderful thing pay formal call have catch want slip hedgerow early morning late evening hunt own house middle serious undertaking

The Rat let his egg-spoon fall on the table-cloth, and sat open-mouthed.",strode room stand look animal expression full seriousness let egg spoon fall table cloth sit open mouthed

10,"‘Toad’s hour, of course!’ cried the Mole delightedly. ‘Hooray! I remember now! WE’LL teach him to be a sensible Toad!’",hour course cry hooray remember teach sensible toad 
11,"‘This very morning,’ continued the Badger, taking an arm-chair, ‘as I learnt last night from a trustworthy source, another new and exceptionally powerful motor-car will arrive at Toad Hall on approval or return. At this very moment, perhaps, Toad is busy arraying himself in those singularly hideous habiliments so dear to him, which transform him from a (comparatively) good-looking Toad into an Object which throws any decent-minded animal that comes across it into a violent fit. We must be up and doing, ere it is too late. You two animals will accompany me instantly to Toad Hall, and the work of rescue shall be accomplished.’",very morning continue take arm chair learn last night trustworthy source new powerful motor car arrive approval return very moment busy array hideous habiliment dear transform good look toad object throw decent minded animal come violent fit do late animal accompany work rescue accomplish

14,"They reached the carriage-drive of Toad Hall to find, as the Badger had anticipated, a shiny new motor-car, of great size, painted a bright red (Toad’s favourite colour), standing in front of the house. As they neared the door it was flung open, and Mr. Toad, arrayed in goggles, cap, gaiters, and enormous overcoat, came swaggering down the steps, drawing on his gauntleted gloves.",reach carriage drive find anticipate shiny new motor car great size paint bright red favourite colour stand front house near door flung open array goggle cap gaiter enormous overcoat come swagger step draw gauntleted glove

Then, as Toad was hustled through the door, struggling and protesting, he turned to the chauffeur in charge of the new motor-car.",strode step take say companion hustle door struggle protest turn chauffeur charge new motor car

You needn’t wait.’ Then he followed the others inside and shut the door.",afraid want day say change mind require car understand final wait follow other shut door

21,"‘Take them off him, then, you two,’ ordered the Badger briefly.",take order 
22,"They had to lay Toad out on the floor, kicking and calling all sorts of names, before they could get to work properly. Then the Rat sat on him, and the Mole got his motor-clothes off him bit by bit, and they stood him up on his legs again. A good deal of his blustering spirit seemed to have evaporated with the removal of his fine panoply. Now that he was merely Toad, and no longer the Terror of the Highway, he giggled feebly and looked from one to the other appealingly, seeming quite to understand the situation.",have lay floor kick call sort name get work sit get motor clothes bit bit stand leg good deal bluster spirit seem evaporate removal fine panoply giggle look other seem understand situation 
23,"‘You knew it must come to this, sooner or later, Toad,’ the Badger explained severely.",know come explain 
24,"‘You’ve disregarded all the warnings we’ve given you, you’ve gone on squandering the money your father left you, and you’re getting us animals a bad name in the district by your furious driving and your smashes and your rows with the police. Independence is all very well, but we animals never allow our friends to make fools of themselves beyond a certain limit; and that limit you’ve reached. Now, you’re a good fellow in many respects, and I don’t want to be too hard on you. I’ll make one more effort to bring you to reason. You will come with me into the smoking-room, and there you will hear some facts about yourself; and we’ll see whether you come out of that room the same Toad that you went in.’",disregard warning give go squander money father leave get animal bad name district furious driving smash row police independence animal allow friend make fool certain limit limit reach good fellow many respect want hard make more effort bring reason come smoking room hear fact see come room same toad go

26,‘THAT’S no good!’ said the Rat contemptuously. ‘TALKING to Toad’ll never cure him. He’ll SAY anything.’,good say taloing cure say 
27,"They made themselves comfortable in armchairs and waited patiently. Through the closed door they could just hear the long continuous drone of the Badger’s voice, rising and falling in waves of oratory; and presently they noticed that the sermon began to be punctuated at intervals by long-drawn sobs, evidently proceeding from the bosom of Toad, who was a soft-hearted and affectionate fellow, very easily converted--for the time being--to any point of view.",make comfortable armchair wait close door hear long continuous drone voice rise fall wave oratory notice sermon begin punctuate interval long draw sob proceed bosom soft hearted affectionate fellow convert time point view 
28,"After some three-quarters of an hour the door opened, and the Badger reappeared, solemnly leading by the paw a very limp and dejected Toad. His skin hung baggily about him, his legs wobbled, and his cheeks were furrowed by the tears so plentifully called forth by the Badger’s moving discourse.",quarter hour door open reappear lead paw limp dejected skin hang leg wobble cheek furrow tear call move discourse 
29,"‘Sit down there, Toad,’ said the Badger kindly, pointing to a chair. ‘My friends,’ he went on, ‘I am pleased to inform you that Toad has at last seen the error of his ways. He is truly sorry for his misguided conduct in the past, and he has undertaken to give up motor-cars entirely and for ever.

33,"‘There’s only one thing more to be done,’ continued the gratified Badger. ‘Toad, I want you solemnly to repeat, before your friends here, what you fully admitted to me in the smoking-room just now. First, you are sorry for what you’ve done, and you see the folly of it all?’",be thing more do continue gratified want repeat friend admit smoking room sorry do see folly

37,"‘Oh, yes, yes, in THERE,’ said Toad impatiently. ‘I’d have said anything in THERE. You’re so eloquent, dear Badger, and so moving, and so convincing, and put all your points so frightfully well--you can do what you like with me in THERE, and you know it. But I’ve been searching my mind since, and going over things in it, and I find that I’m not a bit sorry or repentant really, so it’s no earthly good saying I am; now, is it?’",say say eloquent dear move convincing put point do like know search mind go thing find bit sorry repentant earthly good say

41,"‘Very well, then,’ said the Badger firmly, rising to his feet. ‘Since you won’t yield to persuasion, we’ll try what force can do. I feared it would come to this all along. You’ve often asked us three to come and stay with you, Toad, in this handsome house of yours; well, now we’re going to. When we’ve converted you to a proper point of view we may quit, but not before. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him up in his bedroom, while we arrange matters between ourselves.’",say rise foot yield persuasion try force do fear come ask come stay handsome house go convert proper point view quit take lock bedroom arrange matter

47,"‘It’s going to be a tedious business,’ said the Badger, sighing. ‘I’ve never seen Toad so determined. However, we will see it out. He must never be left an instant unguarded. We shall have to take it in turns to be with him, till the poison has worked itself out of his system.’",go tedious business say sigh see determine see leave instant unguarded have take turn poison work system 
48,"They arranged watches accordingly. Each animal took it in turns to sleep in Toad’s room at night, and they divided the day up between them. At first Toad was undoubtedly very trying to his careful guardians. When his violent paroxysms possessed him he would arrange bedroom chairs in rude resemblance of a motor-car and would crouch on the foremost of them, bent forward and staring fixedly ahead, making uncouth and ghastly noises, till the climax was reached, when, turning a complete somersault, he would lie prostrate amidst the ruins of the chairs, apparently completely satisfied for the moment. As time passed, however, these painful seizures grew gradually less frequent, and his friends strove to divert his mind into fresh channels. But his interest in other matters did not seem to revive, and he grew apparently languid and depressed.",arrange watch animal take turn sleep room night divide day first try careful guardian violent paroxysm possess arrange bedroom chair rude resemblance motor car crouch foremost bend stare make uncouth ghastly noise climax reach turn complete somersault lie prostrate ruin chair satisfied moment time pass painful seizure grow frequent friend strive divert mind fresh channel interest other matter seem revive grow languid depressed 
49,"One fine morning the Rat, whose turn it was to go on duty, went upstairs to relieve Badger, whom he found fidgeting to be off and stretch his legs in a long ramble round his wood and down his earths and burrows. ‘Toad’s still in bed,’ he told the Rat, outside the door. ‘Can’t get much out of him, except, “O leave him alone, he wants nothing, perhaps he’ll be better presently, it may pass off in time, don’t be unduly anxious,” and so on. Now, you look out, Rat! When Toad’s quiet and submissive and playing at being the hero of a Sunday-school prize, then he’s at his artfullest. There’s sure to be something up. I know him. Well, now, I must be off.’",fine morning turn go duty go relieve find fidget stretch leg long ramble wood earth burrow bed tell door get much leave want good pass time anxious look quiet submissive play hero school prize artfullest be sure know

52,"‘O, WE’RE all right,’ replied the Rat. ‘Mole,’ he added incautiously, ‘is going out for a run round with Badger. They’ll be out till luncheon time, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together, and I’ll do my best to amuse you. Now jump up, there’s a good fellow, and don’t lie moping there on a fine morning like this!’",right reply add go run luncheon time spend pleasant morning do good amuse jump be good fellow lie mope fine morning 
53,"‘Dear, kind Rat,’ murmured Toad, ‘how little you realise my condition, and how very far I am from “jumping up” now--if ever! But do not trouble about me. I hate being a burden to my friends, and I do not expect to be one much longer. Indeed, I almost hope not.’",dear kind murmure little realise condition jump trouble hate burden friend expect hope 
54,"‘Well, I hope not, too,’ said the Rat heartily. ‘You’ve been a fine bother to us all this time, and I’m glad to hear it’s going to stop. And in weather like this, and the boating season just beginning! It’s too bad of you, Toad! It isn’t the trouble we mind, but you’re making us miss such an awful lot.’",hope say fine bother time glad hear go stop weather boating season begin bad trouble mind make miss awful lot 
55,"‘I’m afraid it IS the trouble you mind, though,’ replied the Toad languidly. ‘I can quite understand it. It’s natural enough. You’re tired of bothering about me. I mustn’t ask you to do anything further. I’m a nuisance, I know.’",afraid trouble mind reply understand natural tired bother ask do nuisance know 
56,"‘You are, indeed,’ said the Rat. ‘But I tell you, I’d take any trouble on earth for you, if only you’d be a sensible animal.’",say tell take trouble earth sensible animal 
57,"‘If I thought that, Ratty,’ murmured Toad, more feebly than ever, ‘then I would beg you--for the last time, probably--to step round to the village as quickly as possible--even now it may be too late--and fetch the doctor. But don’t you bother. It’s only a trouble, and perhaps we may as well let things take their course.’",think murmure beg last time step village possible late fetch doctor bother trouble let thing take course

59,"‘Surely you have noticed of late----’ murmured Toad. ‘But, no--why should you? Noticing things is only a trouble. To-morrow, indeed, you may be saying to yourself, “O, if only I had noticed sooner! If only I had done something!” But no; it’s a trouble. Never mind--forget that I asked.’",notice late murmure notice thing trouble say notice do trouble mind forget ask

Let’s talk about something else.’",look old man say begin get alarm course fetch doctor think want bad let talk else 
61,"‘I fear, dear friend,’ said Toad, with a sad smile, ‘that “talk” can do little in a case like this--or doctors either, for that matter; still, one must grasp at the slightest straw. And, by the way--while you are about it--I HATE to give you additional trouble, but I happen to remember that you will pass the door--would you mind at the same time asking the lawyer to step up? It would be a convenience to me, and there are moments--perhaps I should say there is A moment--when one must face disagreeable tasks, at whatever cost to exhausted nature!’",fear dear friend say sad smile talk do little case doctor matter grasp slight straw way hate give additional trouble happen remember pass door mind same time ask lawyer step convenience be moment say be moment face disagreeable task cost exhaust nature

63,"Outside, he stopped to consider. The other two were far away, and he had no one to consult.",stop consider other have consult 
64,"‘It’s best to be on the safe side,’ he said, on reflection. ‘I’ve known Toad fancy himself frightfully bad before, without the slightest reason; but I’ve never heard him ask for a lawyer! If there’s nothing really the matter, the doctor will tell him he’s an old ass, and cheer him up; and that will be something gained. I’d better humour him and go; it won’t take very long.’ So he ran off to the village on his errand of mercy.",good safe side say reflection know toad fancy bad slight reason hear ask lawyer be matter doctor tell old ass cheer gain humour go take run village errand mercy 
65,"The Toad, who had hopped lightly out of bed as soon as he heard the key turned in the lock, watched him eagerly from the window till he disappeared down the carriage-drive. Then, laughing heartily, he dressed as quickly as possible in the smartest suit he could lay hands on at the moment, filled his pockets with cash which he took from a small drawer in the dressing-table, and next, knotting the sheets from his bed together and tying one end of the improvised rope round the central mullion of the handsome Tudor window which formed such a feature of his bedroom, he scrambled out, slid lightly to the ground, and, taking the opposite direction to the Rat, marched off lightheartedly, whistling a merry tune.",hopp bed hear key turn lock watch window disappear carriage drive laugh dress possible smart suit lay hand moment fill pocket cash take small drawer dress table knot sheet bed tie end improvise rope central mullion handsome window form feature bedroom scramble slide ground take opposite direction march whistle merry tune 
66,"It was a gloomy luncheon for Rat when the Badger and the Mole at length returned, and he had to face them at table with his pitiful and unconvincing story. The Badger’s caustic, not to say brutal, remarks may be imagined, and therefore passed over; but it was painful to the Rat that even the Mole, though he took his friend’s side as far as possible, could not help saying, ‘You’ve been a bit of a duffer this time, Ratty! Toad, too, of all animals!’",gloomy luncheon length return have face table pitiful unconvincing story caustic say brutal remark imagine pass painful take friend side possible help say bit duffer time toad animal

He’s got clear away for the time, that’s certain; and the worst of it is, he’ll be so conceited with what he’ll think is his cleverness that he may commit any folly. One comfort is, we’re free now, and needn’t waste any more of our precious time doing sentry-go. But we’d better continue to sleep at Toad Hall for a while longer. Toad may be brought back at any moment--on a stretcher, or between two policemen.’",do rejoin talk mend matter get clear time certain bad conceited think cleverness commit folly comfort free waste more precious time do sentry go continue sleep while toad bring moment stretcher policemen

70," Meanwhile, Toad, gay and irresponsible, was walking briskly along the high road, some miles from home. At first he had taken by-paths, and crossed many fields, and changed his course several times, in case of pursuit; but now, feeling by this time safe from recapture, and the sun smiling brightly on him, and all Nature joining in a chorus of approval to the song of self-praise that his own heart was singing to him, he almost danced along the road in his satisfaction and conceit.",gay irresponsible walk high road mile home first take path cross many field change course several time case pursuit feel time safe recapture sun smile join chorus approval song self praise own heart sing dance road satisfaction conceit 
71,"‘Smart piece of work that!’ he remarked to himself chuckling. ‘Brain against brute force--and brain came out on the top--as it’s bound to do. Poor old Ratty! My! won’t he catch it when the Badger gets back! A worthy fellow, Ratty, with many good qualities, but very little intelligence and absolutely no education. I must take him in hand some day, and see if I can make something of him.’",smart piece work remark chuckle brain brute force brain come top bind do poor old ratty catch get worthy fellow many good quality little intelligence education take hand day see make 
72,"Filled full of conceited thoughts such as these he strode along, his head in the air, till he reached a little town, where the sign of ‘The Red Lion,’ swinging across the road halfway down the main street, reminded him that he had not breakfasted that day, and that he was exceedingly hungry after his long walk. He marched into the Inn, ordered the best luncheon that could be provided at so short a notice, and sat down to eat it in the coffee-room.",fill full conceited thought such strode head air reach little town sign red swing road main street remind breakfast day hungry long walk march order good luncheon provide short notice sit eat coffee room 
73,"He was about half-way through his meal when an only too familiar sound, approaching down the street, made him start and fall a-trembling all over. The poop-poop! drew nearer and nearer, the car could be heard to turn into the inn-yard and come to a stop, and Toad had to hold on to the leg of the table to conceal his over-mastering emotion. Presently the party entered the coffee-room, hungry, talkative, and gay, voluble on their experiences of the morning and the merits of the chariot that had brought them along so well. Toad listened eagerly, all ears, for a time; at last he could stand it no longer. He slipped out of the room quietly, paid his bill at the bar, and as soon as he got outside sauntered round quietly to the inn-yard. ‘There cannot be any harm,’ he said to himself, ‘in my only just LOOKING at it!’",half way meal only familiar sound approach street make start fall tremble poop poop draw car hear turn inn-yard come stop have hold leg table conceal over master emotion party enter coffee room hungry talkative gay voluble experience morning merit chariot bring listen ear time last stand slip room pay bill bar get saunter inn-yard be harm say lood

75,"‘I wonder,’ he said to himself presently, ‘I wonder if this sort of car STARTS easily?’",wonder say wonder sort car start 
76,"Next moment, hardly knowing how it came about, he found he had hold of the handle and was turning it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him, body and soul. As if in a dream he found himself, somehow, seated in the driver’s seat; as if in a dream, he pulled the lever and swung the car round the yard and out through the archway; and, as if in a dream, all sense of right and wrong, all fear of obvious consequences, seemed temporarily suspended. He increased his pace, and as the car devoured the street and leapt forth on the high road through the open country, he was only conscious that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and highest, Toad the terror, the traffic-queller, the Lord of the lone trail, before whom all must give way or be smitten into nothingness and everlasting night. He chanted as he flew, and the car responded with sonorous drone; the miles were eaten up under him as he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what might come to him.",next moment know come find have hold handle turn familiar sound break old passion seize master body soul dream find seat driver seat dream pull lever swing car yard archway dream sense right wrong fear obvious consequence seem suspend increase pace car devoure street leapt high road open country conscious good high terror traffic queller lone trail give way smite nothingness everlast night chant fly car respond sonorous drone mile eat spe know fulfil instinct live hour reckless come

78,"‘To my mind,’ observed the Chairman of the Bench of Magistrates cheerfully, ‘the ONLY difficulty that presents itself in this otherwise very clear case is, how we can possibly make it sufficiently hot for the incorrigible rogue and hardened ruffian whom we see cowering in the dock before us. Let me see: he has been found guilty, on the clearest evidence, first, of stealing a valuable motor-car; secondly, of driving to the public danger; and, thirdly, of gross impertinence to the rural police. Mr. Clerk, will you tell us, please, what is the very stiffest penalty we can impose for each of these offences? Without, of course, giving the prisoner the benefit of any doubt, because there isn’t any.’",mind observe only difficulty present clear case make hot incorrigible rogue harden ruffian see cower dock let see find guilty clearest evidence steal valuable motor car drive public danger gross impertinence rural police tell stiffest penalty impose offence course give prisoner benefit doubt be

But cheeking the police undoubtedly carries the severest penalty; and so it ought. Supposing you were to say twelve months for the theft, which is mild; and three years for the furious driving, which is lenient; and fifteen years for the cheek, which was pretty bad sort of cheek, judging by what we’ve heard from the witness-box, even if you only believe one-tenth part of what you heard, and I never believe more myself--those figures, if added together correctly, tot up to nineteen years----’",scratch nose pen person consider observe steal motor car bad offence cheek police carry severest penalty suppose say month theft mild year furious driving lenient year cheek bad sort cheek judge hear witness box believe tenth part hear believe more figure add year
