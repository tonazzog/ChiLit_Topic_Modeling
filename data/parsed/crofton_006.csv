1,CHAPTER 6. FIRST RAMBLE.,first ramble 
2,"Hugh's afternoon lessons were harder than those of the morning; and in the evening he found he had so much to do that there was very little time left for writing his letter home.  Some time there was, however; and Firth did not forget to rule his paper, and to let Hugh use his ink. Hugh had been accustomed to copy the prints he found in the Voyages and Travels he read; and he could never see a picture of a savage but he wanted to copy it.  He was thus accustomed to a pretty free use of his slate-pencil.  He now thought that it would save a great deal of description if he sent a picture or two in his letter: so he flourished off, on the first page, a sketch of Mr Tooke sitting at his desk at the top of the school, and of Mr Carnaby standing at his desk at the bottom of the school.",afternoon lesson hard morning evening find have much do be little time leave write letter home time be forget rule paper let use ink accustom copy print find read see picture savage want copy accustom free use slate pencil think save great deal description send picture letter flourish first page sketch sit desk top school stand desk bottom school 
3,"The next evening he made haste to fill up the sheet, for he found his business increasing upon his hands so fast that he did not know when he should get his letter off, if he did not despatch it at once.  He was just folding it up when Tom Holt observed that it was a pity not to put some words into the mouths of the figures, to make them more animated; and he showed Hugh, by the curious carvings of their desks, how to put words into the mouths of figures.  Hugh then remembered having seen this done in the caricatures in the print-shops in London; and he seized on the idea.  He put into Mr Tooke's mouth the words which were oftenest heard from him, ""Proceed, gentlemen;"" and into Mr Carnaby's, ""Hold your din.""",next evening make haste fill sheet find business increase hand know get letter despatch fold observe pity put word mouth figure make animated show curious carving desk put word mouth figure remember see do caricature print shop seize idea put mouth word hear proce gentleman hold din 
4,"Firth was too busy with his sense-verses to mind the little boys, as they giggled, with their heads close together, over Hugh's sheet of paper; but the usher was never too busy to be aware of any fun which might possibly concern his dignity.  He had his eye on the new boys the whole while.  He let Hugh direct his letter, and paint up a stroke or two which did not look so well as the rest; and it was not till Hugh was rolling the wafer about on his tongue that he interfered.  Mr Carnaby then came up, tapped Hugh's head, told him not to get on so fast, for that every letter must be looked over before it went to the post.  While saying this, he took the letter, and put it into his waistcoat pocket. In vain Hugh begged to have it again, saying he would write another. The more he begged, and the more dismayed Tom Holt looked, the less Mr Carnaby would attend to either.  Firth let himself be interrupted to hear the case: but he could do nothing in it.  It was a general rule, which he thought every boy had known; and it was too late now to prevent the letter being looked over.",busy sense verse mind little boy giggle head sheet paper usher busy aware fun concern dignity have eye new boy whole while let direct letter paint stroke look rest roll wafer tongue interfer come tap head tell get letter look go post say take letter put waistcoat pocket vain begg have say write more begg dismay look less attend let interrupt hear case do general rule think boy know late prevent letter look 
5,"Mr Carnaby was so angry at the liberty Hugh had taken with his face and figure, that, in spite of all prayers, and a good many tears, he walked up the school with the letter, followed by poor Hugh, as soon as Mr Tooke had taken his seat next morning.  Hugh thought that Holt, who had put him up to the most offensive part of the pictures, might have borne him company; but Holt was a timid boy, and he really had not courage to leave his seat.  So Hugh stood alone, awaiting Mr Tooke's awful words, while the whole of the first class looked up from their books, in expectation of what was to happen.  They waited some time for the master's words; for he was trying to help laughing.  He and Mr Carnaby were so much alike in the pictures, and both so like South Sea islanders, that it was impossible to help laughing at the thought of this sketch going abroad as a representation of the Crofton masters.  At last all parties laughed aloud, and Mr Tooke handed Hugh his wafer-glass, and bade him wafer up his letter, and by all means send it. Mr Carnaby could not remain offended if his principal was not angry: so here the matter ended, except that Hugh made some strong resolutions about his future letters, and that the corners of the master's mouth were seen to be out of their usual order several times in the course of the morning.",angry liberty take face figure spite prayer good many tear walk school letter follow poor take seat next morning think put offensive part picture borne company timid boy have courage leave seat stand await awful word whole first class look book expectation happen wait time master word try help laugh alike picture islander impossible help laugh thought sketch go representation master last party laugh hand wafer glass bid wafer letter means send remain offend principal angry matter end make strong resolution future letter corner master mouth see usual order several time course morning 
6,"This incident, and everything which haunted Hugh's mind, and engrossed his attention, was a serious evil to him; for his business soon grew to be more than his habit of mind was equal to.  In a few days, he learned to envy the boys (and they were almost the whole school) who could fix their attention completely and immediately on the work before them, and relax as completely, when it was accomplished.  When his eyes were wandering, they observed boy after boy frowning over his dictionary, or repeating to himself, earnestly and without pause; and presently the business was done, and the learner at ease, feeling confident that he was ready to meet his master.  After double the time had passed Hugh was still trying to get the meaning of his lesson into his head--going over the same words a dozen times, without gaining any notion of their meaning--suffering, in short from his long habit of inattention at home. He did now try hard; but he seemed to get only headaches for his pains. His brother saw enough to make him very sorry for Hugh before ten days were over.  He might not, perhaps, have been struck with his anxious countenance, his frequent starts, and his laying his head down on his desk because it ached so, if it had not been for what happened at night. Sometimes Hugh started out of bed, and began to dress, when the elder boys went up with their light, only an hour after the younger ones. Sometimes he would begin saying his syntax in the middle of the night, fancying he was standing before Mr Carnaby; and once he walked in his sleep as far as the head of the stairs, and then suddenly woke, and could not make out where he was.  Phil should have told Mr Tooke of these things; but Hugh was so very anxious that nobody should know of his ""tricks"" (as the boys in his room called his troubles), that Phil only mentioned the matter to Mrs Watson, who had known so many bad sleepers among little boys, and had so little idea that the habit was anything new, that she took scarcely any notice of it.  She had his hair cut very short and close, and saw that he took a moderate supper, and was satisfied that all would be well.  Hugh did not part with his hair till he had joked himself about its length as much as any one could quiz him for it.  When he had pulled it down over the end of his nose, and peeped through it, like an owl out of an ivy-bush, he might be supposed to part with it voluntarily, and not because he was laughed at.",incident haunt mind engross attention serious evil business grow more habit mind equal few day learn envy boy whole school fix attention work relax accomplish eye wonder observe boy boy frown dictionary repeat pause business do learner ease feel confident ready meet master double time pass try get meaning lesson head go same word time gain notion meaning suffer short long habit inattention home try seem get headache pain brother see make sorry day strike anxious countenance frequent start lay head desk ach happen night start bed begin dress elder boy go light hour young one begin say syntax middle night fancy stand walk sleep head stair wake make tell thing anxious know trick boy room call trouble mention matter know many bad sleeper little boy have little idea habit new take notice have hair cut short close see take moderate supper satisfied well part hair joke length one quiz pull end nose peep owl ivy bush suppose part laugh 
7,"Phil's observation of his brother's toil and trouble led him to give him some help.  Almost every day he would hear Hugh say his lesson--or try to say it; for the poor boy seldom succeeded.  Phil sometimes called him stupid, and sometimes refrained from saying so, whatever he might think; but there really was very little difference in the result, whether Phil heard the lessons beforehand or not; and it gave Joe Cape a great advantage over Phil that he had no little brother to attend to. Considering how selfish rivalship is apt to make boys (and even men), it was perhaps no wonder that Phil sometimes kept out of Hugh's way at the right hour, saying to himself that his proper business was to do his lessons, and get or keep ahead of Joe Cape; and that Hugh must take his chance, and work his own way, as other boys had to do.  This conduct might not be wondered at in Phil; but it hurt Hugh, and made him do his lessons all the worse.  He did not like to expose his brother's unkindness to any one, or he would oftener have asked Firth to help him. Firth, too, had plenty of work of his own to do.  More than once, however, Firth met the little lad, wandering about, with his grammar in his hand, in search of the hidden Phil; and then Firth would stop him, and sit down with him, and have patience, and give him such clear explanations, such good examples of the rules he was to learn, that it all became easy, and Hugh found his lessons were to him only what those of other boys seemed to them.  Still, however, and at the best, Hugh was, as a learner, far too much at the mercy of circumstances--the victim of what passed before his eyes, or was said within his hearing.",observation brother toil trouble lead give help day hear say lesson try say poor boy succeed call stupid refrain say think be little difference result hear lesson give great advantage have little brother attend consider selfish rivalship apt make boy man wonder keep way right hour say proper business do lesson get keep take chance work own way other boy have do conduct wonder hurt make do lesson bad like expose brother unkindness one ask help have plenty work own do more meet little lad wonder grammar hand search hide stop sit have patience give such clear explanation such good example rule learn become easy find lesson other boy seem good learner much mercy circumstance victim pass eye say hearing 
8,"Boys who find difficulty in attending to their lessons are sure to be more teased with interruptions than any others.  Holt had not the habit of learning; and he and Hugh were continually annoyed by the boys who sat near them watching how they got on, and making remarks upon them. One day, Mr Tooke was called out of the school-room to a visitor, and Mr Carnaby went up to take the master's place, and hear his class. This was too good an opportunity for the boys below to let slip; and they began to play tricks,--most of them directed against Hugh and Tom Holt.  One boy, Warner, began to make the face that always made Holt laugh, however he tried to be grave.  Page drew a caricature of Mrs Watson on his slate, and held it up; and Davison took a mask out of his desk, and even ventured to tie it on, as if it had not been school-time.",boy find difficulty attend lesson sure tease interruption other have habit learn annoy boy sit watch get make remark day call school room visitor go take master place hear class good opportunity boy let slip begin play trick most direct boy begin make face make laugh try grave draw caricature slate hold take mask desk venture tie school time

10,"""'Tis a shame!"" said Tom Holt, sighing for breath after his struggle not to laugh.  ""We shall never be ready.""",tis shame say sigh breath struggle laugh ready 
11,"Hugh made gestures of indignation at the boys, which only caused worse faces to be made, and the mask to nod.",make gesture indignation boy cause bad face make mask nod 
12,"""We wont look at them,"" proposed Holt.  ""Let us cover our eyes, and not look up at all.""",look propose let cover eye look 
13,"Hugh put his hands before his eyes; but still his mind's eye saw the grinning mask, and his lesson did not get on.  Besides, a piece of wet sponge lighted on the very page he was learning from.  He looked up fiercely, to see who had thrown it.  It was no other than Tooke, who belonged to that class:--it was Tooke, to judge by his giggle, and his pretending to hide his face, as if ashamed.  Hugh tossed back the sponge, so as to hit Tooke on the nose.  Then Tooke was angry, and threw it again, and the sponge passed backwards and forwards several times: for Hugh was by this time very angry,--boiling with indignation at the hardship of not being able to learn his lesson, when he really would if he could.  While the sponge was still passing to and fro, Mr Carnaby's voice was heard from the far end of the room, desiring Warner, Page, Davison, and Tooke to be quiet, and let the boys alone till Mr Tooke came in, when Mr Tooke would take his own measures.",put hand eye mind eye see grinn mask lesson get piece wet sponge light very page learn look see throw other belong class judge giggle pretend hide face ashamed toss sponge hit nose angry throw sponge pass forward several time time angry boil indignation hardship able learn lesson sponge pass for voice hear far end room desire quiet let boy alone come take own measure 
14,"Hugh, wondering how Mr Carnaby knew, at that distance, what was going on, found that Holt was no longer by his side.  In a moment, Holt returned to his seat, flushed and out of breath.  A very slight hiss was heard from every form near, as he came down the room.",wonder know distance go find side moment return seat flush breath slight hiss hear form come room 
15,"""O!  Holt!  You have been telling tales!"" cried Hugh.",tell tale cry

20,"""I meant no harm,"" said Holt, trembling.  ""Was not it a shame that they would not let us learn our lessons?""",mean harm say tremble shame let learn lesson 
21,"""Yes, it was--but--""",
22,"At this moment Mr Tooke entered the room.  As he passed the forms, the boys were all bent over their books, as if they could think of nothing else.  Mr Tooke walked up the room to his desk, and Mr Carnaby walked down the room to _his_ desk; and then Mr Carnaby said, quite aloud,--",moment enter room pass form boy bend book think else walk room desk walk room desk say 
23,"""Mr Tooke, sir.""",sir 
24,"""Well.""",
25,"Here Holt sprang from his desk, and ran to the usher, and besought him not to say a word about what Warner's class had been doing.  He even hung on Mr Carnaby's arm in entreaty; but Mr Carnaby shook him off, and commanded him back to his seat.  Then the whole school heard Mr Tooke told about the wry faces and the mask, and the trouble of the little boys.  Mr Tooke was not often angry; but when he was, his face grew white, and his lips trembled.  His face was white now.  He stood up, and called before him the little boy who had informed.  Hugh chose to go with Holt, though Holt had not gone up with him about the letter, the other day; and Holt felt how kind this was.  Mr Tooke desired to know who the offenders were; and as they were named, he called to them to stand up in their places.  Then came the sentence.  Mr Tooke would never forgive advantage being taken of his absence.  If there were boys who could not be trusted while his back was turned, they must be made to remember him when he was out of sight, by punishment.  Page must remain in school after hours, to learn twenty lines of Virgil; Davison twenty; Tooke forty--",spring desk run usher besig say word class do hang arm entreaty shake command seat whole school hear tell wry face mask trouble little boy angry face grow white lip tremble face white stand call little boy inform choose go go letter other day feel kind desire know offender name call stand place come sentence forgive advantage take absence be boy trust back turn make remember sight punishment page remain school hour learn line take

29,"""And Warner,"" continued the master, as if he had not heard the interruption, ""considering that Warner has got off too easily for many pranks of late,--Warner seventy.""",continue master hear interruption consider get many prank late 
30,"Seventy!  The idea of having anybody condemned, through him, to learn seventy lines of Latin by heart, made Holt so miserable that the word seventy seemed really to prick his very ears.  Though Mr Tooke's face was still white, Holt ventured up to him, ""Pray, sir--""",idea have condemn learn line heart make miserable word seem prick very ear face white venture pray

36,"""I have nothing to do with that.  That is your affair,"" said the master, sending the boys back to their seats.",have do affair say master send boy seat 
37,"Poor Holt had cause to rue this morning, for long after.  He was weary of the sound of hissing, and of the name ""tell-tale;"" and the very boys who had prompted him to go up were at first silent, and then joined against him.  He complained to Hugh of the difficulty of knowing what it was right to do.  He had been angry on Hugh's account chiefly; and he still thought it _was_ very unjust to hinder their lessons, when they wished not to be idle: and yet they were all treating him as if he had done something worse than the boys with the mask.  Hugh thought all this was true: but he believed it was settled among schoolboys (though Holt had never had the opportunity of knowing it) that it was a braver thing for boys to bear any teasing from one another than to call in the power of the master to help.  A boy who did that was supposed not to be able to take care of himself; and for this he was despised, besides being disliked, for having brought punishment upon his companions.",poor have rue morning weary sound hissing name tell tale very boy prompt go first silent join complain difficulty know right do angry account think unjust hinder lesson wish idle treat do bad boy mask think true believe settle schoolboy have opportunity know brave thing boy bear teasing call power master help boy do suppose able take care despise dislike bring punishment companion

39,"""You had better say so,"" advised Hugh; ""and then they will see that you had never been at school, and did not know how to manage.""",good say advise see school know manage 
40,"The first Saturday had been partly dreaded, and partly longed for, by Hugh.  He had longed for the afternoon's ramble; but Saturday morning was the time for saying tables, among other things.  Nothing happened as he had expected.  The afternoon was so rainy that there was no going out; and, as for the tables, he was in a class of five; and ""four times seven"" did not come to him in regular course.  Eight times seven did, and he said ""fifty-six"" with great satisfaction, Mr Carnaby asked him afterwards the dreaded question, but he was on his guard; and as he answered it right, and the usher had not found out the joke, he hoped he should hear no more of the matter.",first dread long long afternoon ramble morning time say table other thing happen expect afternoon rainy be go table class time come regular course time say great satisfaction ask dread question guard answer usher find joke hope hear more matter 
41,"The next Saturday was fine, and at last he was to have the walk he longed for.  The weekly repetitions were over, dinner was done, Mr Carnaby appeared with his hat on, the whole throng burst into the open air, and out of bounds, and the new boys were wild with expectation and delight.  When they had passed the churchyard and the green, and were wading through the sandy road which led up to the heath, Firth saw Hugh running and leaping hither and thither, not knowing what to do with his spirits.  Firth called him, and putting his arm round Hugh's neck, so as to keep him prisoner, said he did not know how he might want his strength before he got home, and he had better not spend it on a bit of sandy road.  So Hugh was made to walk quietly, and gained his breath before the breezy heath was reached.",next fine last have walk long weekly repetition dinner do appear hat whole throng burst open air bound new boy wild expectation delight pass churchyard green wading sandy road lead heath see run leap know do spirit call put arm neck keep prisoner say know want strength get spend bit sandy road make walk gain breath breezy heath reach 
42,"On the way, he saw that a boy of the name of Dale, whom he had never particularly observed before, was a good deal teased by some boys who kept crossing their hands before them, and curtseying like girls, talking in a mincing way, and calling one another Amelia, with great affectation.  Dale tried to get away, but he was followed, whichever way he turned.",way see boy name observe good deal tease boy keep cross hand curtsey girl talk mincing way call great affectation try get follow way turn

45,"""What a shame!"" cried Hugh; words which he had used very often already since he came to Crofton.",shame cry word use come

56,"Then the two boys wandered off among the furze bushes, talking about their homes; and in a little while they had so opened their hearts to each other, that they felt as if they had always been friends.  Nobody thought any more about them when once the whole school was dispersed over the heath.  Some boys made for a hazel copse, some way beyond the heath, in hopes of finding a few nuts already ripe.  Others had boats to float on the pond.  A large number played leap-frog, and some ran races. Mr Carnaby threw himself down on a soft couch of wild thyme, on a rising ground, and took out his book.  So Dale and Hugh felt themselves unobserved, and they chatted away at a great rate.  Not but that an interruption or two did occur.  They fell in with a flock of geese, and Hugh did not much like their appearance, never having heard a goose make a noise before.  He had eaten roast goose, and he had seen geese in the feathers at the poulterers'; but he had never seen them alive, and stretching their necks at passengers.  He flinched at the first moment. Dale, who never imagined that a boy who was not afraid of his schoolfellows could be afraid of geese, luckily mistook the movement, and said, ""Ay, get a switch,--a bunch of furze will do, and we will be rid of the noisy things.""",boy wander furze bush talk home little open heart other feel friend think more whole school disperse heath boy make hazel copse heath hope find few nut ripe other have boat float pond large number play leap frog run race throw soft couch wild thyme rise ground take book feel unobserve chate great rate interruption occur fall flock geese like appearance hear goose make noise eat roast goose see geese feather poulterer see alive stretch neck passenger flinch first moment imagine boy afraid schoolfellow afraid geese mistake movement say get switch bunch furze do rid noisy thing

58,"They soon came upon some creatures which were larger and stronger, and with which Hugh was no better acquainted.  Some cows were grazing, or had been grazing, till a party of boys came up.  They were now restless, moving uneasily about, so that Dale himself hesitated for a moment which way to go.  Lamb was near,--the passionate boy, who was nobody's friend, and who was therefore seldom at play with others.  He was also something of a coward, as any one might know from his frequent bullying.  He and Holt happened to be together at this time; and it was their appearance of fright at the restless cows which frightened Hugh.  One cow at last began to trot towards them at a pretty good rate.  Lamb ran off to the right, and the two little boys after him, though Dale pulled at Hugh's hand to make him stand still, as Dale chose to do himself.  He pulled in vain--Hugh burst away, and off went the three boys, over the hillocks and through the furze, the cow trotting at some distance behind.  They did not pause till Lamb had led them off the heath into a deep lane, different from the one by which they had come.  The cow stopped at a patch of green grass, just at the entrance of the hollow way; and the runners therefore could take breath.",come creature large strong acquainted cow graze graze party boy come restless move hesitate moment way go passionate boy friend seldom play other coward one know frequent bullying happen time appearance fright restless cow frighten cow last begin trot good rate run right little boy pull hand make stand choose do pull vain burst go boy hillock furze cow trot distance pause lead heath deep lane different one come cow stop patch green grass entrance hollow way runner take breath

60,"""And so am I,"" declared Holt, smacking his dry tongue.  Hugh's mouth was very dry too, between the run and the fright.",declare smack dry tongue mouth dry run fright 
61,"""Well, then, come along with me, and I will show you,"" said Lamb.",come show say 
62,"Hugh thought they ought not to go farther from the heath: but Lamb said they would get back by another way,--through a gate belonging to a friend of his.  They could not get back the way they came, because the cow was there still.  He walked briskly on till they came to a cottage, over whose door swung a sign; and on the sign was a painting of a bottle and a glass, and a heap of things which were probably meant for cakes, as there were cakes in the window.  Here Lamb turned in, and the woman seemed to know him well.  She smiled, and closed the door behind the three boys, and asked them to sit down: but Lamb said there was no time for that to-day,--she must be quick.  He then told the boys that they would have some ginger-beer.",think go heath say get way gate belong friend get way come cow walk come cottage door swing sign sign painting bottle glass heap thing mean cake be cake window turn woman seem know smile close door boy ask sit say be time day quick tell boy have ginger beer

65,"The woman declared that it was the most wholesome thing in the world; and if the young gentleman did not find it so, she would never ask him to taste her ginger-beer again.  Hugh thanked them both; but he did not feel quite comfortable.  He looked at Holt, to find out what he thought: but Holt was quite engrossed with watching the woman untwisting the wire of the first bottle.  The cork did not fly; indeed there was some difficulty in getting it out: so Lamb waived his right, as the eldest, to drink first; and the little boys were so long in settling which should have it, that the little spirit there was had all gone off before Hugh began to drink; and he did not find ginger-beer such particularly good stuff as Lamb had said.  He would have liked a drink of water better.  The next bottle was very brisk: so Lamb seized upon it; and the froth hung round his mouth when he had done: but Holt was no better off with his than Hugh had been.  They were both urged to try their luck again.  Hugh would not: but Holt did once; and Lamb, two or three times. Then the woman offered them some cakes upon a plate: and the little boys thanked her, and took each one.  Lamb put some in his pocket, and advised the others to do the same, as they had no time to spare.  He kept some room in his pocket, however, for some plums; and told the boys that they might carry theirs in their handkerchiefs, or in their caps, if they would take care to have finished before they came within sight of the usher.  He then asked the woman to let them out upon the heath through her garden gate; and she said she certainly would when they had paid.  She then stood drumming with her fingers upon the table, and looking through the window, as if waiting.",woman declare wholesome thing world young gentleman find ask taste ginger beer thank feel comfortable look find think engrossed watch woman untwist wire first bottle cork fly be difficulty get waive right old drink little boy long settle have little spirit go begin drink find ginger beer such good stuff say like drink water good next bottle brisk seize froth hang mouth do good urge try luck time woman offer cake plate little boy thank take one put pocket advise other do same have time spare keep room pocket plum tell boy carry handkerchief cap take care finish come sight usher ask woman let heath garden gate say pay stand drum finger table look window wait

69,"Holt had nothing with him either.  Lamb asked the woman what there was to pay.  She seemed to count and consider; and Holt told Hugh afterwards that he saw Lamb wink at her.  She then said that the younger gentlemen had had the most plums and cakes.  The charge was a shilling a piece for them, and sixpence for Master Lamb:--half-a-crown exactly.  Hugh protested he never meant anything like this, and that he wanted part of his half-crown to buy a comb with; and he would have emptied out the cakes and fruit he had left; but the woman stopped him, saying that she never took back what she had sold.  Lamb hurried him, too, declaring that their time was up; and he even thrust his finger and thumb into Hugh's inner pocket, and took out the half-crown, which he gave to the woman.  He was sure that Hugh could wait for his comb till Holt paid him, and the woman said she did not see that any more combing was wanted: the young gentleman's hair looked so pretty as it was.  She then showed them through the garden, and gave them each a marigold full-blown.  She unlocked her gate, pushed them through, locked it behind them, and left them to hide their purchases as well as they could.  Though the little boys stuffed their pockets till the ripest plums burst, and wetted the linings, they could not dispose of them all; and they were obliged to give away a good many.",have ask woman be pay seem count consider tell see wink say young gentleman have most plum cake charge shilling piece half crown protest mean want part half crown buy comb empty cake fruit leave woman stop say take sell hurry declare time thrust finger thumb inner pocket take half crown give woman sure wait comb pay woman say see more combing want young gentleman hair look pretty show garden give marigold full blow unlock gate push lock leave hide purchase little boy stuff pocket ripest plum burst wett lining dispose oblige give good many 
70,"Hugh went in search of his new friend, and drew him aside from the rest to relate his trouble.  Dale wondered he had not found out Lamb before this, enough to refuse to follow his lead.  Lamb would never pay a penny.

77,"Hugh did not at all succeed in his endeavours to forget his adventure. The more he thought about it, the worse it seemed; and the next time he spoke to Holt, and told him to remember that he owed him a shilling, Holt said he did not know that,--he did not mean to spend a shilling; and it was clear that it was only his fear of Hugh's speaking to Mrs Watson or the usher, that prevented his saying outright that he should not pay it.  Hugh felt very hot, and bit his lip to make his voice steady when he told Dale, on the way home, that he did not believe he should ever see any part of his half-crown again.  Dale thought so too; but he advised him to do nothing more than keep the two debtors up to the remembrance of their debt.  If he told so powerful a person as Firth, it would be almost as much tale-telling as if he went to the master at once; and Hugh himself had no inclination to expose his folly to Phil, who was already quite sufficiently ashamed of his inexperience. So poor Hugh threw the last of his plums to some cottager's children on the green, in his way home; and, when he set foot within bounds again, he heartily wished that this Saturday afternoon had been rainy too; for any disappointment would have been better than this scrape.",succeed endeavour forget adventure more think bad seem next time speak tell remember owe shilling say know mean spend shilling clear fear speak usher prevent say pay feel hot bite lip make voice tell way believe see part half crown think advise do more keep debtor remembrance debt tell powerful person much tale tell go master have inclination expose folly ashamed inexperience poor throw last plum cottager child green way set foot bound wish afternoon rainy disappointment good scrape 
78,"While learning his lessons for Monday, he forgot the whole matter; and then he grew merry over the great Saturday night's washing; but after he was in bed, it flashed upon him that he should meet uncle and aunt Shaw in church to-morrow, and they would speak to Phil and him after church; and his uncle might ask after the half-crown.  He determined not to expose his companions, at any rate: but his uncle would be displeased; and this thought was so sad that Hugh cried himself to sleep.  His uncle and aunt were at church the next morning; and Hugh could not forget the ginger-beer, or help watching his uncle: so that, though he tried several times to attend to the sermon; he knew nothing about it when it was done.  His uncle observed in the churchyard that they must have had a fine ramble the day before; but did not say anything about pocket-money.  Neither did he name a day for his nephews to visit him, though he said they must come before the days grew much shorter.  So Hugh thought he had got off very well thus far.  In the afternoon, however, Mrs Watson, who invited him and Holt into her parlour, to look over the pictures in her great Bible, was rather surprised to find how little Hugh could tell her of the sermon, considering how much he had remembered the Sunday before.  She had certainly thought that to-day's sermon had been the simpler, and the more interesting to young people, of the two.  Her conversation with Hugh did him good, however.  It reminded him of his mother's words, and of her expectations from him; and it made him resolve to bear, not only his loss, but any blame which might come upon him silently, and without betraying anybody.  He had already determined, fifty times within the twenty-four hours, never to be so weakly led again, when his own mind was doubtful, as he had felt it all the time from leaving the heath to getting back to it again.  He began to reckon on the Christmas holidays, when he should have five weeks at home, free from the evils of both places,--from lessons with Miss Harold, and from Crofton scrapes.",learn lesson forget whole matter grow merry great night washing bed flash meet uncle aunt church speak church uncle ask half crown determine expose companion rate uncle displease thought sad cry sleep uncle aunt church next morning forget ginger beer help watch uncle try several time attend sermon know do uncle observe churchyard have fine ramble day say pocket money name day nephew visit say come day grow short think get afternoon invite parlour look picture great surprised find little tell sermon consider much remember think day sermon simple interesting young person conversation do good remind mother word expectation make resolve bear loss blame come betray determine time hour lead own mind doubtful feel time leave heath get begin reckon holiday have week home free evil place lesson scrape 
79,"It is probable that the whole affair would have passed over quietly, and the woman in the lane might have made large profits by other inexperienced boys, and Mr Carnaby might have gone on being careless as to where the boys went out of his sight on Saturdays, but that Tom Holt ate too many plums on the present occasion.  On Sunday morning he was not well; and was so ill by the evening, and all Monday, that he had to be regularly nursed; and when he left his bed, he was taken to Mrs Watson's parlour,--the comfortable, quiet place where invalid boys enjoyed themselves.  Poor Holt was in very low spirits; and Mrs Watson was so kind that he could not help telling her that he owed a shilling, and he did not know how he should ever pay it; and that Hugh Proctor, who had been his friend till now, seemed on a sudden much more fond of Dale; and this made it harder to be in debt to him.",probable whole affair pass woman lane make large profit other inexperienced boy go careless boy go sight eat many plum present occasion morning ill evening have nurse leave bed take parlour comfortable quiet place invalid boy enjoy poor low spirit kind help tell owe shilling know pay friend seem sudden fond make hard debt 
80,"The wet, smeared lining of the pockets had told Mrs Watson already that there had been some improper indulgence in good things; and when she heard what part Lamb had played towards the little boys, she thought it right to tell Mr Tooke.  Mr Tooke said nothing till Holt was in the school again, which was on Thursday; and not then till the little boys had said their lessons, at past eleven o'clock.  They were drawing on their slates, and Lamb was still mumbling over his book, without getting on, when the master's awful voice was heard, calling up before him Lamb, little Proctor, and Holt.  All three started, and turned red; so that the school concluded them guilty before it was known what they were charged with.  Dale knew,--and he alone; and very sorry he was, for the intimacy between Hugh and him had grown very close indeed since Saturday.",wet smear lining pocket tell be improper indulgence good thing hear part play little boy think right tell say school little boy say lesson past o'clock draw slate mumble book get master awful voice hear call little start turn red school conclude guilty know charge know sorry intimacy grow close 
81,"The master was considerate towards the younger boys.  He made Lamb tell the whole.  Even when the cowardly lad ""bellowed"" (as his school-fellows called his usual mode of crying) so that nothing else could be heard, Mr Tooke waited, rather than question the other two.  When the whole story was extracted, in all its shamefulness, from Lamb's own lips, the master expressed his disgust.  He said nothing about the money part of it--about how Hugh was to be paid.  He probably thought it best for the boys to take the consequences of their folly in losing their money.  He handed the little boys over to Mr Carnaby to be caned--""To make them remember,"" as he said; though they themselves were pretty sure they should never forget.  Lamb was kept to be punished by the master himself.  Though Lamb knew he should be severely flogged, and though he was the most cowardly boy in the school, he did not suffer so much as Hugh did in the prospect of being caned--being punished at all.  Phil, who knew his brother's face well, saw, as he passed down the room, how miserable he was--too miserable to cry; and Phil pulled him by the sleeve, and whispered that being caned was nothing to mind--only a stroke or two across the shoulders.  Hugh shook his head, as much as to say, ""It is not that.""",master considerate young boy make tell whole cowardly lad bellow school fellow call usual mode cry else hear wait question other whole story extract shamefulness own lip master express disgust say money part pay think good boy take consequence folly lose money hand little boy cane make remember say sure forget keep punish master know flogge cowardly boy school suffer much prospect cane punish know brother face see pass room miserable miserable cry pull sleeve whisper cane mind stroke shoulder shake head say 
82,"No--it was not the pain.  It was the being punished in open school, and when he did not feel that he deserved it.  How should he know where Lamb was taking him?  How should he know that the ginger-beer was to be paid for, and that he was to pay?  He felt himself injured enough already: and now to be punished in addition!  He would have died on the spot for liberty to tell Mr Tooke and everybody what he thought of the way he was treated.  He had felt his mother hard sometimes; but what had she ever done to him compared with this?  It was well he thought of his mother.  At the first moment, the picture of home in his mind nearly made him cry--the thing of all others he most wished to avoid while so many eyes were on him; but the remembrance of what his mother expected of him--her look when she told him _he must not fail_, gave him courage. Hard as it was to be, as he believed, unjustly punished, it was better than having done anything very wrong--anything that he really could not have told his mother.",pain punish open school feel deserve know take know ginger beer pay pay feel injure punish addition die spot liberty tell think way treat feel mother do compare think mother first moment picture home mind make cry thing other wish avoid many eye remembrance mother expect look tell fail_ give courage hard believe punish good do wrong tell mother 
83,"Mr Carnaby foresaw that a rebuke was in store for him for his negligence during the walk on Saturday; and this anticipation did not sweeten his mood.  He kept the little boys waiting, though Holt was trembling very much, and still weak from his illness.  It occurred to the usher that another person might be made uncomfortable; and he immediately acted on the idea.  He had observed how fond of one another Dale and Hugh had become; and he thought he would plague Dale a little.
