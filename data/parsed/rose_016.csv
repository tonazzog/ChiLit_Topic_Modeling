1,CHAPTER XV. WE RETURN TO ROSALBA,return 
2,"King Padella made very similar proposals to Rosalba to those which she had received from the various princes who, as we have seen, had fallen in love with her. His Majesty was a widower, and offered to marry his fair captive that instant, but she declined his invitation in her usual polite gentle manner, stating that Prince Giglio was her love, and that any other union was out of the question. Having tried tears and supplications in vain, this violent-tempered monarch menaced her with threats and tortures; but she declared she would rather suffer all these than accept the hand of her father’s murderer, who left her finally, uttering the most awful imprecations, and bidding her prepare for death on the following morning.",make similar proposal receive various prince see fall love widower offer marry fair captive instant decline invitation usual polite gentle manner state love other union question try tear supplication vain violent temper monarch menace threat torture declare suffer accept hand father murderer leave utter awful imprecation bid prepare death follow morning 
3,"All night long the King spent in advising how he should get rid of this obdurate young creature. Cutting off her head was much too easy a death for her; hanging was so common in His Majesty’s dominions that it no longer afforded him any sport; finally, he bethought himself of a pair of fierce lions which had lately been sent to him as presents, and he determined, with these ferocious brutes, to hunt poor Rosalba down. Adjoining his castle was an amphitheatre where the Prince indulged in bull-baiting, rat-hunting, and other ferocious sports. The two lions were kept in a cage under this place; their roaring might be heard over the whole city, the inhabitants of which, I am sorry to say, thronged in numbers to see a poor young lady gobbled up by two wild beasts.",night spend advise get rid obdurate young creature cut head easy death hanging common dominion afford sport bethough pair fierce lion send present determine ferocious brute hunt poor adjoin castle amphitheatre indulge bull baiting rat hunting other ferocious sport lion keep cage place roaring hear whole city inhabitant sorry say throng number see poor young lady gobble wild beast 
4,"The King took his place in the royal box, having the officers of his Court around and the Count Hogginarmo by his side, upon whom His Majesty was observed to look very fiercely; the fact is, royal spies had told the monarch of Hogginarmo’s behaviour, his proposals to Rosalba, and his offer to fight for the crown. Black as thunder looked King Padella at this proud noble, as they sat in the front seats of the theatre waiting to see the tragedy whereof poor Rosalba was to be the heroine.",take place royal box have officer side observe look fact royal spy tell monarch behaviour proposal offer fight crown thunder look proud noble sit front seat theatre wait see tragedy poor heroine 
5,"At length that Princess was brought out in her nightgown, with all her beautiful hair falling down her back, and looking so pretty that even the beef-eaters and keepers of the wild animals wept plentifully at seeing her. And she walked with her poor little feet (only luckily the arena was covered with sawdust), and went and leaned up against a great stone in the centre of the amphitheatre, round which the Court and the people were seated in boxes, with bars before them, for fear of the great, fierce, red-maned, black-throated, long-tailed, roaring, bellowing, rushing lions. And now the gates were opened, and with a wurrawarrurawarar two great lean, hungry, roaring lions rushed out of their den, where they had been kept for three weeks on nothing but a little toast-and-water, and dashed straight up to the stone where poor Rosalba was waiting. Commend her to your patron saints, all you kind people, for she is in a dreadful state!",length bring nightgown beautiful hair fall back look pretty beef eater keeper wild animal goot see walk poor little foot arena cover sawdust go learn great stone centre amphitheatre person seat box bar fear great fierce red mane black throated long tail roar bellow rush lion gate open wurrawarrurawarar great lean hungry roar lion rush dan keep week little toast water dash stone poor wait commend patron saint kind person dreadful state 
6,"There was a hum and a buzz all through the circus, and the fierce King Padella even felt a little compassion. But Count Hogginarmo, seated by His Majesty, roared out ‘Hurray! Now for it! Soo-soo-soo!’ that nobleman being uncommonly angry still at Rosalba’s refusal of him.",be hum buzz circus fierce feel little compassion seat roar nobleman angry refusal 
7,"But O strange event! O remarkable circumstance! O extraordinary coincidence, which I am sure none of you could BY ANY POSSIBILITY have divined! When the lions came to Rosalba, instead of devouring her with their great teeth, it was with kisses they gobbled her up! They licked her pretty feet, they nuzzled their noses in her lap, they moo’d, they seemed to say, ‘Dear, dear sister don’t you recollect your brothers in the forest?’ And she put her pretty white arms round their tawny necks, and kissed them.",strange event remarkable circumstance extraordinary coincidence sure by possibility divine lion come devour great tooth kisse gobble lick pretty foot nuzzle nose lap seem say dear dear sister recollect brother forest put pretty white arm tawny neck kiss 
8,King Padella was immensely astonished. The Count Hogginarmo was extremely disgusted. ‘Pooh!’ the Count cried. ‘Gammon!’ exclaimed his Lordship.’ These lions are tame beasts come from Wombwell’s or Astley’s. It is a shame to put people off in this way. I believe they are little boys dressed up in door-mats. They are no lions at all.’,astonished disgusted count cry exclaim lion tame beast come shame put person way believe little boy dress door mat lion 
9,"‘Ha!’ said the King, ‘you dare to say “gammon” to your Sovereign, do you? These lions are no lions at all, aren’t they? Ho! my beef-eaters! Ho! my bodyguard! Take this Count Hogginarmo and fling him into the circus! Give him a sword and buckler, let him keep his armour on, and his weather-eye out, and fight these lions.’",say dare say gammon lion lion beef eater bodyguard take fling circus give sword buckler let keep armour weather eye fight lion 
10,"The haughty Hogginarmo laid down his opera-glass, and looked scowling round at the King and his attendants. ‘Touch me not, dogs!’ he said, ‘or by St. Nicholas the Elder, I will gore you! Your Majesty thinks Hogginarmo is afraid? No, not of a hundred thousand lions! Follow me down into the circus, King Padella, and match thyself against one of yon brutes. Thou darest not. Let them both come on, then!’ And opening a grating of the box, he jumped lightly down into the circus.",haughty lay opera glass look scowl attendant touch dog say gore majesty think afraid lion follow circus match yon brute let come open grating box jump circus
