7,"""It seems to me,"" said the nurse, ""that the noises are much too loud for that. I have heard them all day, and my princess has asked me several times what they could be.

9,"As he spoke there came a great rolling rumble beneath them, and the house quivered. They all started up in affright, and rushing to the hall found the gentlemen-at-arms in consternation also. They had sent to wake their captain, who said from their description that it must have been an earthquake, an occurrence which, although very rare in that country, had taken place almost within the century; and then went to bed again, strange to say, and fell fast asleep without once thinking of Curdie, or associating the noises they had heard with what he had told them. He had not believed Curdie. If he had, he would at once have thought of what he had said, and would have taken precautions. As they heard nothing more, they concluded that Sir Walter was right, and that the danger was over for perhaps another hundred years. The fact, as discovered afterward, was that the goblins had, in working up a second sloping face of stone, arrived at a huge block which lay under the cellars of the house, within the line of the foundations. It was so round that when they succeeded, after hard work, in dislodging it without blasting, it rolled thundering down the slope with a bounding, jarring roll, which shook the foundations of the house. The goblins were themselves dismayed at the noise, for they knew, by careful spying and measuring, that they must now be very near, if not under, the king's house, and they feared giving an alarm. They, therefore, remained quiet for awhile, and when they began to work again, they no doubt thought themselves very fortunate in coming upon a vein of sand which filled a winding fissure in the rock on which the house was built. By scooping this away they soon came out in the king's wine-cellar.",speak come great roll rumble house quiver start affright rush hall find gentleman arm consternation send wake captain say description earthquake occurrence rare country take place century go bed strange say fall asleep think associate noise hear tell believe have think say take precaution hear conclude right danger year fact discover goblin work second slope face stone arrive huge block lay cellar house line foundation round succeed hard work dislodg blast roll thunder slope bound jarring roll shake foundation house goblin dismay noise know careful spying measure king house fear give alarm remain quiet begin work think fortunate come vein sand fill wind fissure rock house build scoop come king wine cellar 
10,"No sooner did they and where they were, than they scurried back again, like rats into their holes, and running at full speed to the goblin palace, announced their success to the king and queen with shouts of triumph. In a moment the goblin royal family and the whole goblin people were on their way in hot haste to the king's house, each eager to have a share in the glory of carrying off that same night the Princess Irene.",scurry rat hole run full speed goblin palace announce success king queen shout triumph moment goblin royal family whole goblin person way hot haste king house eager have share glory carry same night 
11,"The queen went stumping along in one shoe of stone and one of skin. This could not have been pleasant, and my readers may wonder that, with such skillful workmen about her, she had not yet replaced the shoe carried off by Curdie. As the king however had more than one ground of objection to her stone shoes, he no doubt took advantage of the discovery of her toes, and threatened to expose her deformity if she had another made. I presume he insisted on her being content with skin-shoes, and allowed her to wear the remaining granite one on the present occasion only because she was going out to war.",queen go stump shoe stone skin pleasant reader wonder such skillful workmen replace shoe carry king have more ground objection stone shoe take advantage discovery toe threaten expose deformity have make presume insist content skin shoe allow wear remain granite one present occasion go war 
12,"They soon arrived in the king's wine-cellar, and regardless of its huge vessels, of which they did not know the use, began as quietly as they could to force the door that led upward.",arrive king wine cellar huge vessel know use begin force door lead
