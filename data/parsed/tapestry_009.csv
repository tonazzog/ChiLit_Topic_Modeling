For a minute or two she could distinguish nothing, but another moan guided her in the right direction, and there, to her horror and distress, she saw the poor Prince lying on the ground, pale and death-like.

All day long I have been chased by hunters, who saw in me, I suppose, a valuable prize. I was terrified of the hour of sunset arriving and finding me far from home. I used my utmost endeavour to reach this in time, but, alas! I was overcome with fatigue, from which no spell protects me. At the entrance to these gardens I saw the sun disappear, and I fell exhausted, just as an arrow struck my right arm at the moment of my transformation.

The wound was not a very serious one; the Prince was suffering more from exhaustion and fatigue.",eye full tear help palace bind arm tend young learn many useful act kind father castle wound serious one suffer more exhaustion fatigue

Too startled at first to know whether she should rejoice or not, the Princess gazed at her work in bewilderment, when a voice of anguish, but, alas! a well-known voice, made her turn round. It was the Prince, hastening from the palace with an expression half of anger half of sorrowful reproach on his face.",say word sudden noise clap thunder shake air flash lightning seem glance alight skin instant shrivell cinder burnt glove startle first know rejoice gaze work bewilderment voice anguish know voice make turn hasten palace expression half anger half sorrowful reproach face

The Princess sank half fainting on the ground. When she again opened her eyes, Prince, palace, everything had disappeared. She was alone, quite alone, on a barren moorland, night coming on, and a cold cutting wind freezing the blood in her veins. And she was clothed in the plain black dress with which she had made her strange journey riding on the brown bull.",seek hill ice sea glass say word pass lip second thunderclap louder terrific first hear sink half fainting ground open eye palace disappear alone alone barren moorland night come cold cutting wind freeze blood vein cloth plain black dress make strange journey ride brown bull

24,"""'Seek me beyond the hill of ice and the sea of glass,' the Prince had said; and she rose up to begin her weary journey. As she rose her hand came in contact with something hard in the folds of her dress; it was her golden balls. With the greatest delight she took them out of her pocket and looked at them. They were as bright and beautiful as ever, and the fairy's prophecy returned to the Princess's mind.",seek hill ice sea glass say rise begin weary journey rise hand come contact hard fold dress golden ball great delight take pocket look bright beautiful fairy prophecy return mind

26,"""But there were sore trials to go through in the first place. The Princess set off on her journey. She had to walk many weary miles across the moor, the cold wind blowing in her face, the rough ground pricking her tender feet. But she walked on and on till at last the morning broke and she saw a road before her, bordered on one side by a forest of trees, for she had reached the extreme edge of the moor. She had gone but a little way when she came to a small and miserable hovel, from which issued feeble sounds of distress. The Princess went up to the door and looked in--a very old woman sat huddled up in a corner weeping and lamenting herself.",be sore trial go first place set journey have walk many weary mile moor cold wind blow face rough ground prick tender foot walk last morning break see road border side forest tree reach extreme edge moor go little way come small miserable hovel issue feeble sound distress go door look old woman huddle corner weep lament

It fell on to the piled-up wood, and immediately a bright flame danced up the chimney. The Princess picked up her ball and put it back in her pocket, cheered and encouraged by this proof of their magic power. The old woman came near to the fire, and stretched out her withered hands to the blaze.",take stick arrange fireplace choose dry rub get light ball drop pocket fall pile wood bright flame dance chimney pick ball put pocket cheer encourage proof magic power old woman come fire stretch wither hand blaze

Here, take these shoes--with them you can safely walk over the sea of glass, and with this staff you can mount the hill of ice,' and as she spoke she handed to the Princess a pair of curiously carved wooden shoes and a short sharp-pointed stick. The Princess took them gratefully, and would have thanked the old woman, whom she now knew to be a fairy, but she stopped her. ""'Think not,' she said, 'that your difficulties will be over when you have reached the summit of the hill of ice. But all I can do for you more is to give you this nut, which you must open in your moment of sorest perplexity.'",day travel say see foot hill ice lie sea glass mortal foot unaided cross one ascend other take shoe walk sea glass staff mount hill ice speak hand pair carve wooden shoe short sharp point stick take thank old woman know fairy stop think say difficulty reach summit hill ice do more give nut open moment sorest perplexity

37,"""It would be impossible to describe all she went through during the seven days which passed before she reached the sea of glass. She saw some strange and wonderful sights, for in those days the world was very different from what it is now. She was often tired and hungry, thankful for a cup of milk or crust of bread from those she happened to meet on the way. But her courage never failed her, and at last, on the morning of the eighth day, she saw shining before her in the sunlight the great silent sea of glass of which she had been told.",impossible describe go day pass reach sea glass see strange wonderful sight day world different tired hungry thankful cup milk crust bread happen meet way courage fail last morning eighth day see shine sunlight great silent sea glass tell 
38,"""It would have been hopeless to attempt to cross it without fairy aid, for it was polished more brightly than any mirror, and so hard that no young Princess's bones could have borne a fall on its cruel surface. But with the magic shoes there was less than no difficulty, for no sooner had the Princess slipped her feet into them than they turned into skates, and very wonderful skates, for they possessed the power of enabling their wearer to glide along with the greatest swiftness. The Princess had never skated in her life, and she was delighted.",hopeless attempt cross fairy aid polished mirror young bone borne fall cruel surface magic shoe less difficulty slip foot turn skate wonderful skate possess power enable wearer glide great swiftness skate life delighted

40,"""She looked upwards with something like despair. It was a terrible ascent to attempt, for the mountain was all but straight, so steep were its sides of hard, clear, sparkling ice. The Princess looked at her feet, the magic shoes had already disappeared; she looked at the staff she still held in her hand--how could a stick help her up such a mountain? and half impatiently, half hopelessly, she threw it from her. Instantly it stretched itself out, growing wider and wider, the notches in the wood expanding, till it had taken the shape of a roughly-made ladder of irregular steps, hooked on to the ice by the sharp spike at its end, and the Princess, ashamed of her discouragement, mounted up the steps without difficulty, and as she reached the top one, of itself the ladder pushed up before her, so that she could mount straight up without hesitation.",look despair terrible ascent attempt mountain straight steep side hard clear sparkling ice look foot magic shoe disappear look staff hold hand stick help mountain half half throw stretch grow wide wide notche wood expand take shape make ladder irregular step hook ice sharp spike end ashamed discouragement mount step difficulty reach top ladder push mount hesitation 
41,"""She stepped forward bravely. It took a long time, even though she had the fairy aid, and by the time she reached the top of the hill night had fallen, and but for the light of the stars, she would not have known where to step. A long plain stretched before her--no trees or bushes even broke the wide expanse. There was no shelter of any kind, and the Princess found herself obliged to walk on and on, for the wind was very cold, and she dared not let herself rest. This night and the next day were the hardest part of all the journey, and seemed even more so, because the Princess had hoped that the sea of glass and the hill of ice were to be the worst of her difficulties. More than once she was tempted to crack the nut, the last of the old woman's presents, but she refrained, saying to herself she might yet be in greater need, and she walked on and on, though nearly dead with cold and fatigue, till late in the afternoon. Then at last, far before her still, she saw gleaming the lights of a city, and, encouraged by the sight, she gathered her courage together and pressed on, till, at the door of a little cottage at the outskirts of the town, she sank down with fatigue. An old woman, with a kind face, came out of the house and invited her to enter and rest.",step take long time have fairy aid time reach top hill night fall light star know step long plain stretch tree bush break wide expanse be shelter kind find oblige walk wind cold let rest night next day hard part journey seem hope sea glass hill ice bad difficulty more tempt crack nut last old woman present refrain say great need walk dead cold fatigue afternoon last see gleam light city encourage sight gather courage press door little cottage outskirt town sink fatigue old woman kind face come house invite enter rest

43,"""'Ah yes!' replied the poor Princess, 'very far. I am nearly dead with fatigue;' and indeed she looked very miserable. Her beautiful fair hair was all tumbled and soiled, her poor little feet were scratched and blistered, her black dress torn and draggled--she looked far more like a beggar-maiden than like a princess. But yet, her pretty way of speaking and gentle manners showed she was not what she seemed, and when she had washed her face and combed her hair, the old woman looked at her with admiration.",reply poor dead fatigue look miserable beautiful fair hair tumble soil poor little foot scratch blister black dress tear draggle look beggar maiden princess pretty way speak gentle manners show seem wash face comb hair old woman look admiration

45,"""'Is your Prince to be married to-day?' asked the Princess.",marry day ask 
46,"""'No, not to-day--to-morrow,' said the old woman. 'But the strange thing is that it is not yet known who is to be his bride. The Prince has only lately returned to his home, for, for many years, he has been shut up by a fairy spell in a beautiful palace in the north, and now that the spell is broken and he is restored to his parents, they are anxious to see him married. But he must still be under a spell of some kind, they say, for though he has all that heart can wish, he is ever sad and silent, and as if he were thinking of something far away. And he has said that he will marry no princess but one who can catch three golden balls at a time, as if young princesses were brought up to be jugglers! Nevertheless, all the princesses far and wide have been practising their best at catching balls, and to-morrow the great feasts are to begin, and she who catches best is to be chosen out of all the princesses as the bride of our Prince.'",day say old woman strange thing know bride return home many year shut fairy spell beautiful palace north spell break restore parent anxious see married spell kind say have heart wish sad silent think say marry princess catch golden ball time young princess bring juggler princess wide practise good catching ball great feast begin catch good choose princess bride

53,"""The next day the old woman went out early to hear all about the festivities. She came back greatly excited.",next day old woman go hear festivity come excited 
54,"""'Come quickly,' she said. 'The crowd is so great that no one will notice your poor clothes. And, indeed, among all the pretty girls there will be none prettier than you,' she added, looking admiringly at the Princess, who had arranged her beautiful hair and brushed her soiled dress, and who looked sweeter than ever now that she was rested and refreshed. 'There are three princesses who have come to the feast,' she went on, 'the first from the south, the second from the east, the third from the west, each more beautiful than another, the people say. The trial of the golden balls is to be in the great hall of the palace, and a friend of mine has promised me a place at one of the windows which overlook it, so that we can see the whole;' and the Princess, feeling as if she were in a dream, rose up to accompany the old woman, her balls and her precious nut in her pocket.",come say crowd great notice poor clothes pretty girl be pretty add look arrange beautiful hair brush soil dress look sweeter rest refresh be princess come feast go first south second east third west beautiful person say trial golden ball great hall palace friend promise place window overlook see whole feel dream rise accompany old woman ball precious nut pocket 
55,"""They made their way through the crowd and placed themselves at the window, as the old woman had said. The Princess looked down at the great hall below, all magnificently decorated and already filled with spectators. Suddenly the trumpet sounded, and the Prince in whose honour was all the rejoicing entered. At sight of him--her own Prince indeed, but looking so strangely pale and sad that she would hardly have recognised him--the Princess could not restrain a little cry.",make way crowd place window old woman say look great hall decorate fill spectator trumpet sound honour rejoicing enter sight own look pale sad recognise restrain little cry 
56,"""'What is it?' said the old woman.",say old woman 
57,"""'A passer-by trod on my foot,' said the Princess, fearful of attracting attention. And the old woman said no more, for at this moment another blast of trumpets announced the arrival of the princesses, who were to make the trial of the balls. The first was tall and dark, with raven tresses and brilliant, flashing eyes. She was dressed in a robe of rich maize colour, and as she took her place on the dais she looked round her, as if to say, 'Who can compete with me in beauty or in skill?' And she was the Princess of the south.",passer trod foot say fearful attract attention old woman say more moment blast trumpet announce arrival princess make trial ball first tall dark raven tresse brilliant flash eye dress robe rich maize colour take place dais look say compete beauty skill south 
58,"""The second was also tall, and her hair was of a deep rich brown, and her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks rosy. She was dressed in bright pink, and laughed as she came forward, as if sure of herself and her attractions. And she was the Princess of the east.",second tall hair deep rich brown eye sparkling cheek rosy dress bright pink laugh come sure attraction east 
59,"""The third moved slowly, and as if she cared little what was thought of her, so confident was she of her pre-eminence. She wore a blue robe, and her face was pale and her eyes cold, though beautiful. And her hair had a reddish tinge, but yet she too was beautiful. And she was the Princess of the west.",third move care little think confident pre-eminence wear blue robe face pale eye cold beautiful hair have reddish tinge beautiful west 
60,"""The Prince bowed low to each, but no smile lit up his grave face, and his glance rested but an instant on each fair Princess as she approached.",bow low smile light grave face glance rest instant fair approach 
61,"""'Are these ladies all?' he asked, in a low voice, as if expecting yet more. And when the answer came, 'Yes, these are all,' a still deeper melancholy settled on his face, and he seemed indifferent to all about him.",lady ask low voice expect more answer come deep melancholy settle face seem indifferent 
62,"""Then the trial began. The Prince had three golden balls, one of which he offered to each Princess. They took them, and each threw one back to him. Then one after another, as quick as lightning, he threw all three to the yellow Princess. She caught them all and threw them back; again he returned them, but the first only, reached her hand, the second and third fell to the ground, and with another low bow the Prince turned from her, and her proud face grew scarlet with anger. The pink Princess fared no better. She was laughing so, as if to show her confidence, that she missed the third ball, even at the first throw, and when the Prince turned also from her she laughed again, though this time her laughter was not all mirth. Then the cold blue Princess came forward. She caught the balls better, but at the third throw, one of them rising higher than the others, she would not trouble herself to stretch her arm out farther, so it fell to the ground, and as the Prince turned from her likewise, a great silence came over the crowd.",trial begin have golden ball offer take throw quick lightning throw yellow catch throw return first reach hand second third fall ground low bow turn proud face grow scarlet anger pink fare good laugh show confidence miss third ball first throw turn laugh time laughter mirth cold blue come catch ball good third throw rise high other trouble stretch arm fall ground turn great silence come crowd 
63,"""Suddenly a cry arose. 'A fourth Princess,' the people shouted, and the old woman up at the window was so eager to see the new-comer that she did not notice that her companion had disappeared. She had watched the failure of the two first Princesses, then seeing what was coming she had quietly made her way through the crowd to a hidden corner behind the great pillars of the hall. There, her hands trembling with eagerness, she drew forth from the magic nut, which she had cracked with her pretty teeth, a wonderful fairy robe of spotless white. In an instant her black dress was thrown to her feet, and the white garment, which fitted her as if by magic, had taken its place. Never was Princess dressed in such a hurry, but never was toilette more successful. And as the cry arose of 'A fourth Princess' she made her way up the hall. From one end to the other she came, rapidly making her way through the crowd, which cleared before her in surprise and admiration, for as she walked she threw before her, catching them ever as she went, her golden balls. Her fair hair floated on her shoulders, her white robe gleamed like snow, her sweet face, flushed with hope and eagerness, was like that of a happy child, her eyes saw nothing but the one figure standing at the far end of the hall, the figure of the Prince, who, as the cry reached his ears, started forward with a hope he hardly dared encourage, holding out his hands as she came nearer and yet nearer in joyfulness of welcome.",cry arise fourth person shout old woman window eager see new comer notice companion disappear watch failure first see come make way crowd hide corner great pillar hall hand tremble eagerness draw magic nut crack pretty tooth wonderful fairy robe spotless white instant black dress throw foot white garment fit magic take place dress hurry toilette successful cry arise fourth make way hall end other come make way crowd clear surprise admiration walk throw catching go golden ball fair hair float shoulder white robe gleam snow sweet face flush hope eagerness happy child eye see figure stand far end hall figure cry reach ear start hope dare encourage hold hand come joyfulness welcome 
64,"""But she waved him back--then, taking her place where the other Princesses had stood, she threw her balls, one, two, three; in an instant they were caught by the Prince, and returned to her like flashes of lightning over and over again, never failing, never falling, as if attached by invisible cords, till at last a great cry arose from the crowds, and the Prince led forward, full in the view of the people, his beautiful bride, his true Princess.",wave take place other princess stand throw ball instant catch return flash lightning fail fall attach invisible cord last great cry arise crowd lead full view person beautiful bride true 
65,"""Then all her troubles were forgotten, and every one rejoiced, save perhaps the three unsuccessful Princesses, who consoled themselves by saying there was magic in it, and so possibly there was. But there is more than one kind of magic, and some kinds, it is to be hoped, the world will never be without. And messengers were sent to summon to the wedding the father and mother of the Princess, who all this time had been in doubt and anxiety as to the fate of their dear child. And the kind old woman who had sheltered her in her poverty and distress was not forgotten.""",trouble forget one rejoice save unsuccessful console say be magic be be more kind magic kind hope world messenger send summon wedding father mother time doubt anxiety fate dear child kind old woman shelter poverty distress forget 
66,"The voice stopped--for a minute or two the children sat silent, not sure if they were to hear anything else. Strangely enough, as the story went on, it seemed more and more as if it were Marcelline's voice that was telling it, and at last Hugh looked up to see if it was still the white lady, whose knee his head was resting on. Jeanne too looked up at the same moment, and both children gave a little cry of surprise. The white lady had disappeared, and it was indeed Marcelline who was in her place. The white room, the white chairs, the white cats, the spinning-wheel, and the pointed windows, had all gone, and instead there was old Marcelline with her knitting-needles gently clicking in a regular way, that somehow to Hugh seemed mixed up with his remembrance of the soft whirr of the wheel, her neatly frilled cap round her face, and her bright dark eyes smiling down at the children. Hugh felt so sorry and disappointed that he shut his eyes tight and tried to go on dreaming, if indeed dreaming it was. But it was no use. He leant his face against Marcelline's soft white apron and tried to fancy it the fairy lady's fairy robe; but it was no use. He had to sit up and look about him.",voice stop minute child sit silent sure hear else story go seem voice tell last look see white lady knee head rest look same moment child give little cry surprise white lady disappear place white room white chair white cat spinning wheel point window go be old knitting needle click regular way seem mix remembrance soft whirr wheel frilled cap face bright dark eye smile child feel sorry disappointed shut eye tight try go dreaming dreaming use lean face soft white apron try fancy fairy lady fairy robe use have sit look

68,"Hugh looked at Jeanne. It couldn't be a dream then--there _had_ been a story, for if he had been asleep, of course he couldn't have heard it. He said nothing, however--he waited to see what Jeanne would say. Jeanne tossed back her head impatiently.",look dream story asleep course hear say wait see say toss head

70,"Hugh was so pleased at what Jeanne said that he didn't mind a bit about Marcelline having taken the place of the white lady. Jeanne was the same as he was--that was all he cared about. He jumped up eagerly--they were in Jeanne's room, close to the fire, and both Jeanne and he had their little red flannel dressing-gowns on.",pleased say mind bit take place white lady same care jump room close fire have little red flannel dress gown
