1,CHAPTER 2. Black Dog Appears and Disappears,chapter black dog appear disappear 
2," IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring. He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.",occur first mysterious event rid last captain see affair bitter cold winter long hard frost heavy gale plain first poor father little likely see spring sink mother have inn hand keep busy pay much regard unpleasant guest 
3,"It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey.",morning pinch frosty morning cove grey hoar frost ripple lap stone sun low touch hilltop shine seaward captain rise usual set beach cutlass swing broad skirt old blue coat brass telescope arm hat tilt head remember breath hang smoke wake strode last sound hear turn big rock loud snort indignation mind run 
4,"Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too.",mother father lay breakfast table captain return parlour door open man step set eye pale tallowy creature want finger left hand wear cutlass look fighter have eye open seafaring man leg remember one puzzle have smack sea 
5,"I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near. I paused where I was, with my napkin in my hand.",ask service say take rum go room fetch sit table motion draw pause napkin hand 
6,"""Come here, sonny,"" says he. ""Come nearer here.""",come say come 
7,I took a step nearer.,take step 
8,"""Is this here table for my mate Bill?"" he asked with a kind of leer.",table mate ask kind leer 
9,"I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain.",tell know mate person stay house call captain 
10,"""Well,"" said he, ""my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not. He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has my mate Bill. We'll put it, for argument like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we'll put it, if you like, that that cheek's the right one. Ah, well! I told you. Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?""",say mate call captain have cut cheek mighty pleasant way drink have mate put argument captain have cut cheek put like cheek right one tell mate house 
11,I told him he was out walking.,tell walk 
12,"""Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?""",way way gone 
13,"And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions, ""Ah,"" said he, ""this'll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.""",point rock tell captain likely return answer few other question say good drink mate 
14,"The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. Once I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me. ""I have a son of my own,"" said he, ""as like you as two blocks, and he's all the pride of my 'art. But the great thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. Now, if you had sailed along of Bill, you wouldn't have stood there to be spoke to twice--not you. That was never Bill's way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him. And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, bless his old 'art, to be sure. You and me'll just go back into the parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we'll give Bill a little surprise--bless his 'art, I say again.""",expression face say word pleasant have own reason think stranger mistaken suppose mean say affair think difficult know do stranger keep hang inn door peer corner cat wait mouse step road call obey fancy horrible change come tallowy face order oath make jump return former manner half fawn half sneering patt shoulder tell good boy take fancy have son own say block pride art great thing boy discipline sonny discipline sail stand speak way way sich sail mate spy glass arm bless old art sure go parlour get door give little surprise bless art say 
15,"So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. I was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat.",say stranger back parlour put corner hide open door uneasy alarmed fancy add fear observe stranger frighten clear hilt cutlass loosen blade sheath time wait keep swallow feel use call lump throat 
16,"At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him.",last strode captain slam door look right left march room breakfast await 
17,"""Bill,"" said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big.",say stranger voice think try make bold big 
18,"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick.",captain spun heel front brown go face nose blue have look man see ghost evil one bad word feel sorry see moment turn old sick 
19,"""Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,"" said the stranger.",come know know old shipmate say stranger 
20,The captain made a sort of gasp.,captain make sort gasp 
21,"""Black Dog!"" said he.",black dog say 
22,"""And who else?"" returned the other, getting more at his ease. ""Black Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,"" holding up his mutilated hand.",else return other get more ease black dog come see old shipmate see sight time lose talon hold mutilate hand 
23,"""Now, look here,"" said the captain; ""you've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?""",look say captain run speak 
24,"""That's you, Bill,"" returned Black Dog, ""you're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.""",return black right have glass rum dear child take like sit talk square old shipmate 
25,"When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat.",return rum seat side captain breakfast table black door sit have eye old shipmate think retreat 
26,"He bade me go and leave the door wide open. ""None of your keyholes for me, sonny,"" he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar.",bid go leave door open keyhole say leave retire bar 
27,"For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.",long time do good listen hear low gattling last voice begin grow high pick word oath captain 
28,"""No, no, no, no; and an end of it!"" he cried once. And again, ""If it comes to swinging, swing all, say I.""",end cry come swing swing say 
29,"Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow. You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day.",be tremendous explosion oath other noise chair table go lump clash steel follow cry pain next instant see black full flight captain pursue draw cutlass former stream blood left shoulder door captain aim fugitive last tremendous cut split chine intercept big signboard see notch low side frame day 
30,"That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house.",blow last battle road black spite wound show wonderful clean pair heel disappear edge hill minute captain part stand stare signboard bewilder man pass hand eye several time last turn house 
31,"""Jim,"" says he, ""rum""; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught himself with one hand against the wall.",say rum speak reel little catch hand wall 
32,"""Are you hurt?"" cried I.",hurt cry 
33,"""Rum,"" he repeated. ""I must get away from here. Rum! Rum!""",repeat get rum rum 
34,"I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. At the same instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running downstairs to help me. Between us we raised his head. He was breathing very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour.",run fetch unsteadied fall break glass foul tap get own way hear loud fall parlour run beheld captain lie full length floor same instant mother alarm cry fighting come run help raise head breathe loud hard eye close face horrible colour 
35,"""Dear, deary me,"" cried my mother, ""what a disgrace upon the house! And your poor father sick!""",dear deary cry mother disgrace house poor father sick 
36,"In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger. I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron. It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in, on his visit to my father.",meantime have idea do help captain other thought get death hurt scuffle stranger get rum sure try put throat tooth shut jaw strong iron happy relief door open come visit father 
37,"""Oh, doctor,"" we cried, ""what shall we do? Where is he wounded?""",doctor cry do wound 
38,"""Wounded? A fiddle-stick's end!"" said the doctor. ""No more wounded than you or I. The man has had a stroke, as I warned him. Now, Mrs. Hawkins, just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing about it. For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.""",wound fiddle stick end say doctor wound man have stroke warn run husband tell possible part do good save fellow trebly worthless life get basin 
39,"When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed in several places. ""Here's luck,"" ""A fair wind,"" and ""Billy Bones his fancy,"" were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit.",get basin doctor rip captain sleeve expose great sinewy arm tattooe several place luck fair wind fancy execute forearm shoulder be sketch gallow man hang do think great spirit 
40,"""Prophetic,"" said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. ""And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,"" he said, ""are you afraid of blood?""",prophetic say doctor touch picture finger name have look colour blood say afraid blood 
41,"""No, sir,"" said I.",sir say 
42,"""Well, then,"" said he, ""you hold the basin""; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein.",say hold basin take lancet open vein 
43,"A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, ""Where's Black Dog?""",great deal blood take captain open eye look recognize doctor unmistakable frown glance fall look relieved colour change try raise cry black dog 
44,"""There is no Black Dog here,"" said the doctor, ""except what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--""",be black dog say doctor have own back drink rum have stroke tell own will drag grave 
45,"""That's not my name,"" he interrupted.",name interrupt 
46,"""Much I care,"" returned the doctor. ""It's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible. Come, now, make an effort. I'll help you to your bed for once.""",much care return doctor name buccaneer acquaintance call sake shortness have say glass rum kill take take stake wig break short die understand die go own place man come make effort help bed 
47,"Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting.",much trouble manage hoist lay bed head fall pillow fainting 
48,"""Now, mind you,"" said the doctor, ""I clear my conscience--the name of rum for you is death.""",mind say doctor clear conscience name rum death 
49,"And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the arm.",go see father take arm 
50,"""This is nothing,"" he said as soon as he had closed the door. ""I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke would settle him.""",say close door draw blood keep quiet lie week good thing stroke settle
