2," A large quantity of plunder was obtained at Masulipatam. Half was at once divided among the troops, according to promise, and the other half retained until the permission, applied for by Colonel Forde, was received from Madras for its division among them.",large quantity plunder obtain half divide troops accord promise other half retain permission apply receive division 
3,"The morning after the capture of the town, the Mahratta horse of Salabut Jung appeared. The nizam was furious when he found that he had arrived too late; but he resolved that when the three hundred French troops, daily expected by sea, arrived, he would besiege Forde in his turn; as, with the new arrivals, Du Rocher's force would alone be superior to that of Forde, and there would be, in addition, his own army of forty thousand men.",morning capture town horse appear furious find arrive late resolve french troops expect sea arrive besiege turn new arrival force superior be addition own army man 
4,"The ships arrived off the port three days later, and sent a messenger on shore to Conflans. Finding that no answer was returned, and that the fire had entirely ceased, they came to the conclusion that the place was captured by the English, and sailed away to Pondicherry again. Had Du Rocher taken the precaution of having boats in readiness to communicate with them, inform them of the real state of affairs, and order them to land farther along the coast and join him, Forde would have been besieged in his turn, although certainly the siege would have been ineffectual.",ship arrive port day send messenger shore find answer return fire cease come conclusion place capture sail take precaution have boat readiness communicate inform real state affair order land coast join besiege turn siege ineffectual 
5,"Rajah Anandraz, greatly terrified at the approach of the nizam, had, two days after the capture of the place, received a portion of the plunder as his share, and marched away to his own country; Forde, disgusted with his conduct throughout the campaign, making no effort whatever to retain him.",terrify approach day capture place receive portion plunder share march own country disgust conduct campaign make effort retain 
6,"When Salabut Jung heard that the French had sailed away to Pondicherry, he felt that his prospects of retaking the town were small; and, at the same time receiving news that his own dominions were threatened by an enemy, he concluded a treaty with Forde, granting Masulipatam and the Northern Sirkars to the English, and agreeing never again to allow any French troops to enter his dominions. He then marched back to his own country.",hear sail feel prospect retake town small same time receive news own dominion threaten enemy conclude treaty grant northern agree allow french troops enter dominion march own country 
7,"Colonel Forde sailed with a portion of the force to Calcutta, where he shortly afterwards commanded at the battle of Chinsurah, where the Dutch, who had made vast preparations to dispute the supremacy of the English, were completely defeated; and thenceforth they, as well as the French, sunk to the rank of small trading colonies under British protection, in Bengal.",sail portion force command battle make vast preparation dispute supremacy defeat thenceforth sink rank small trading colony british protection 
8,"Charlie returned to Madras, and journeying up the country he joined the main body of his troop, under Peters. They had been engaged in several dashing expeditions, and had rendered great service; but they had been reduced in numbers, by action and sickness; and the whole force, when reunited, only numbered eighty sabres--Lieutenant Hallowes being killed. Peters had been twice wounded. The two friends were greatly pleased to meet again, and had much to tell each other of their adventures, since they parted.",return journey country join main body troop engage several dash expedition render great service reduce number action sickness whole force reunite number sabre kill wound friend pleased meet have much tell other adventure part 
9,"The next morning, a deputation of four of the men waited upon Charlie. They said that, from their share of the booty of the various places they had taken, all were now possessed of sums sufficient, in India, to enable them to live in comfort for the rest of their lives. They hoped, therefore, that Charlie would ask the authorities at Madras to disband the corps, and allow them to return home. Their commander, however, pointed out to them that the position was still a critical one; that the French possessed a very powerful army at Pondicherry, which would shortly take the field; and that the English would need every one of their soldiers, to meet the storm. If victorious, there could be no doubt that a final blow would be dealt to French influence, and that the Company would then be able to reduce its forces. A few months would settle the event, and it would, he knew, be useless to apply for their discharge before that time. He thought he could promise them, however, that by the end of the year, at latest, their services would be dispensed with.",next morning deputation man wait say share booty various place take possess sum sufficient enable live comfort rest life hope ask authority disband corps allow return commander point position critical one possess powerful army take field need one soldier meet storm victorious be doubt final blow deal french influence company able reduce force few month settle event know useless apply discharge time think promise end year late service dispens 
10,"The men, although rather disappointed, retired, content to make the best of the circumstances. Desertions were very frequent in the Sepoy force of the Company, as the men, returning to their native villages and resuming their former dress and occupation, were in no danger whatever of discovery. But in Charlie's force not a single desertion had taken place since it was raised; as the men knew that, by leaving the colours, they would forfeit their share of the prize money, held for them in the Madras treasury.",man disappointed retire content make good circumstance desertion frequent force man return native village resume former dress occupation danger discovery force single desertion take place raise man know leave colour forfeit share prize money hold treasury 
11,"""Have you heard from home lately?"" Peters asked.",hear home ask 
12,"""Yes,"" Charlie said. ""There was a large batch of letters lying for me, at Madras. My eldest sister, who has now been married three years, has just presented me with a second nephew. Katie and my mother are well.""",say be large batch letter lie old sister marry year present second nephew mother well 
13,"""Your sister is not engaged yet?"" Peters asked.",sister engage ask 
14,"""No. Katie says she's quite heart whole at present. Let me see--how old is she now? It is just eight years and a half since we left England, and she was twelve years old then. She is now past twenty.",say heart whole present let see old year half leave year old 
15,"""She would do nicely for you, Peters, when you go back. It would be awfully jolly, if you two were to fall in love with each other.""",do go jolly fall love other 
16,"""I feel quite disposed to do so,"" Peters said, laughing, ""from your descriptions of her. I've heard so much of her, in all the time we've been together; and she writes such bright merry letters, that I seem to know her quite well.""",feel dispose do say laugh description hear much time write such bright merry letter seem know 
17,"For Charlie, during the long evenings by the campfires, had often read to his friend the lively letters which he received from his sisters. Peters had no sisters of his own; and he had more than once sent home presents, from the many articles of jewelry which fell to his share of the loot of captured fortresses, to his friend's sisters, saying to Charlie that he had no one in England to send things to, and that it kept up his tie with the old country; for he had been left an orphan, as a child.",long evening campfire read friend lively letter receive sister have sister own have more send home present many article jewelry fall share loot capture fortress friend sister say have send thing keep tie old country leave orphan child 
18,"The day after the deputation from his men had spoken to Charlie, Tim said:",day deputation man speak say 
19,"""I hope, yer honor, that whin the troop's disbanded, you will be going home for a bit, yourself.""",hope honor troop disband go bit 
20,"""I intend to do so, Tim. I have been wanting to get away, for the last two years, but I did not like to ask for leave until everything was settled here. And what is more, when I once get back, I don't think they will ever see me in India again. I have sufficient means to live as a wealthy man in England, and I've seen enough fighting to last a lifetime.""",intend do want get last year like ask leave settle more get think see have sufficient means live wealthy man see enough fighting last lifetime 
21,"""Hooroo!"" shouted Tim. ""That's the best word I've heard for a long time. And I shall settle down as yer honor's butler, and look after the grand house, and see that you're comfortable.""",shout good word hear long time settle honor butler look grand house see comfortable 
22,"""You must never leave me, Tim, that's certain,"" Charlie said. ""At least, till you marry and set up an establishment of your own.""",leave certain say least marry set establishment own 
23,"""If I can't marry without leaving yer honor, divil a wife will Tim Kelly ever take.""",marry leave honor divil wife take 
24,"""Wait till you see the right woman, Tim. There is no saying what the strongest of us will do, when he's once caught in a woman's net. However, we'll talk of that when the time comes.""",wait see right woman be say strong do catch woman net talk time come 
25,"""And there's Hossein, yer honor. Fire and water wouldn't keep him away from you, though what he'll do in the colds of the winter at home is more than I know. It makes me laugh to see how his teeth chatter, and how the creetur shivers of a cold morning, here. But, cold or no cold, he'd follow you to the north pole, and climb up it if yer honor told him.""",be honor fire water keep do cold winter home more know make laugh see tooth chatter creetur shiver cold morning cold cold follow north pole climb honor tell 
26,Charlie laughed.,laugh 
27,"""He is safe not to be put to the test there, Tim. However, you may be sure that if Hossein is willing to go to England with me, he shall go. He has saved my life more than once; and you and he shall never part from me, so long as you are disposed to stay by my side.""",safe put test sure willing go go save life more part dispose stay side 
28,"For some months, no great undertaking was attempted on either side. Many petty sieges and skirmishes took place, each party preparing for the great struggle, which was to decide the fate of Southern India.",month great undertaking attempt side many petty siege skirmishe take place party prepare great struggle decide fate southern 
29,"At last, in January, 1760, the rival armies approached each other. Captain Sherlock, with thirty Europeans and three hundred Sepoys, were besieged by the French in the fort of Vandivash, which had shortly before been captured by them from the French.",last rival army approach other besiege fort capture 
30,"Lally was himself commanding the siege, having as his second in command Monsieur Bussy, of whom, however, he was more jealous than ever. Lally's own incapacity was so marked that the whole army, and even Lally's own regiment, recognized the superior talents of Bussy. But although Lally constantly asked the advice of his subordinate, his jealousy of that officer generally impelled him to neglect it.",commanding siege have second command jealous own incapacity mark whole army own regiment recognize superior talent ask advice subordinate jealousy officer impell neglect 
31,"When the English, under Colonel Coote, who now commanded their forces in Madras, were known to be advancing against him, Bussy strongly advised that the siege should be abandoned, and a strong position taken up for the battle. The advice was unquestionably good, but Lally neglected it, and remained in front of Vandivash until the English were seen approaching. The French cavalry, among whom were three hundred European dragoons, and a cloud of Mahratta horse moved forward against the English, whose troops were scattered on the line of march.",command force know advance advise siege abandon strong position take battle advice good neglect remain front see approach french cavalry european dragoon cloud horse move troops scatter line march 
32,"Colonel Coote brought up two guns, and these, being kept concealed from the enemy until they came within two hundred yards, opened suddenly upon them, while the Sepoys fired heavily with their muskets. The Mahrattas rapidly turned and rode off, and the French cavalry, finding themselves alone, retired in good order.",bring gun keep conceal enemy come yard open fire musket turn ride french cavalry find alone retire good order 
33,"Colonel Coote now drew up his army in order of battle, and marched his troops so as to take up a position in front of some gardens, and other inclosures, which extended for some distance from the foot of the mountains out on to the plain. These inclosures would serve as a defence, in case the army should be forced to retire from the open.",draw army order battle march troops take position front garden other inclosure extend distance foot mountain plain inclosure serve defence case army force retire open 
34,"The French remained immovable in their camp. Seeing this, Colonel Coote marched his troops to the right, the infantry taking up their post in the stony ground at the foot of the mountain, at a mile and a half from the French camp. Some of the French cavalry came out to reconnoitre; but, being fired upon, returned.",remain immovable camp see march troops right infantry take post stony ground foot mountain mile half french camp french cavalry come reconnoitre fire return 
35,"Finding that the French would not come out to attack, Colonel Coote again advanced until he reached a point where, swinging round his right, he faced the enemy in a position of great strength. His right was now covered by the fire of the fort, his left by the broken ground at the foot of the hills.",find come attack advance reach point swing right face enemy position great strength right cover fire fort left break ground foot hill 
36,"As soon as the English had taken up their position, the French sallied out from their camp and formed in line of battle. The French cavalry were on their right; next to these was the regiment of Lorraine, four hundred strong; in the centre the battalion of India, seven hundred strong. Next to these was Lally's regiment, four hundred strong, its left resting upon an intrenched tank, which was held by three hundred marines and sailors from their fleet, with four guns. Twelve other guns were in line, three between each regiment. Four hundred Sepoys were in reserve, at a tank in rear of that held by the marines. Nine hundred Sepoys held a ridge behind the position, but in front of the camp, and at each end of this ridge was an intrenchment, guarded by fifty Europeans. A hundred and fifty Europeans and three hundred Sepoys remained in the batteries, facing Vandivash. The whole force consisted of two thousand four hundred Europeans, and sixteen hundred Sepoys. The Mahrattas, three thousand strong, remained in their own camp, and did not advance to the assistance of their allies.",take position sall camp form line battle french cavalry right regiment strong centre battalion strong regiment strong left rest intrench tank hold marine sailor fleet gun other gun line regiment sepoy reserve tank rear hold marine hold ridge position front camp end ridge intrenchment guard sepoy remain battery face whole force consist sepoy strong remain own camp advance assistance ally 
37,"The English army consisted of nineteen hundred Europeans, of whom eighty were cavalry, two thousand one hundred Sepoys, twelve hundred and fifty irregular horse, and twenty-six field guns. The Sepoys were on the flanks, the Company's two battalions in the centre, with Coote's regiment on their right and Draper's on their left. The four grenadier companies of the white regiments were withdrawn from the fighting line; and, with two hundred Sepoys on each flank, were held as a reserve. Ten field pieces were in line with the troops; two, with two companies of Sepoys, were posted a little on the left; the rest were in reserve. The English line was placed somewhat obliquely across that of the French, their left being the nearest to the enemy.",english army consist cavalry sepoy irregular horse field gun flank company battalion centre regiment right left grenadier company white regiment withdraw fighting line sepoy flank hold reserve field piece line troops company post little left rest reserve english line place french left near enemy 
38,"As the English took up their position, Lally led out his cavalry, made a wide sweep round the plain, and then advanced against the English horse, who were drawn up some little distance behind the reserve. Upon seeing their approach, the whole of the irregular horse fled at once, leaving only Charlie's troop remaining. The Sepoys with the two guns on the left were ordered to turn these round, so as to take the advancing French in flank; but the flight of their horse had shaken the natives, and the French cavalry would have fallen, unchecked, on Charlie's little troop, which was already moving forward to meet them, had not Captain Barlow, who commanded the British artillery, turned two of his guns and opened fire upon them.",take position lead cavalry make wide sweep plain advance english horse draw little distance reserve see approach whole irregular horse flead leave troop remain gun left order turn take advance flank flight horse shake native french cavalry fall unchecked little troop move meet command british artillery turn gun open fire 
39,"Fifteen men and horses fell at the first discharge, throwing the rest into some confusion; and at the next deadly discharge, the whole turned and rode off. Seeing the enemy retreating, many of the irregular horse rode back, and, joining Charlie's troop, pursued them round to the rear of their own camp.",man horse fall first discharge throw rest confusion next deadly discharge whole turn ride see enemy retreat many irregular horse ride join troop pursue rear own camp 
40,"For a short time a cannonade was kept up by the guns on both sides, the English fire, being better directed, causing some damage. Upon Lally's return to his camp with the cavalry, he at once gave the order to advance. Coote ordered the Europeans of his force to do the same, the Sepoys to remain on their ground.",short time cannonade keep gun side english fire direct cause damage return camp cavalry give order advance order force do same remain ground 
41,"The musketry fire began at one o'clock. The English, according to Coote's orders, retained theirs until the enemy came close at hand. Following the tactics which were afterwards repeated many times in the Peninsula, the Lorraine regiment, forming a column twelve deep, advanced against that of Coote, which received them in line. The French came on at the double. When within a distance of fifty yards, Coote's regiment poured a volley into the front and flanks of the column. Although they suffered heavily from this fire, the French bravely pressed on with levelled bayonets, and the head of the column, by sheer weight, broke through the English line.",musketry fire begin o'clock accord order retain enemy come hand follow tactic repeat many time regiment form column deep advance receive line come double distance yard regiment pour volley front flank column suffer fire press levell bayonet head column sheer weight break english line 
42,"The flanks of the English, however, closed in on the sides of the French column, and a desperate hand-to-hand fight ensued. In this, the English had all the advantage, attacking the French fiercely on either side, until the latter broke and ran back to the camp.",flank close side french column desperate hand hand fight ensue have advantage attack side latter break run camp 
43,"Colonel Coote, who was with his regiment, ordered it to form in regular order again, before it advanced, and rode off to see what was going on in the rest of the line. As he was passing on, a shot struck an ammunition waggon in the intrenched tank held by the French. This exploded, killing and wounding eighty men, among whom was the commander of the post. The rest of its occupants, panic stricken by the explosion, ran back to the next tank. Their panic communicated itself to the Sepoys there, and all ran back together to the camp.",regiment order form regular order advance ride see go rest line pass shot strike ammunition waggon intrenched tank hold explode kill wound man commander post rest occupant panic stricken explosion run next tank panic communicate run camp 
44,"Colonel Coote at once sent orders to Major Brereton, who commanded Draper's regiment, to take possession of the tank, before the enemy recovered from the confusion which the explosion would be sure to cause. The ground opposite that which Draper's regiment occupied was held by Lally's regiment, and in order to prevent his men being exposed to a flanking fire from these, Draper ordered them to file off to the right. Bussy, who commanded at this wing, endeavoured to rally the fugitives, and gathering fifty or sixty together, added two companies of Lally's regiment to them, and posted them in the tank; he then returned to the regiment.",send order command regiment take possession tank enemy recover confusion explosion sure cause ground regiment occupy hold regiment order prevent man expose flank fire order file right command wing endeavour rally fugitive gather add company regiment post tank return regiment 
45,"As Major Brereton, moving up his men, reached the intrenchment, a heavy fire was poured upon him. Major Brereton fell, mortally wounded, and many of his men were killed. The rest, however, with a rush carried the intrenchment, and firing down from the parapet on the guns on Lally's left, drove the gunners from them. Two companies held the intrenchment, and the rest formed in the plain on its left, to prevent Lally's regiment attacking it on this side.",move man reach intrenchment heavy fire pour fall wound many man kill rest rush carry intrenchment fire parapet gun left drive gunner company hold intrenchment rest form plain left prevent regiment attack side 
46,"Bussy wheeled Lally's regiment, detached a portion of it to recover the intrenchment, and with the rest marched against Draper's troops in the plain. A heavy musketry fire was kept up on both sides, until the two guns, posted by Draper's regiment, and left behind when they attacked the intrenchment, came up and opened on the French. These began to waver. Bussy, as the only chance of gaining the day, put himself at their head, and endeavoured to lead them forward to attack the English with the bayonet. His horse, however, was struck with a ball and soon fell; the English fire was redoubled, and but twenty of Lally's men kept round him.",wheel regiment detach portion recover intrenchment rest march troops plain heavy musketry fire keep side gun post regiment leave attack intrenchment come open begin waver only chance gain day put head endeavour lead attack bayonet horse strike ball fall english fire redoubl man keep 
47,"Two companies of the English rushed forward and surrounded the little party, who at once surrendered. Bussy was led a prisoner to the rear, and as he went was surprised at the sight of the three hundred grenadiers, the best troops in the English army, remaining quietly in reserve.",company rush surround little party surrender lead prisoner rear go surprise sight grenadier good troops english army remain reserve 
48,"While on either flank the French were now beaten, the fight in the centre, between the European troops of the English and French Companies, had continued, but had been confined to a hot musketry and artillery fire. But upon seeing the defeat of their flanks, the enemy's centre likewise fell back to their camp.",flank beat fight centre european troops english french continue confine hot musketry artillery fire see defeat flank enemy centre fall camp 
49,"From the moment when the Lorraine regiment had been routed, four field pieces kept up an incessant fire into their camp, to prevent them from rallying. The three English regiments now advanced in line, and entered the enemy's camp without the least opposition. The Lorraine regiment had passed through it, a mass of fugitives. The India regiment and Lally's went through rapidly, but in good order.",moment regiment rout field piece keep incessant fire camp prevent rallying english regiment advance line enter enemy camp least opposition regiment pass mass fugitive regiment go good order 
50,"Lally had, in vain, endeavoured to bring the Sepoys forward to the attack, to restore the day. The French cavalry, seeing the defeat of Lorraine's regiment, advanced to cover it, their appearance completely intimidating the English irregular horse. Charlie's troop were too weak to charge them single handed.",vain endeavour bring attack restore day french cavalry see defeat regiment advance cover appearance intimidate english irregular horse troop weak charge single handed 
51,"Reanimated by the attitude of their cavalry, the men of the Lorraine regiment rallied, yoked up four field pieces which were standing in the rear of the camp, and moved off in fair order. They were joined in the plain by Lally's regiment and the India battalion, and the whole, setting fire to their tents, moved off in good order. The four field pieces kept in the rear, and behind these moved the cavalry. As they retired, they were joined by the four hundred and fifty men from the batteries opposite Vandivash.",reanimate attitude cavalry man regiment rally yoke field piece stand rear camp move fair order join plain regiment battalion whole set fire tent move good order field piece keep rear move cavalry retire join man battery 
52,"Colonel Coote sent orders to his cavalry to harass the enemy. These followed them for five miles, but as the native horse would not venture within range of the enemy's field guns, Charlie, to his great disappointment, was able to do nothing.",send order cavalry harass enemy follow mile native horse venture range enemy field gun great disappointment able do 
53,"Upon neither side did the Sepoys take any part in the battle of Vandivash. It was fought entirely between the two thousand two hundred and fifty French, not including those in their battery, and sixteen hundred English, excluding the grenadiers, who never fired a shot. Twenty-four pieces of cannon were taken, and eleven waggons of ammunition, and all the tents, stores, and baggage that were not burned. The French left two hundred dead upon the field. A hundred and sixty were taken prisoners, of whom thirty died of their wounds before the next morning. Large numbers dropped upon the march, and were afterwards captured. The English had sixty-three killed, and a hundred and twenty-four wounded.",side take part battle fight french include battery exclude grenadier fire shot piece cannon take waggon ammunition tent store baggage burn leave dead field take prisoner die wound next morning large number drop march capture have kill wound 
54,"The news of this victory reached Madras on the following morning, and excited as much enthusiastic joy as that of Plassey had done at Calcutta; and the event was almost as important a one. There was no longer the slightest fear of danger, and the Madras authorities began to meditate an attack upon Pondicherry. So long as the great French settlement remained intact, so long would Madras be exposed to fresh invasions; and it was certain that France, driven now from Bengal, would make a desperate effort to regain her shaken supremacy in Madras.",news victory reach follow morning excite much enthusiastic joy do event important one be slight fear danger authority begin meditate attack great french settlement remain intact expose fresh invasion certain drive make desperate effort regain shake supremacy 
55,"The force, however, at the disposal of the Madras authorities, was still far too weak to enable them to undertake an enterprise like the siege of Pondicherry; for their army did not exceed, in numbers, that which Lally possessed for its defence. Accordingly, urgent letters were sent to Clive to ask him to send down, in the summer, as many troops as he could spare, other reinforcements being expected from England at that time. The intervening time was spent in the reduction of Chittapett, Karical, and many other forts which held out for the French.",force disposal authority weak enable undertake enterprise siege army exceed number possess defence urgent letter send ask send summer many troops spare other reinforcement expect time intervene time spend reduction many other fort hold 
56,"After the battle of Vandivash, Charlie kept his promise to his men. He represented to Mr. Pigot that they had already served some months over the time for which they were enlisted, that they had gone through great hardships, and performed great services, and that they were now anxious to retire to enjoy the prize money they had earned. He added that he had given his own promise that they should be allowed to retire, if they would extend their service until after a decisive battle with the French. Mr. Pigot at once assented to Charlie's request, and ordered that a batta of six months' pay should be given to each man, upon leaving.",battle keep promise man represent serve month time enlist go great hardship perform great service anxious retire enjoy prize money earn add give own promise allow retire extend service decisive battle assent request order batta month pay give man leave 
57,"The troop, joined by many of their comrades, who had been at different times sent down sick and wounded to Madras, formed up there on parade for the last time. They responded with three hearty cheers to the address which Charlie gave them, thanking them for their services, bidding them farewell, and hoping that they would long enjoy the prize money which they had gallantly won. Then they delivered over their horses to the authorities, drew their prize money from the treasury, and started for their respective homes, the English portion taking up their quarters in barracks, until the next ship should sail for England.",troop join many comrade different time send sick wound form parade last time respond hearty cheer address give thank service bid farewell hope enjoy prize money win deliver horse authority draw prize money treasury start respective home english portion take quarter barrack next ship sail 
58,"""I am sorry to leave them,"" Charlie said to Peters, as they stood alone upon the parade. ""We have gone through a lot of stirring work together, and no fellows could have behaved better.""",sorry leave say stand parade go lot stir work fellow behave good 
59,"""No,"" Peters agreed. ""It is singular that, contemptible as are these natives of India when officered by men of their own race and religion, they will fight to the death when led by us.""",agree singular contemptible native officer man own race religion fight death lead
