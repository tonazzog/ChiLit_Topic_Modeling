1,CHAPTER XXIII. THE EARLY BIRD,early bird 
2," WHEN Diamond got home he found his father at home already, sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable, for his head ached and he felt sick. He had been doing night work of late, and it had not agreed with him, so he had given it up, but not in time, for he had taken some kind of fever. The next day he was forced to keep his bed, and his wife nursed him, and Diamond attended to the baby. If he had not been ill, it would have been delightful to have him at home; and the first day Diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby, and his father listened with some pleasure. But the next he could not bear even Diamond’s sweet voice, and was very ill indeed; so Diamond took the baby into his own room, and had no end of quiet games with him there. If he did pull all his bedding on the floor, it did not matter, for he kept baby very quiet, and made the bed himself again, and slept in it with baby all the next night, and many nights after.",get find father home sit fire look miserable head ach feel sick do night work agree give time take kind fever next day force keep bed wife nurse attend baby ill delightful have home first day sing more song baby father listen pleasure next bear sweet voice ill take baby own room have end quiet game pull bedding floor matter keep baby quiet make bed sleep baby next night many night 
3,"But long before his father got well, his mother’s savings were all but gone. She did not say a word about it in the hearing of her husband, lest she should distress him; and one night, when she could not help crying, she came into Diamond’s room that his father might not hear her. She thought Diamond was asleep, but he was not. When he heard her sobbing, he was frightened, and said--",father get mother savings gone say word hearing husband distress night help cry come room father hear think asleep hear sobbing frighten say

11,"            A little bird sat on the edge of her nest;                Her yellow-beaks slept as sound as tops;             That day she had done her very best,                And had filled every one of their little crops.             She had filled her own just over-full,                And hence she was feeling a little dull.",little bird sit edge nest yellow beak sleep sound top day do good fill one little crop fill own full feel little dull 
12,"            “Oh, dear!” she sighed, as she sat with her head                Sunk in her chest, and no neck at all,             While her crop stuck out like a feather bed                Turned inside out, and rather small;             “What shall I do if things don’t reform?             I don’t know where there’s a single worm.",dear sigh sit head sunk chest neck crop stick feather bed turn small do thing reform know be single worm 
13,"            “I’ve had twenty to-day, and the children five each,                Besides a few flies, and some very fat spiders:             No one will say I don’t do as I preach--                I’m one of the best of bird-providers;             But where’s the use?  We want a storm--                I don’t know where there’s a single worm.”",have day child few fly fat spider say do preach good bird provider use want storm know be single worm 
14,"            “There’s five in my crop,” said a wee, wee bird,                Which woke at the voice of his mother’s pain;             “I know where there’s five.” And with the word                He tucked in his head, and went off again.             “The folly of childhood,” sighed his mother,             “Has always been my especial bother.”",be crop say wee wee bird wake voice mother pain know be word tuck head go folly childhood sigh mother especial bother 
15,"            The yellow-beaks they slept on and on--                They never had heard of the bogy To-morrow;             But the mother sat outside, making her moan--                She’ll soon have to beg, or steal, or borrow.             For she never can tell the night before,             Where she shall find one red worm more.",yellow beak sleep hear bogy to-morrow mother sit make moan have beg steal borrow tell night find red worm more 
16,"            The fact, as I say, was, she’d had too many;                She couldn’t sleep, and she called it virtue,             Motherly foresight, affection, any                Name you may call it that will not hurt you,             So it was late ere she tucked her head in,             And she slept so late it was almost a sin.",fact say have many sleep call virtue motherly foresight affection name call hurt late tuck head sleep sin 
17,"            But the little fellow who knew of five                Nor troubled his head about any more,             Woke very early, felt quite alive,                And wanted a sixth to add to his store:             He pushed his mother, the greedy elf,             Then thought he had better try for himself.",little fellow know trouble head more woke feel alive want sixth add store push mother greedy elf think have good try 
18,"            When his mother awoke and had rubbed her eyes,                Feeling less like a bird, and more like a mole,             She saw him--fancy with what surprise--                Dragging a huge worm out of a hole!             ‘Twas of this same hero the proverb took form:             ‘Tis the early bird that catches the worm.",mother awoke rub eye feel less bird mole see fancy surprise dragg huge worm hole twa same hero proverb take form early bird catch worm
