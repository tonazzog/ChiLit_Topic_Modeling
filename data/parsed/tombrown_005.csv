3,"“And so here’s Rugby, sir, at last, and you’ll be in plenty of time for dinner at the School-house, as I telled you,” said the old guard, pulling his horn out of its case and tootle-tooing away, while the coachman shook up his horses, and carried them along the side of the school close, round Dead-man’s corner, past the school-gates, and down the High Street to the Spread Eagle, the wheelers in a spanking trot, and leaders cantering, in a style which would not have disgraced “Cherry Bob,” “ramping, stamping, tearing, swearing Billy Harwood,” or any other of the old coaching heroes.",last plenty time dinner house tell say old guard pull horn case tootle too coachman shake horse carry side school close dead man corner school gate high wheeler spanking trot leader canter style disgrace ramp stamp tear swear other old coaching hero 
4,"Tom’s heart beat quick as he passed the great schoolfield or close, with its noble elms, in which several games at football were going on, and tried to take in at once the long line of gray buildings, beginning with the chapel, and ending with the School-house, the residence of the head-master, where the great flag was lazily waving from the highest round tower. And he began already to be proud of being a Rugby boy, as he passed the schoolgates, with the oriel window above, and saw the boys standing there, looking as if the town belonged to them, and nodding in a familiar manner to the coachman, as if any one of them would be quite equal to getting on the box, and working the team down street as well as he.",heart beat pass great schoolfield close noble elm several game football go try take long line gray building begin chapel end house residence head master great flag wave high round tower begin proud boy pass schoolgate oriel window see boy stand look town belong nodd familiar manner coachman one equal get box work team street 
5,"One of the young heroes, however, ran out from the rest, and scrambled up behind; where, having righted himself, and nodded to the guard, with “How do, Jem?” he turned short round to Tom, and after looking him over for a minute, began,--",young hero run rest scramble right nod guard turn short look minute begin 
6,"“I say, you fellow, is your name Brown?”",say fellow name 
7,"“Yes,” said Tom, in considerable astonishment, glad, however, to have lighted on some one already who seemed to know him.",say considerable astonishment glad light one seem know

9,"Tom was somewhat inclined to resent the patronizing air of his new friend, a boy of just about his own height and age, but gifted with the most transcendent coolness and assurance, which Tom felt to be aggravating and hard to bear, but couldn’t for the life of him help admiring and envying--especially when young my lord begins hectoring two or three long loafing fellows, half porter, half stableman, with a strong touch of the blackguard, and in the end arranges with one of them, nicknamed Cooey, to carry Tom’s luggage up to the School-house for sixpence.",inclined resent patronizing air new friend boy own height age gift transcendent coolness assurance feel aggravating hard bear life help admire envy young lord begin hector long loafing fellow half porter half stableman strong touch blackguard end arrange nickname carry luggage house sixpence 
10,"“And hark ‘ee, Cooey; it must be up in ten minutes, or no more jobs from me. Come along, Brown.” And away swaggers the young potentate, with his hands in his pockets, and Tom at his side.",hark minute more job come swagger young potentate hand pocket side 
11,"“All right, sir,” says Cooey, touching his hat, with a leer and a wink at his companions.",right sir say touch hat leer wink companion 
12,"“Hullo though,” says East, pulling up, and taking another look at Tom; “this’ll never do. Haven’t you got a hat? We never wear caps here. Only the louts wear caps. Bless you, if you were to go into the quadrangle with that thing on, I don’t know what’d happen.” The very idea was quite beyond young Master East, and he looked unutterable things.",say pull take look do get hat wear cap lout wear cap bless go quadrangle thing know happen very idea young look unutterable thing 
13,"Tom thought his cap a very knowing affair, but confessed that he had a hat in his hat-box; which was accordingly at once extracted from the hind-boot, and Tom equipped in his go-to-meeting roof, as his new friend called it. But this didn’t quite suit his fastidious taste in another minute, being too shiny; so, as they walk up the town, they dive into Nixon’s the hatter’s, and Tom is arrayed, to his utter astonishment, and without paying for it, in a regulation cat-skin at seven-and-sixpence, Nixon undertaking to send the best hat up to the matron’s room, School-house, in half an hour.",think cap know affair confess have hat hat box extract hind boot equip go meeting roof new friend call suit fastidious taste minute shiny walk town dive hatter array utter astonishment pay regulation cat skin undertaking send good hat matron room school house hour

15,"Tom by this time began to be conscious of his new social position and dignities, and to luxuriate in the realized ambition of being a public school-boy at last, with a vested right of spoiling two seven-and-sixers in half a year.",time begin conscious new social position dignity luxuriate realize ambition public school boy last vested right spoil sixer year 
16,"“You see,” said his friend, as they strolled up towards the school-gates, in explanation of his conduct, “a great deal depends on how a fellow cuts up at first. If he’s got nothing odd about him, and answers straightforward, and holds his head up, he gets on. Now, you’ll do very well as to rig, all but that cap. You see I’m doing the handsome thing by you, because my father knows yours; besides, I want to please the old lady. She gave me half a sov. this half, and perhaps’ll double it next, if I keep in her good books.”",see say friend stroll school gate explanation conduct great deal depend fellow cut first get odd answer straightforward hold head get do rig cap see do handsome thing father know want please old lady give sov. half double keep good book 
17,"There’s nothing for candour like a lower-school boy, and East was a genuine specimen--frank, hearty, and good-natured, well-satisfied with himself and his position, and choke-full of life and spirits, and all the Rugby prejudices and traditions which he had been able to get together in the long course of one half-year during which he had been at the School-house.",be candour low school boy genuine specimen frank hearty good natured satisfied position choke full life spirit prejudice tradition able get long course half year house 
18,"And Tom, notwithstanding his bumptiousness, felt friends with him at once, and began sucking in all his ways and prejudices, as fast as he could understand them.",notwithstand bumptiousness feel friend begin suck way prejudice understand 
19,"East was great in the character of cicerone. He carried Tom through the great gates, where were only two or three boys. These satisfied themselves with the stock questions, “You fellow, what’s your name? Where do you come from? How old are you? Where do you board?” and, “What form are you in?” And so they passed on through the quadrangle and a small courtyard, upon which looked down a lot of little windows (belonging, as his guide informed him, to some of the School-house studies), into the matron’s room, where East introduced Tom to that dignitary; made him give up the key of his trunk, that the matron might unpack his linen, and told the story of the hat and of his own presence of mind: upon the relation whereof the matron laughingly scolded him for the coolest new boy in the house; and East, indignant at the accusation of newness, marched Tom off into the quadrangle, and began showing him the schools, and examining him as to his literary attainments; the result of which was a prophecy that they would be in the same form, and could do their lessons together.",great character cicerone carry great gate boy satisfy stock question fellow name come old board form pass quadrangle small courtyard look lot little window belong guide inform house study matron room introduce dignitary make give key trunk matron unpack linen tell story hat own presence mind relation matron scold coolest new boy house indignant accusation newness march quadrangle begin show school examine literary attainment result prophecy same form do lesson 
20,"“And now come in and see my study--we shall have just time before dinner; and afterwards, before calling over, we’ll do the close.”",come see study have time dinner call do close 
21,"Tom followed his guide through the School-house hall, which opens into the quadrangle. It is a great room, thirty feet long and eighteen high, or thereabouts, with two great tables running the whole length, and two large fireplaces at the side, with blazing fires in them, at one of which some dozen boys were standing and lounging, some of whom shouted to East to stop; but he shot through with his convoy, and landed him in the long, dark passages, with a large fire at the end of each, upon which the studies opened. Into one of these, in the bottom passage, East bolted with our hero, slamming and bolting the door behind them, in case of pursuit from the hall, and Tom was for the first time in a Rugby boy’s citadel.",follow guide house hall open quadrangle great room foot long high great table run whole length large fireplace side blaze fire boy stand loung shout stop shoot convoy land long dark passage large fire end study open bottom passage bolt hero slamm bolt door case pursuit hall first time boy citadel 
22,"He hadn’t been prepared for separate studies, and was not a little astonished and delighted with the palace in question.",prepare separate study little astonished delighted palace question 
23,"It wasn’t very large, certainly, being about six feet long by four broad. It couldn’t be called light, as there were bars and a grating to the window; which little precautions were necessary in the studies on the ground-floor looking out into the close, to prevent the exit of small boys after locking up, and the entrance of contraband articles. But it was uncommonly comfortable to look at, Tom thought. The space under the window at the farther end was occupied by a square table covered with a reasonably clean and whole red and blue check tablecloth; a hard-seated sofa covered with red stuff occupied one side, running up to the end, and making a seat for one, or by sitting close, for two, at the table and a good stout wooden chair afforded a seat to another boy, so that three could sit and work together. The walls were wainscoted half-way up, the wainscot being covered with green baize, the remainder with a bright-patterned paper, on which hung three or four prints of dogs’ heads; Grimaldi winning the Aylesbury steeple-chase; Amy Robsart, the reigning Waverley beauty of the day; and Tom Crib, in a posture of defence, which did no credit to the science of that hero, if truly represented. Over the door were a row of hat-pegs, and on each side bookcases with cupboards at the bottom, shelves and cupboards being filled indiscriminately with school-books, a cup or two, a mouse-trap and candlesticks, leather straps, a fustian bag, and some curious-looking articles which puzzled Tom not a little, until his friend explained that they were climbing-irons, and showed their use. A cricket-bat and small fishing-rod stood up in one corner.",large foot call light be bar grating window little precaution necessary study ground floor look close prevent exit small boy lock entrance contraband article comfortable look think space window far end occupy square table cover clean whole red blue check tablecloth hard seat sofa cover red stuff occupy side run end make seat sit close table good stout wooden chair afford seat boy sit work wall wainscot half way wainscot cover green baize remainder bright pattern paper hang print dog head win steeple chase reign beauty day posture defence do credit science hero represent door row hat peg side bookcase cupboard bottom shelf cupboard fill school book cup mouse trap candlestick leather strap fustian bag curious look article puzzle little friend explain climb iron show use cricket bat small fishing rod stand corner 
24,"This was the residence of East and another boy in the same form, and had more interest for Tom than Windsor Castle, or any other residence in the British Isles. For was he not about to become the joint owner of a similar home, the first place he could call his own? One’s own! What a charm there is in the words! How long it takes boy and man to find out their worth! How fast most of us hold on to them--faster and more jealously, the nearer we are to that general home into which we can take nothing, but must go naked as we came into the world! When shall we learn that he who multiplieth possessions multiplieth troubles, and that the one single use of things which we call our own is that they may be his who hath need of them?",residence boy same form have more interest other residence british about become joint owner similar home first place call own own charm be word take boy man find worth most hold fast nearer general home take go naked come world learn multiplieth possession multiplieth trouble single use thing call own have need

27,“What nice places!”,nice place 
28,"“They’re well enough,” answered East, patronizingly, “only uncommon cold at nights sometimes. Gower--that’s my chum--and I make a fire with paper on the floor after supper generally, only that makes it so smoky.”",answer uncommon cold night chum make fire paper floor supper make smoky 
29,"“But there’s a big fire out in the passage,” said Tom.",be big fire passage say 
30,"“Precious little we get out of that, though,” said East. “Jones the praepostor has the study at the fire end, and he has rigged up an iron rod and green baize curtain across the passage, which he draws at night, and sits there with his door open; so he gets all the fire, and hears if we come out of our studies after eight, or make a noise. However, he’s taken to sitting in the fifth-form room lately, so we do get a bit of fire now sometimes; only to keep a sharp lookout that he don’t catch you behind his curtain when he comes down--that’s all.”",precious little get say praepostor have study fire end rig iron rod green baize curtain passage draw night sit door open get fire hear come study make noise take sit fifth form room get bit fire keep sharp lookout catch curtain come 
31,"A quarter past one now struck, and the bell began tolling for dinner; so they went into the hall and took their places, Tom at the very bottom of the second table, next to the praepostor (who sat at the end to keep order there), and East a few paces higher. And now Tom for the first time saw his future school-fellows in a body. In they came, some hot and ruddy from football or long walks, some pale and chilly from hard reading in their studies, some from loitering over the fire at the pastrycook’s, dainty mortals, bringing with them pickles and saucebottles to help them with their dinners. And a great big-bearded man, whom Tom took for a master, began calling over the names, while the great joints were being rapidly carved on the third table in the corner by the old verger and the housekeeper. Tom’s turn came last, and meanwhile he was all eyes, looking first with awe at the great man, who sat close to him, and was helped first, and who read a hard-looking book all the time he was eating; and when he got up and walked off to the fire, at the small boys round him, some of whom were reading, and the rest talking in whispers to one another, or stealing one another’s bread, or shooting pellets, or digging their forks through the tablecloth. However, notwithstanding his curiosity, he managed to make a capital dinner by the time the big man called “Stand up!” and said grace.",quarter past one strike bell begin toll dinner go hall take place very bottom second table praepostor sit end keep order few pace high first time see future school fellow body come hot ruddy football long walk pale chilly hard reading study loiter fire pastrycook dainty mortal bring pickle saucebottle help dinner great big bearded man take master begin call name great joint carve third table corner old verger housekeeper turn come last eye look awe great man sit help read hard look book time eat get walk fire small boy read rest talk whisper steal bread shoot pellet digg fork tablecloth notwithstand curiosity manage make capital dinner time big man call stand say grace 
32,"As soon as dinner was over, and Tom had been questioned by such of his neighbours as were curious as to his birth, parentage, education, and other like matters, East, who evidently enjoyed his new dignity of patron and mentor, proposed having a look at the close, which Tom, athirst for knowledge, gladly assented to; and they went out through the quadrangle and past the big fives court, into the great playground.",dinner question such neighbour curious birth parentage education other like matter enjoy new dignity patron mentor propose have look close athirst knowledge assent go quadrangle big fives court great playground 
33,"“That’s the chapel, you see,” said East; “and there, just behind it, is the place for fights. You see it’s most out of the way of the masters, who all live on the other side, and don’t come by here after first lesson or callings-over. That’s when the fights come off. And all this part where we are is the little-side ground, right up to the trees; and on the other side of the trees is the big-side ground, where the great matches are played. And there’s the island in the farthest corner; you’ll know that well enough next half, when there’s island fagging. I say, it’s horrid cold; let’s have a run across.” And away went East, Tom close behind him. East was evidently putting his best foot foremost; and Tom, who was mighty proud of his running, and not a little anxious to show his friend that, although a new boy, he was no milksop, laid himself down to work in his very best style. Right across the close they went, each doing all he knew, and there wasn’t a yard between them when they pulled up at the island moat.",chapel see say place fight see most way master live other side come first lesson calling fight come part little side ground tree other side tree big side ground great match play be island farthest corner know enough next half be island fagging say horrid cold let have run go close put good foot proud running little anxious show friend new boy milksop lay work good style close go do know be yard pull island moat

35,“But why do you wear white trousers in November?” said Tom. He had been struck by this peculiarity in the costume of almost all the School-house boys.,wear white trousers say strike peculiarity costume school house boy 
36,"“Why, bless us, don’t you know? No; I forgot. Why, to-day’s the School-house match. Our house plays the whole of the School at football. And we all wear white trousers, to show ‘em we don’t care for hacks. You’re in luck to come to-day. You just will see a match; and Brooke’s going to let me play in quarters. That’s more than he’ll do for any other lower-school boy, except James, and he’s fourteen.”",bless know forget day house match house play whole football wear white trousers show care hack luck come day see match go let play quarter more do other low school boy 
37,“Who’s Brooke?”,
38,"“Why, that big fellow who called over at dinner, to be sure. He’s cock of the school, and head of the School-house side, and the best kick and charger in Rugby.”",big fellow call dinner sure cock school head house side good kick charge 
39,"“Oh, but do show me where they play. And tell me about it. I love football so, and have played all my life. Won’t Brooke let me play?”",show play tell love football play life let play 
40,"“Not he,” said East, with some indignation. “Why, you don’t know the rules; you’ll be a month learning them. And then it’s no joke playing-up in a match, I can tell you--quite another thing from your private school games. Why, there’s been two collar-bones broken this half, and a dozen fellows lamed. And last year a fellow had his leg broken.”",say indignation know rule month learn joke play match tell thing private school game be collar bone break half fellow lame last year fellow have leg break 
41,"Tom listened with the profoundest respect to this chapter of accidents, and followed East across the level ground till they came to a sort of gigantic gallows of two poles, eighteen feet high, fixed upright in the ground some fourteen feet apart, with a cross-bar running from one to the other at the height of ten feet or thereabouts.",listen profoundest respect chapter accident follow level ground come sort gigantic gallow pole foot high fix ground foot cross bar run other height foot 
42,"“This is one of the goals,” said East, “and you see the other, across there, right opposite, under the Doctor’s wall. Well, the match is for the best of three goals; whichever side kicks two goals wins: and it won’t do, you see, just to kick the ball through these posts--it must go over the cross-bar; any height’ll do, so long as it’s between the posts. You’ll have to stay in goal to touch the ball when it rolls behind the posts, because if the other side touch it they have a try at goal. Then we fellows in quarters, we play just about in front of goal here, and have to turn the ball and kick it back before the big fellows on the other side can follow it up. And in front of us all the big fellows play, and that’s where the scrummages are mostly.”",goal say see other opposite wall match good goal side kick goal win do see kick ball post go cross-bar height do post have stay goal touch ball roll post other side touch have try goal fellow quarter play front goal have turn ball kick big fellow other side follow front big fellow play scrummage 
43,"Tom’s respect increased as he struggled to make out his friend’s technicalities, and the other set to work to explain the mysteries of “off your side,” “drop-kicks,” “punts,” “places,” and the other intricacies of the great science of football.",respect increase struggle make friend technicality other set work explain mystery side drop kick punt place other intricacy great science football 
44,“But how do you keep the ball between the goals?” said he; “I can’t see why it mightn’t go right down to the chapel.”,keep ball goal say see go chapel 
45,"“Why; that’s out of play,” answered East. “You see this gravel-walk running down all along this side of the playing-ground, and the line of elms opposite on the other? Well, they’re the bounds. As soon as the ball gets past them, it’s in touch, and out of play. And then whoever first touches it has to knock it straight out amongst the players-up, who make two lines with a space between them, every fellow going on his own side. Ain’t there just fine scrummages then! And the three trees you see there which come out into the play, that’s a tremendous place when the ball hangs there, for you get thrown against the trees, and that’s worse than any hack.”",play answer see gravel walk run side playing ground line elm other bound ball get touch play first touch have knock player make line space fellow go own side ai fine scrummage tree see come play tremendous place ball hang throw tree bad hack 
46,"Tom wondered within himself, as they strolled back again towards the fives court, whether the matches were really such break-neck affairs as East represented, and whether, if they were, he should ever get to like them and play up well.",wonder stroll fives court match such break neck affair represent get like play 
47,"He hadn’t long to wonder, however, for next minute East cried out, “Hurrah! here’s the punt-about; come along and try your hand at a kick.”  The punt-about is the practice-ball, which is just brought out and kicked about anyhow from one boy to another before callings-over and dinner, and at other odd times. They joined the boys who had brought it out, all small School-house fellows, friends of East; and Tom had the pleasure of trying his skill, and performed very creditably, after first driving his foot three inches into the ground, and then nearly kicking his leg into the air, in vigorous efforts to accomplish a drop-kick after the manner of East.",long wonder next minute cry punt come try hand kick punt practice ball bring kick boy calling dinner other odd time join boy bring small school house fellow friend have pleasure try skill perform drive foot inch ground kick leg air vigorous effort accomplish drop kick manner 
48,"Presently more boys and bigger came out, and boys from other houses on their way to calling-over, and more balls were sent for. The crowd thickened as three o’clock approached; and when the hour struck, one hundred and fifty boys were hard at work. Then the balls were held, the master of the week came down in cap and gown to calling-over, and the whole school of three hundred boys swept into the big school to answer to their names.",more boy big come boy other house way calling more ball send crowd thicken o'clock approach hour strike boy hard work ball hold master week come cap gown calling whole school boy sweep big school answer name 
49,"“I may come in, mayn’t I?” said Tom, catching East by the arm, and longing to feel one of them.",come say catching arm long feel 
50,"“Yes, come along; nobody’ll say anything. You won’t be so eager to get into calling-over after a month,” replied his friend; and they marched into the big school together, and up to the farther end, where that illustrious form, the lower fourth, which had the honour of East’s patronage for the time being, stood.",come say eager get calling month reply friend march big school far end illustrious form low fourth have honour patronage time being stand 
51,"The master mounted into the high desk by the door, and one of the praepostors of the week stood by him on the steps, the other three marching up and down the middle of the school with their canes, calling out, “Silence, silence!” The sixth form stood close by the door on the left, some thirty in number, mostly great big grown men, as Tom thought, surveying them from a distance with awe; the fifth form behind them, twice their number, and not quite so big. These on the left; and on the right the lower fifth, shell, and all the junior forms in order; while up the middle marched the three praepostors.",master mount high desk door praepostor week stand step other march middle school cane call silence silence sixth form stand door left number great big grow man think survey distance awe fifth form number big left right low fifth shell junior form order middle march praepostor 
52,"Then the praepostor who stands by the master calls out the names, beginning with the sixth form; and as he calls each boy answers “here”  to his name, and walks out. Some of the sixth stop at the door to turn the whole string of boys into the close. It is a great match-day, and every boy in the school, will he, nill he, must be there. The rest of the sixth go forwards into the close, to see that no one escapes by any of the side gates.",praepostor stand master call name begin sixth form call boy answer name walk sixth stop door turn whole string boy close great match day boy school rest sixth go forward close see escape side gate 
53,"To-day, however, being the School-house match, none of the School-house praepostors stay by the door to watch for truants of their side; there is carte blanche to the School-house fags to go where they like. “They trust to our honour,” as East proudly informs Tom; “they know very well that no School-house boy would cut the match. If he did, we’d very soon cut him, I can tell you.”",day school house match house praepostor stay door watch truant side be carte blanche school house fag go like trust honour inform know school house boy cut match cut tell 
54,"The master of the week being short-sighted, and the praepostors of the week small and not well up to their work, the lower-school boys employ the ten minutes which elapse before their names are called in pelting one another vigorously with acorns, which fly about in all directions. The small praepostors dash in every now and then, and generally chastise some quiet, timid boy who is equally afraid of acorns and canes, while the principal performers get dexterously out of the way. And so calling-over rolls on somehow, much like the big world, punishments lighting on wrong shoulders, and matters going generally in a queer, cross-grained way, but the end coming somehow, which is, after all, the great point. And now the master of the week has finished, and locked up the big school; and the praepostors of the week come out, sweeping the last remnant of the school fags, who had been loafing about the corners by the fives court, in hopes of a chance of bolting, before them into the close.",master week short sight praepostor week small work low school boy employ minute elapse name call pelt acorn fly direction small praepostor dash chastise quiet timid boy afraid acorn cane principal performer get way calling roll big world punishment light wrong shoulder matter go queer cross grain way end come great point master week finish lock big school praepostor week come sweep last remnant school fag loaf corner fives court hope chance bolt close 
55,"“Hold the punt-about!” “To the goals!” are the cries; and all stray balls are impounded by the authorities, and the whole mass of boys moves up towards the two goals, dividing as they go into three bodies. That little band on the left, consisting of from fifteen to twenty boys, Tom amongst them, who are making for the goal under the School-house wall, are the School-house boys who are not to play up, and have to stay in goal. The larger body moving to the island goal are the School boys in a like predicament. The great mass in the middle are the players-up, both sides mingled together; they are hanging their jackets (and all who mean real work), their hats, waistcoats, neck-handkerchiefs, and braces, on the railings round the small trees; and there they go by twos and threes up to their respective grounds. There is none of the colour and tastiness of get-up, you will perceive, which lends such a life to the present game at Rugby, making the dullest and worst-fought match a pretty sight. Now each house has its own uniform of cap and jersey, of some lively colour; but at the time we are speaking of plush caps have not yet come in, or uniforms of any sort, except the School-house white trousers, which are abominably cold to-day. Let us get to work, bare-headed, and girded with our plain leather straps. But we mean business, gentlemen.",hold punt goal cry stray ball impound authority whole mass boy move goal divide go body little band left consist boy make goal house wall house boy play have stay goal large body move island goal school boy like predicament great mass middle player side mingle hang jacket mean real work hat waistcoat neck handkerchief brace railing small tree go two three respective grounds be colour tastiness get perceive lend life present game make dullest bad fight match pretty sight house have own uniform cap jersey lively colour time speak plush cap come uniform sort house white trousers cold day let get work bare head gird plain leather strap mean business gentleman 
56,"And now that the two sides have fairly sundered, and each occupies its own ground, and we get a good look at them, what absurdity is this? You don’t mean to say that those fifty or sixty boys in white trousers, many of them quite small, are going to play that huge mass opposite? Indeed I do, gentlemen. They’re going to try, at any rate, and won’t make such a bad fight of it either, mark my word; for hasn’t old Brooke won the toss, with his lucky halfpenny, and got choice of goals and kick-off? The new ball you may see lie there quite by itself, in the middle, pointing towards the School or island goal; in another minute it will be well on its way there. Use that minute in remarking how the Schoolhouse side is drilled. You will see, in the first place, that the sixth-form boy, who has the charge of goal, has spread his force (the goalkeepers) so as to occupy the whole space behind the goal-posts, at distances of about five yards apart. A safe and well-kept goal is the foundation of all good play. Old Brooke is talking to the captain of quarters, and now he moves away. See how that youngster spreads his men (the light brigade) carefully over the ground, half-way between their own goal and the body of their own players-up (the heavy brigade). These again play in several bodies. There is young Brooke and the bull-dogs. Mark them well. They are the “fighting brigade,” the “die-hards,” larking about at leap-frog to keep themselves warm, and playing tricks on one another. And on each side of old Brooke, who is now standing in the middle of the ground and just going to kick off, you see a separate wing of players-up, each with a boy of acknowledged prowess to look to--here Warner, and there Hedge; but over all is old Brooke, absolute as he of Russia, but wisely and bravely ruling over willing and worshipping subjects, a true football king. His face is earnest and careful as he glances a last time over his array, but full of pluck and hope--the sort of look I hope to see in my general when I go out to fight.",side sunder occupy own ground get good look absurdity mean say boy white trousers many small go play huge mass opposite gentleman go try rate make bad fight mark word old win toss lucky halfpenny get choice goal kick new ball see lie middle point island goal minute way use minute remark side drill see first place sixth form boy have charge goal spread force goalkeeper occupy whole space goal post distance yard safe keep goal foundation good play old talk captain quarter move see youngster spread man light brigade ground half way own goal body own player heavy brigade play several body be young bull dog mark fighting brigade die hard lark leap frog keep warm play trick side old stand middle ground go kick see separate wing player boy acknowledge prowess look old absolute rule willing worshipp subject true football king face earnest careful glance last time array full pluck hope sort look hope see general go fight 
57,"The School side is not organized in the same way. The goal-keepers are all in lumps, anyhow and nohow; you can’t distinguish between the players-up and the boys in quarters, and there is divided leadership. But with such odds in strength and weight it must take more than that to hinder them from winning; and so their leaders seem to think, for they let the players-up manage themselves.",side organize same way goal keeper lump nohow distinguish player boy quarter be divide leadership such odd strength weight take more hinder win leader seem think let player manage 
58,"But now look! there is a slight move forward of the School-house wings, a shout of “Are you ready?” and loud affirmative reply. Old Brooke takes half a dozen quick steps, and away goes the ball spinning towards the School goal, seventy yards before it touches ground, and at no point above twelve or fifteen feet high, a model kick-off; and the School-house cheer and rush on. The ball is returned, and they meet it and drive it back amongst the masses of the School already in motion. Then the two sides close, and you can see nothing for minutes but a swaying crowd of boys, at one point violently agitated. That is where the ball is, and there are the keen players to be met, and the glory and the hard knocks to be got. You hear the dull thud, thud of the ball, and the shouts of “Off your side,” “Down with him,” “Put him over,” “Bravo.”  This is what we call “a scrummage,” gentlemen, and the first scrummage in a School-house match was no joke in the consulship of Plancus.",look be slight move school house wing shout ready loud affirmative reply old take quick step go ball spinn goal yard touch ground point foot high model kick house cheer rush ball return meet drive mass motion side close see minute sway crowd boy point agitate ball be keen player meet glory hard knock get hear dull thud thud ball shout side put call scrummage gentleman first scrummage house match joke consulship 
59,"But see! it has broken; the ball is driven out on the School-house side, and a rush of the School carries it past the School-house players-up. “Look out in quarters,” Brooke’s and twenty other voices ring out. No need to call, though: the School-house captain of quarters has caught it on the bound, dodges the foremost School boys, who are heading the rush, and sends it back with a good drop-kick well into the enemy’s country. And then follows rush upon rush, and scrummage upon scrummage, the ball now driven through into the School-house quarters, and now into the School goal; for the School-house have not lost the advantage which the kick-off and a slight wind gave them at the outset, and are slightly “penning” their adversaries. You say you don’t see much in it all--nothing but a struggling mass of boys, and a leather ball which seems to excite them all to great fury, as a red rag does a bull. My dear sir, a battle would look much the same to you, except that the boys would be men, and the balls iron; but a battle would be worth your looking at for all that, and so is a football match. You can’t be expected to appreciate the delicate strokes of play, the turns by which a game is lost and won--it takes an old player to do that; but the broad philosophy of football you can understand if you will. Come along with me a little nearer, and let us consider it together.",see break ball drive school house side rush carry house player look quarter other voice ring need call house captain quarter catch bind dodge foremost boy head rush send good drop kick enemy country follow rush rush scrummage scrummage ball drive school house quarter goal house lose advantage kick slight wind give outset penn adversary say see much struggle mass boy leather ball seem excite great fury red rag do bull dear sir battle look same boy man ball iron battle worth look football match expect appreciate delicate stroke play turn game lose win take old player do broad philosophy football understand come little nearer let consider 
60,"The ball has just fallen again where the two sides are thickest, and they close rapidly around it in a scrummage. It must be driven through now by force or skill, till it flies out on one side or the other. Look how differently the boys face it! Here come two of the bulldogs, bursting through the outsiders; in they go, straight to the heart of the scrummage, bent on driving that ball out on the opposite side. That is what they mean to do. My sons, my sons! you are too hot; you have gone past the ball, and must struggle now right through the scrummage, and get round and back again to your own side, before you can be of any further use. Here comes young Brooke; he goes in as straight as you, but keeps his head, and backs and bends, holding himself still behind the ball, and driving it furiously when he gets the chance. Take a leaf out of his book, you young chargers. Here comes Speedicut, and Flashman the School-house bully, with shouts and great action. Won’t you two come up to young Brooke, after locking-up, by the School-house fire, with “Old fellow, wasn’t that just a splendid scrummage by the three trees?” But he knows you, and so do we. You don’t really want to drive that ball through that scrummage, chancing all hurt for the glory of the School-house, but to make us think that’s what you want--a vastly different thing; and fellows of your kidney will never go through more than the skirts of a scrummage, where it’s all push and no kicking. We respect boys who keep out of it, and don’t sham going in; but you--we had rather not say what we think of you.",ball fall side thickest close scrummage drive force skill fly side other look boy face come bulldog burst outsider go heart scrummage bend drive ball opposite side mean do son son hot go ball struggle scrummage get own side further use come young go straight keep head back bend hold ball drive get chance take leaf book young charger come house bully shout great action come young lock house fire old fellow splendid scrummage tree know want drive ball scrummage chance hurt glory house make think want different thing fellow kidney go more skirt scrummage push kick respect boy keep sham go say think 
61,"Then the boys who are bending and watching on the outside, mark them: they are most useful players, the dodgers, who seize on the ball the moment it rolls out from amongst the chargers, and away with it across to the opposite goal. They seldom go into the scrummage, but must have more coolness than the chargers. As endless as are boys’ characters, so are their ways of facing or not facing a scrummage at football.",boy bending watch mark useful player dodger seize ball moment roll charger opposite goal go scrummage have more coolness charger endless boy character way face face scrummage football 
62,"Three-quarters of an hour are gone; first winds are failing, and weight and numbers beginning to tell. Yard by yard the School-house have been driven back, contesting every inch of ground. The bull-dogs are the colour of mother earth from shoulder to ankle, except young Brooke, who has a marvellous knack of keeping his legs. The School-house are being penned in their turn, and now the ball is behind their goal, under the Doctor’s wall. The Doctor and some of his family are there looking on, and seem as anxious as any boy for the success of the School-house. We get a minute’s breathing-time before old Brooke kicks out, and he gives the word to play strongly for touch, by the three trees. Away goes the ball, and the bull-dogs after it, and in another minute there is shout of “In touch!” “Our ball!” Now’s your time, old Brooke, while your men are still fresh. He stands with the ball in his hand, while the two sides form in deep lines opposite one another; he must strike it straight out between them. The lines are thickest close to him, but young Brooke and two or three of his men are shifting up farther, where the opposite line is weak. Old Brooke strikes it out straight and strong, and it falls opposite his brother. Hurrah! that rush has taken it right through the School line, and away past the three trees, far into their quarters, and young Brooke and the bull-dogs are close upon it. The School leaders rush back, shouting, “Look out in goal!” and strain every nerve to catch him, but they are after the fleetest foot in Rugby. There they go straight for the School goal-posts, quarters scattering before them. One after another the bull-dogs go down, but young Brooke holds on. “He is down.” No! a long stagger, but the danger is past. That was the shock of Crew, the most dangerous of dodgers. And now he is close to the School goal, the ball not three yards before him. There is a hurried rush of the School fags to the spot, but no one throws himself on the ball, the only chance, and young Brooke has touched it right under the School goal-posts.",quarter hour gone first wind fail weight number begin tell yard yard house drive contest inch ground bull dog colour mother earth shoulder ankle young have marvellous knack keep leg house penn turn ball goal wall family look seem anxious boy success house get minute breathing time old kick give word play touch tree go ball bull dog minute be shout touch ball time old man fresh stand ball hand side form deep line strike line thickest close young man shift opposite line weak old strike strong fall brother rush take line tree quarter young bull dog close leader rush shouting look goal strain nerve catch fleetest foot go school goal post quarter scatter bull dog go young hold long stagger danger past shock dangerous dodger close goal ball yard be hurry rush school fag spot throw ball only chance young touch goal post 
63,"The School leaders come up furious, and administer toco to the wretched fags nearest at hand. They may well be angry, for it is all Lombard Street to a china orange that the School-house kick a goal with the ball touched in such a good place. Old Brooke, of course, will kick it out, but who shall catch and place it? Call Crab Jones. Here he comes, sauntering along with a straw in his mouth, the queerest, coolest fish in Rugby. If he were tumbled into the moon this minute, he would just pick himself up without taking his hands out of his pockets or turning a hair. But it is a moment when the boldest charger’s heart beats quick. Old Brooke stands with the ball under his arm motioning the School back; he will not kick out till they are all in goal, behind the posts. They are all edging forwards, inch by inch, to get nearer for the rush at Crab Jones, who stands there in front of old Brooke to catch the ball. If they can reach and destroy him before he catches, the danger is over; and with one and the same rush they will carry it right away to the School-house goal. Fond hope! it is kicked out and caught beautifully. Crab strikes his heel into the ground, to mark the spot where the ball was caught, beyond which the school line may not advance; but there they stand, five deep, ready to rush the moment the ball touches the ground. Take plenty of room. Don’t give the rush a chance of reaching you. Place it true and steady. Trust Crab Jones. He has made a small hole with his heel for the ball to lie on, by which he is resting on one knee, with his eye on old Brooke. “Now!” Crab places the ball at the word, old Brooke kicks, and it rises slowly and truly as the School rush forward.",leader come furious administer toco wretch fag near hand angry china orange house kick goal ball touch good place old course kick catch place call come saunter straw mouth queerest coolest fish tumble moon minute pick take hand pocket turn hair moment bold charge heart beat quick old stand ball arm motion kick goal post edg forward inch inch get nearer rush stand front old catch ball reach destroy catch danger same rush carry house goal fond hope kick catch crab strike heel ground mark spot ball catch school line advance stand deep ready rush moment ball touch ground take plenty room give rush chance reach place true steady trust make small hole heel ball lie rest knee eye old place ball word old kick rise rush 
64,"Then a moment’s pause, while both sides look up at the spinning ball. There it flies, straight between the two posts, some five feet above the cross-bar, an unquestioned goal; and a shout of real, genuine joy rings out from the School-house players-up, and a faint echo of it comes over the close from the goal-keepers under the Doctor’s wall. A goal in the first hour--such a thing hasn’t been done in the School-house match these five years.",moment pause side look spinning ball fly post foot cross- bar unquestioned goal shout real genuine joy ring house player faint echo come close goal keeper wall goal first hour thing do school house match year 
65,"“Over!” is the cry. The two sides change goals, and the School-house goal-keepers come threading their way across through the masses of the School, the most openly triumphant of them--amongst whom is Tom, a School-house boy of two hours’ standing--getting their ears boxed in the transit. Tom indeed is excited beyond measure, and it is all the sixth-form boy, kindest and safest of goal-keepers, has been able to do, to keep him from rushing out whenever the ball has been near their goal. So he holds him by his side, and instructs him in the science of touching.",cry side change goal house goal keeper come thread way mass triumphant house boy hour standing get ear box transit excite measure sixth form boy kindest safe goal keeper able do keep rush ball goal hold side instruct science touch 
66,"At this moment Griffith, the itinerant vender of oranges from Hill Morton, enters the close with his heavy baskets. There is a rush of small boys upon the little pale-faced man, the two sides mingling together, subdued by the great goddess Thirst, like the English and French by the streams in the Pyrenees. The leaders are past oranges and apples, but some of them visit their coats, and apply innocent-looking ginger-beer bottles to their mouths. It is no ginger-beer though, I fear, and will do you no good. One short mad rush, and then a stitch in the side, and no more honest play. That’s what comes of those bottles.",moment itinerant vender orange enter close heavy basket be rush small boy little pale face man side mingle subdued great goddess thirst english stream leader past orange apple visit coat apply innocent look ginger beer bottle mouth ginger beer fear do good short mad rush stitch side honest play come bottle 
67,"But now Griffith’s baskets are empty, the ball is placed again midway, and the School are going to kick off. Their leaders have sent their lumber into goal, and rated the rest soundly, and one hundred and twenty picked players-up are there, bent on retrieving the game. They are to keep the ball in front of the School-house goal, and then to drive it in by sheer strength and weight. They mean heavy play and no mistake, and so old Brooke sees, and places Crab Jones in quarters just before the goal, with four or five picked players who are to keep the ball away to the sides, where a try at goal, if obtained, will be less dangerous than in front. He himself, and Warner and Hedge, who have saved themselves till now, will lead the charges.",basket empty ball place go kick leader send lumber goal rate rest pick player bend retrieve game keep ball front house goal drive sheer strength weight mean heavy play mistake old see place quarter goal pick player keep ball side try goal obtain dangerous front save lead charge 
68,"“Are you ready?” “Yes.” And away comes the ball, kicked high in the air, to give the School time to rush on and catch it as it falls. And here they are amongst us. Meet them like Englishmen, you Schoolhouse boys, and charge them home. Now is the time to show what mettle is in you; and there shall be a warm seat by the hall fire, and honour, and lots of bottled beer to-night for him who does his duty in the next half-hour. And they are well met. Again and again the cloud of their players-up gathers before our goal, and comes threatening on, and Warner or Hedge, with young Brooke and the relics of the bull-dogs, break through and carry the ball back; and old Brooke ranges the field like Job’s war-horse. The thickest scrummage parts asunder before his rush, like the waves before a clipper’s bows; his cheery voice rings out over the field, and his eye is everywhere. And if these miss the ball, and it rolls dangerously in front of our goal, Crab Jones and his men have seized it and sent it away towards the sides with the unerring drop-kick. This is worth living for--the whole sum of school-boy existence gathered up into one straining, struggling half-hour, a half-hour worth a year of common life.",ready come ball kick air give school time rush catch fall meet boy charge time show mettle warm seat hall fire honour lot bottled beer night do duty next half hour meet cloud player gather goal come threaten young relic bull dog break carry ball old range field war horse thickest scrummage part rush wave clipper bow cheery voice ring field eye miss ball roll front goal man seize send side unerr drop kick worth live whole sum school boy existence gather strain struggle half hour half hour worth year common life 
69,"The quarter to five has struck, and the play slackens for a minute before goal; but there is Crew, the artful dodger, driving the ball in behind our goal, on the island side, where our quarters are weakest. Is there no one to meet him? Yes; look at little East! The ball is just at equal distances between the two, and they rush together, the young man of seventeen and the boy of twelve, and kick it at the same moment. Crew passes on without a stagger; East is hurled forward by the shock, and plunges on his shoulder, as if he would bury himself in the ground; but the ball rises straight into the air, and falls behind Crew’s back, while the “bravoes” of the School-house attest the pluckiest charge of all that hard-fought day. Warner picks East up lame and half stunned, and he hobbles back into goal, conscious of having played the man.",quarter strike play slacken minute goal be artful dodger drive ball goal island side quarter weak be meet look little ball equal distance rush young man boy kick same moment crew pass stagger hurl shock plunge shoulder bury ground ball rise air fall bravoe house attest pluckiest charge hard fight day pick lame half stunn hobble goal conscious play man 
70,"And now the last minutes are come, and the School gather for their last rush, every boy of the hundred and twenty who has a run left in him. Reckless of the defence of their own goal, on they come across the level big-side ground, the ball well down amongst them, straight for our goal, like the column of the Old Guard up the slope at Waterloo. All former charges have been child’s play to this. Warner and Hedge have met them, but still on they come. The bull-dogs rush in for the last time; they are hurled over or carried back, striving hand, foot, and eyelids. Old Brooke comes sweeping round the skirts of the play, and turning short round, picks out the very heart of the scrummage, and plunges in. It wavers for a moment; he has the ball. No, it has passed him, and his voice rings out clear over the advancing tide, “Look out in goal!” Crab Jones catches it for a moment; but before he can kick, the rush is upon him and passes over him; and he picks himself up behind them with his straw in his mouth, a little dirtier, but as cool as ever.",last minute come gather last rush boy have run leave reckless defence own goal come level big side ground ball goal column old slope former charge child play meet come bull dog rush last time hurl carry striving hand foot eyelid old come sweep skirt play turn short round pick very heart scrummage plunge waver moment have ball pass voice ring clear advance tide look goal catch moment kick rush pass pick straw mouth little dirty cool

72,"There stands the School-house praepostor, safest of goal-keepers, and Tom Brown by his side, who has learned his trade by this time. Now is your time, Tom. The blood of all the Browns is up, and the two rush in together, and throw themselves on the ball, under the very feet of the advancing column--the praepostor on his hands and knees, arching his back, and Tom all along on his face. Over them topple the leaders of the rush, shooting over the back of the praepostor, but falling flat on Tom, and knocking all the wind out of his small carcass. “Our ball,” says the praepostor, rising with his prize; “but get up there; there’s a little fellow under you.” They are hauled and roll off him, and Tom is discovered, a motionless body.",stand house praepostor safe goal keeper side learn trade time time blood rush throw ball very foot advance column praepostor hand knee arch back face topple leader rush shoot back praepostor fall flat knock wind small carcass ball say praepostor rise prize get be little fellow haul roll discover motionless body
