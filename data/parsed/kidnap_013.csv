2,"Before we had done cleaning out the round-house, a breeze sprang up from a little to the east of north. This blew off the rain and brought out the sun.",do clean round house breeze spring little east north blow rain bring sun 
3,"And here I must explain; and the reader would do well to look at a map. On the day when the fog fell and we ran down Alan’s boat, we had been running through the Little Minch. At dawn after the battle, we lay becalmed to the east of the Isle of Canna or between that and Isle Eriska in the chain of the Long Island. Now to get from there to the Linnhe Loch, the straight course was through the narrows of the Sound of Mull. But the captain had no chart; he was afraid to trust his brig so deep among the islands; and the wind serving well, he preferred to go by west of Tiree and come up under the southern coast of the great Isle of Mull.",explain reader do look map day fog fall run boat run little dawn battle lay becalm east chain long get straight course narrow captain have chart afraid trust brig deep island wind serve prefer go come southern coast great 
4,"All day the breeze held in the same point, and rather freshened than died down; and towards afternoon, a swell began to set in from round the outer Hebrides. Our course, to go round about the inner isles, was to the west of south, so that at first we had this swell upon our beam, and were much rolled about. But after nightfall, when we had turned the end of Tiree and began to head more to the east, the sea came right astern.",day breeze hold same point freshen die afternoon swell begin set outer course go inner isle west south have swell beam roll nightfall turn end begin head east sea come astern 
5,"Meanwhile, the early part of the day, before the swell came up, was very pleasant; sailing, as we were, in a bright sunshine and with many mountainous islands upon different sides. Alan and I sat in the round-house with the doors open on each side (the wind being straight astern), and smoked a pipe or two of the captain’s fine tobacco. It was at this time we heard each other’s stories, which was the more important to me, as I gained some knowledge of that wild Highland country on which I was so soon to land. In those days, so close on the back of the great rebellion, it was needful a man should know what he was doing when he went upon the heather.",early part day swell come pleasant sailing bright sunshine many mountainous island different side sit round house door open side wind straight astern smoke pipe captain fine tobacco time hear other story important gain knowledge wild country land day close back great rebellion needful man know do go heather 
6,"It was I that showed the example, telling him all my misfortune; which he heard with great good-nature. Only, when I came to mention that good friend of mine, Mr. Campbell the minister, Alan fired up and cried out that he hated all that were of that name.",show example tell misfortune hear great good nature come mention good friend minister fire cry hate name 
7,"“Why,” said I, “he is a man you should be proud to give your hand to.”",say man proud give hand

If I lay dying, I would crawl upon my knees to my chamber window for a shot at one.”",know help say leaden bullet hunt name blackcock lay die crawl knee chamber window shot 
9,"“Why, Alan,” I cried, “what ails ye at the Campbells?”",cry ail 
10,"“Well,” says he, “ye ken very well that I am an Appin Stewart, and the Campbells have long harried and wasted those of my name; ay, and got lands of us by treachery--but never with the sword,” he cried loudly, and with the word brought down his fist upon the table. But I paid the less attention to this, for I knew it was usually said by those who have the underhand. “There’s more than that,” he continued, “and all in the same story: lying words, lying papers, tricks fit for a peddler, and the show of what’s legal over all, to make a man the more angry.”",say harry waste name get land treachery sword cry word bring fist table pay less attention know say have underhand be more continue same story lie word lying paper trick fit peddler show legal make man angry 
11,"“You that are so wasteful of your buttons,” said I, “I can hardly think you would be a good judge of business.”",wasteful button say think good judge business 
12,"“Ah!” says he, falling again to smiling, “I got my wastefulness from the same man I got the buttons from; and that was my poor father, Duncan Stewart, grace be to him! He was the prettiest man of his kindred; and the best swordsman in the Hielands, David, and that is the same as to say, in all the world, I should ken, for it was him that taught me. He was in the Black Watch, when first it was mustered; and, like other gentlemen privates, had a gillie at his back to carry his firelock for him on the march. Well, the King, it appears, was wishful to see Hieland swordsmanship; and my father and three more were chosen out and sent to London town, to let him see it at the best. So they were had into the palace and showed the whole art of the sword for two hours at a stretch, before King George and Queen Carline, and the Butcher Cumberland, and many more of whom I havenae mind. And when they were through, the King (for all he was a rank usurper) spoke them fair and gave each man three guineas in his hand. Now, as they were going out of the palace, they had a porter’s lodge to go by; and it came in on my father, as he was perhaps the first private Hieland gentleman that had ever gone by that door, it was right he should give the poor porter a proper notion of their quality. So he gives the King’s three guineas into the man’s hand, as if it was his common custom; the three others that came behind him did the same; and there they were on the street, never a penny the better for their pains. Some say it was one, that was the first to fee the King’s porter; and some say it was another; but the truth of it is, that it was Duncan Stewart, as I am willing to prove with either sword or pistol. And that was the father that I had, God rest him!”",say fall smile get wastefulness same man get button poor father grace prettiest man kindred good swordsman same say world ke teach black muster other gentleman private have gillie back carry firelock march appear wishful see swordsmanship father more choose send town let see good have palace show whole art sword hour stretch many more havenae mind rank usurper speak fair give man guinea hand go palace have porter lodge go come father first private gentleman go door right give poor porter proper notion quality give guinea man hand common custom other come do same street penny good pain say first fee porter say truth willing prove sword pistol father have rest

14,"“And that’s true,” said Alan. “He left me my breeks to cover me, and little besides. And that was how I came to enlist, which was a black spot upon my character at the best of times, and would still be a sore job for me if I fell among the red-coats.”",true say leave breek cover little come enlist black spot character good time sore job fall red coat

17,"I could scarcely share this view: holding desertion under arms for an unpardonable fault in honour. But for all I was so young, I was wiser than say my thought. “Dear, dear,” says I, “the punishment is death.”",share view hold desertion arm unpardonable fault honour young wise say thought dear dear say punishment death

24,"“Well, ye see, I weary for my friends and country,” said he. “France is a braw place, nae doubt; but I weary for the heather and the deer. And then I have bit things that I attend to. Whiles I pick up a few lads to serve the King of France: recruits, ye see; and that’s aye a little money. But the heart of the matter is the business of my chief, Ardshiel.”",see weary friend country say braw place doubt weary heather deer have bit thing attend pick few lad serve recruit see little money heart matter business chief 
25,"“I thought they called your chief Appin,” said I.",think call chief say 
26,"“Ay, but Ardshiel is the captain of the clan,” said he, which scarcely cleared my mind. “Ye see, David, he that was all his life so great a man, and come of the blood and bearing the name of kings, is now brought down to live in a French town like a poor and private person. He that had four hundred swords at his whistle, I have seen, with these eyes of mine, buying butter in the market-place, and taking it home in a kale-leaf. This is not only a pain but a disgrace to us of his family and clan. There are the bairns forby, the children and the hope of Appin, that must be learned their letters and how to hold a sword, in that far country. Now, the tenants of Appin have to pay a rent to King George; but their hearts are staunch, they are true to their chief; and what with love and a bit of pressure, and maybe a threat or two, the poor folk scrape up a second rent for Ardshiel. Well, David, I’m the hand that carries it.” And he struck the belt about his body, so that the guineas rang.",captain clan say clear mind see life great man come blood bear name king bring live french town poor private person have sword whistle see eye buy butter market place take kale leaf pain disgrace family clan be bairn child hope learn letter hold sword far country tenant have pay rent heart staunch true chief love bit pressure threat poor folk scrape second rent hand carry strike belt body guinea ring

30,"“Ay, David,” said he. “I told a different tale to yon captain man; but this is the truth of it. And it’s wonderful to me how little pressure is needed. But that’s the handiwork of my good kinsman and my father’s friend, James of the Glens: James Stewart, that is: Ardshiel’s half-brother. He it is that gets the money in, and does the management.”",say tell different tale captain man truth wonderful little pressure need handiwork good kinsman father friend half brother get money management

33,"“Ay” said he, “ye’re a Whig, but ye’re a gentleman; and that’s what does it. Now, if ye were one of the cursed race of Campbell, ye would gnash your teeth to hear tell of it. If ye were the Red Fox...” And at that name, his teeth shut together, and he ceased speaking. I have seen many a grim face, but never a grimmer than Alan’s when he had named the Red Fox.",say gentleman curse race gnash tooth hear tell red name tooth shut cease speak see many grim face grimmer name red 
34,"“And who is the Red Fox?” I asked, daunted, but still curious.",red ask daunt curious 
35,"“Who is he?” cried Alan. “Well, and I’ll tell you that. When the men of the clans were broken at Culloden, and the good cause went down, and the horses rode over the fetlocks in the best blood of the north, Ardshiel had to flee like a poor deer upon the mountains--he and his lady and his bairns. A sair job we had of it before we got him shipped; and while he still lay in the heather, the English rogues, that couldnae come at his life, were striking at his rights. They stripped him of his powers; they stripped him of his lands; they plucked the weapons from the hands of his clansmen, that had borne arms for thirty centuries; ay, and the very clothes off their backs--so that it’s now a sin to wear a tartan plaid, and a man may be cast into a gaol if he has but a kilt about his legs. One thing they couldnae kill. That was the love the clansmen bore their chief. These guineas are the proof of it. And now, in there steps a man, a Campbell, red-headed Colin of Glenure----”",cry tell man clan break good cause go horse ride fetlock good blood north have flee poor deer mountain lady bairn sair job have get ship lay heather english rogue noe come life strike right stripp power stripp land pluck weapon hand clansmen borne arm century very clothes back sin wear tartan plaid man cast gaol have kilt leg thing noe kill love clansmen bear chief guinea proof step man red head 
36,“Is that him you call the Red Fox?” said I.,call red say 
37,"“Will ye bring me his brush?” cries Alan, fiercely. “Ay, that’s the man. In he steps, and gets papers from King George, to be so-called King’s factor on the lands of Appin. And at first he sings small, and is hail-fellow-well-met with Sheamus--that’s James of the Glens, my chieftain’s agent. But by-and-by, that came to his ears that I have just told you; how the poor commons of Appin, the farmers and the crofters and the boumen, were wringing their very plaids to get a second rent, and send it over-seas for Ardshiel and his poor bairns.

39,"“And you little better than a common Whig!” cries Alan. “But when it came to Colin Roy, the black Campbell blood in him ran wild. He sat gnashing his teeth at the wine table. What! should a Stewart get a bite of bread, and him not be able to prevent it? Ah! Red Fox, if ever I hold you at a gun’s end, the Lord have pity upon ye!” (Alan stopped to swallow down his anger.) “Well, David, what does he do? He declares all the farms to let. And, thinks he, in his black heart, ‘I’ll soon get other tenants that’ll overbid these Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs’ (for these are all names in my clan, David); ‘and then,’ thinks he, ‘Ardshiel will have to hold his bonnet on a French roadside.’”",little good common cry come black blood run wild sit gnash tooth wine table get bite bread able prevent red hold gun end have pity stop swallow anger do declare farm let think black heart get other tenant overbid name clan think have hold bonnet french roadside

42,"“Ay,” said he, “ye’ll never guess that! For these same Stewarts, and Maccolls, and Macrobs (that had two rents to pay, one to King George by stark force, and one to Ardshiel by natural kindness) offered him a better price than any Campbell in all broad Scotland; and far he sent seeking them--as far as to the sides of Clyde and the cross of Edinburgh--seeking, and fleeching, and begging them to come, where there was a Stewart to be starved and a red-headed hound of a Campbell to be pleasured!”",say guess same have rent pay stark force natural kindness offer good price broad send seek side cross seek fleech begg come be starve red head hound pleasure 
43,"“Well, Alan,” said I, “that is a strange story, and a fine one, too. And Whig as I may be, I am glad the man was beaten.”",say strange story fine one glad man beat 
44,"“Him beaten?” echoed Alan. “It’s little ye ken of Campbells, and less of the Red Fox. Him beaten? No: nor will be, till his blood’s on the hillside! But if the day comes, David man, that I can find time and leisure for a bit of hunting, there grows not enough heather in all Scotland to hide him from my vengeance!”",beat echoe little ken less red beat blood hillside day come find time leisure bit hunting grow enough heather hide vengeance 
45,"“Man Alan,” said I, “ye are neither very wise nor very Christian to blow off so many words of anger. They will do the man ye call the Fox no harm, and yourself no good. Tell me your tale plainly out. What did he next?”",say wise christian blow many word anger do man call harm good tell tale next 
46,"“And that’s a good observe, David,” said Alan. “Troth and indeed, they will do him no harm; the more’s the pity! And barring that about Christianity (of which my opinion is quite otherwise, or I would be nae Christian), I am much of your mind.”",good observe say do harm more pity barr opinion much mind

48,"“Ay” said he, “it’s well seen it was a Campbell taught ye! It would be a convenient world for them and their sort, if there was no such a thing as a lad and a gun behind a heather bush! But that’s nothing to the point. This is what he did.”",say see teach convenient world sort be thing lad gun heather bush point do 
49,"“Ay” said I, “come to that.”",say come 
50,"“Well, David,” said he, “since he couldnae be rid of the loyal commons by fair means, he swore he would be rid of them by foul. Ardshiel was to starve: that was the thing he aimed at. And since them that fed him in his exile wouldnae be bought out--right or wrong, he would drive them out. Therefore he sent for lawyers, and papers, and red-coats to stand at his back. And the kindly folk of that country must all pack and tramp, every father’s son out of his father’s house, and out of the place where he was bred and fed, and played when he was a callant. And who are to succeed them? Bare-leggit beggars! King George is to whistle for his rents; he maun dow with less; he can spread his butter thinner: what cares Red Colin? If he can hurt Ardshiel, he has his wish; if he can pluck the meat from my chieftain’s table, and the bit toys out of his children’s hands, he will gang hame singing to Glenure!”",say rid loyal common fair means swore rid foul starve thing aim feed exile buy right wrong drive send lawyer paper red -coat stand back kindly folk country pack tramp father son father house place breed feed play callant succeed bare leggit beggar whistle rent maun dow less spread butter thin care red hurt have wish pluck meat chieftain table bit toy child hand gang hame sing 
51,"“Let me have a word,” said I. “Be sure, if they take less rents, be sure Government has a finger in the pie. It’s not this Campbell’s fault, man--it’s his orders. And if ye killed this Colin to-morrow, what better would ye be? There would be another factor in his shoes, as fast as spur can drive.”",let have word say sure take less rent sure government have finger pie fault man order kill good be factor shoe spur drive

53,"He spoke kindly enough, but there was so much anger under his contempt that I thought it was wise to change the conversation. I expressed my wonder how, with the Highlands covered with troops, and guarded like a city in a siege, a man in his situation could come and go without arrest.",speak be much anger contempt think wise change conversation express wonder cover troops guard city siege man situation come go arrest 
54,"“It’s easier than ye would think,” said Alan. “A bare hillside (ye see) is like all one road; if there’s a sentry at one place, ye just go by another. And then the heather’s a great help. And everywhere there are friends’ houses and friends’ byres and haystacks. And besides, when folk talk of a country covered with troops, it’s but a kind of a byword at the best. A soldier covers nae mair of it than his boot-soles. I have fished a water with a sentry on the other side of the brae, and killed a fine trout; and I have sat in a heather bush within six feet of another, and learned a real bonny tune from his whistling. This was it,” said he, and whistled me the air.",easy think say bare hillside see road be sentry place go heather great help be friend house friend byre haystack folk talk country cover troops kind byword good soldier cover nae mair boot sole fish water sentry other side brae kill fine trout sit heather bush foot learn real bonny tune whistling say whistle air

Small wonder, with never a gun or a sword left from Cantyre to Cape Wrath, but what tenty* folk have hidden in their thatch! But what I would like to ken, David, is just how long? Not long, ye would think, with men like Ardshiel in exile and men like the Red Fox sitting birling the wine and oppressing the poor at home. But it’s a kittle thing to decide what folk’ll bear, and what they will not. Or why would Red Colin be riding his horse all over my poor country of Appin, and never a pretty lad to put a bullet in him?”",continue sae bad call pacify small wonder gun sword leave tenty folk hide thatch like ke think man exile man red sit birl wine oppress poor home kittle thing decide folk bear red ride horse poor country lad put bullet

58,"I will add the rest of what I have to say about my friend, that he was skilled in all kinds of music, but principally pipe-music; was a well-considered poet in his own tongue; had read several books both in French and English; was a dead shot, a good angler, and an excellent fencer with the small sword as well as with his own particular weapon. For his faults, they were on his face, and I now knew them all. But the worst of them, his childish propensity to take offence and to pick quarrels, he greatly laid aside in my case, out of regard for the battle of the round-house. But whether it was because I had done well myself, or because I had been a witness of his own much greater prowess, is more than I can tell. For though he had a great taste for courage in other men, yet he admired it most in Alan Breck.",add rest have say friend skilled kind music pipe music consider poet own tongue read several book french dead shot good angler excellent fencer small sword own particular weapon fault face know bad childish propensity take offence pick quarrel lay case regard battle round house do witness own great prowess more tell have great taste courage other man admire most
