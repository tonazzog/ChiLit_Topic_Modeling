2,"The learned gentleman had let his dinner get quite cold. It was mutton chop, and as it lay on the plate it looked like a brown island in the middle of a frozen pond, because the grease of the gravy had become cold, and consequently white. It looked very nasty, and it was the first thing the children saw when, after knocking three times and receiving no reply, one of them ventured to turn the handle and softly to open the door. The chop was on the end of a long table that ran down one side of the room. The table had images on it and queer-shaped stones, and books. And there were glass cases fixed against the wall behind, with little strange things in them. The cases were rather like the ones you see in jewellers’ shops.",learn gentleman let dinner get cold mutton chop lay plate look brown island middle freeze pond grease gravy become cold white look nasty first thing child see knock time receive reply venture turn handle open door chop end long table run side room table have image queer shape stone book be glass case fix wall little strange thing case one see jeweller shop 
3,"The ‘poor learned gentleman’ was sitting at a table in the window, looking at something very small which he held in a pair of fine pincers. He had a round spy-glass sort of thing in one eye--which reminded the children of watchmakers, and also of the long snail’s eyes of the Psammead. The gentleman was very long and thin, and his long, thin boots stuck out under the other side of his table. He did not hear the door open, and the children stood hesitating. At last Robert gave the door a push, and they all started back, for in the middle of the wall that the door had hidden was a mummy-case--very, very, very big--painted in red and yellow and green and black, and the face of it seemed to look at them quite angrily.",poor learn gentleman’ sit table window look small hold pair fine pincer have round spy glass sort thing eye- remind child watchmaker long snail eye gentleman long thin long thin boot stick other side table hear door open child stand hesitate last give door push start middle wall door hide mummy case big paint red yellow green black face seem look

The first chair had things like bricks that tiny, tiny birds’ feet have walked over when the bricks were soft, only the marks were in regular lines. The second chair had round things on it like very large, fat, long, pale beads. And the last chair had a pile of dusty papers on it. The children sat down.",find be say gentleman clear more chair put thing floor first chair have thing brick tiny tiny bird foot walk brick soft mark regular line second chair have round thing large fat long pale bead last chair have pile dusty paper child sit

His laugh sounded rusty, Cyril thought, as though it wasn’t often used.",say blush know look gentleman take spectacle laugh laugh sound rusty think use 
18,"‘Of course!’ he said. ‘I’m sure I beg your pardon. I think I must have been in a dream. You are the children who live downstairs, are you not? Yes. I have seen you as I have passed in and out.

And the Sammy--I mean, something told us it would work, though it’s only half a one; but it won’t work unless we can say the name that’s on it. But, of course, if you’ve got another name that can lick ours, our charm will be no go; so we want you to give us your word of honour as a gentleman--though I’m sure, now I’ve seen you, that it’s not necessary; but still I’ve promised to ask you, so we must.

26,"Some faint memory of a far-off childhood must have come to the learned gentleman just then, for he smiled. ‘I see,’ he said. ‘It is some sort of game that you are engaged in? Of course! Yes! Well, I will certainly promise. Yet I wonder how you heard of the names of power?’",faint memory childhood come learn gentleman smile see say sort game engage course promise wonder hear name power

29,"‘Excuse me,’ he said in quite a changed voice, and carried the charm to the window. He looked at it; he turned it over. He fixed his spy-glass in his eye and looked again. No one said anything. Only Robert made a shuffling noise with his feet till Anthea nudged him to shut up. At last the learned gentleman drew a long breath.",excuse say change voice carry charm window look turn fix spy glass eye look say make shuffle noise foot nudge shut last learn gentleman draw long breath

58,"Anthea caught the others at the stair-foot. They woke the Psammead, and it taught them exactly how to use the word of power, and to make the charm speak. I am not going to tell you how this is done, because you might try to do it. And for you any such trying would be almost sure to end in disappointment. Because in the first place it is a thousand million to one against your ever getting hold of the right sort of charm, and if you did, there would be hardly any chance at all of your finding a learned gentleman clever enough and kind enough to read the word for you.",catch other stair foot wake teach use word power make charm speak go tell do try do such try sure end disappointment first place get hold right sort charm be chance finding learn gentleman clever kind read word

61,"When all was ready, the Psammead signed to Anthea to say the word. And she said it. Instantly the whole light of all the world seemed to go out. The room was dark. The world outside was dark--darker than the darkest night that ever was. And all the sounds went out too, so that there was a silence deeper than any silence you have ever even dreamed of imagining. It was like being suddenly deaf and blind, only darker and quieter even than that.",ready sign say word say whole light world seem go room dark world dark dark dark night sound go be silence deep silence dream imagin deaf blind dark quiet 
62,"But before the children had got over the sudden shock of it enough to be frightened, a faint, beautiful light began to show in the middle of the circle, and at the same moment a faint, beautiful voice began to speak. The light was too small for one to see anything by, and the voice was too small for you to hear what it said. You could just see the light and just hear the voice.",child get sudden shock frighten faint beautiful light begin show middle circle same moment faint beautiful voice begin speak light small see voice small hear say see light hear voice 
63,"But the light grew stronger. It was greeny, like glow-worms’ lamps, and it grew and grew till it was as though thousands and thousands of glow-worms were signalling to their winged sweethearts from the middle of the circle. And the voice grew, not so much in loudness as in sweetness (though it grew louder, too), till it was so sweet that you wanted to cry with pleasure just at the sound of it. It was like nightingales, and the sea, and the fiddle, and the voice of your mother when you have been a long time away, and she meets you at the door when you get home.",light grow strong greeny glow worm lamp grow grow thousand thousand glow worm signal winged sweetheart middle circle voice grow much loudness sweetness grow louder sweet want cry pleasure sound nightingale sea fiddle voice mother long time meet door get

66,"I cannot tell you what language the voice used. I only know that everyone present understood it perfectly. If you come to think of it, there must be some language that everyone could understand, if we only knew what it was. Nor can I tell you how the charm spoke, nor whether it was the charm that spoke, or some presence in the charm. The children could not have told you either. Indeed, they could not look at the charm while it was speaking, because the light was too bright. They looked instead at the green radiance on the faded Kidderminster carpet at the edge of the circle. They all felt very quiet, and not inclined to ask questions or fidget with their feet. For this was not like the things that had happened in the country when the Psammead had given them their wishes. That had been funny somehow, and this was not. It was something like Arabian Nights magic, and something like being in church.

86,"‘That was thousands of years ago. The Amulet was perfect then, and lay in a shrine, the last of many shrines, and I worked wonders. Then came strange men with strange weapons and destroyed my shrine, and the Amulet they bore away with many captives. But of these, one, my priest, knew the word of power, and spoke it for me, so that the Amulet became invisible, and thus returned to my shrine, but the shrine was broken down, and ere any magic could rebuild it one spoke a word before which my power bowed down and was still. And the Amulet lay there, still perfect, but enslaved. Then one coming with stones to rebuild the shrine, dropped a hewn stone on the Amulet as it lay, and one half was sundered from the other. I had no power to seek for that which was lost. And there being none to speak the word of power, I could not rejoin it. So the Amulet lay in the dust of the desert many thousand years, and at last came a small man, a conqueror with an army, and after him a crowd of men who sought to seem wise, and one of these found half the Amulet and brought it to this land. But none could read the name. So I lay still. And this man dying and his son after him, the Amulet was sold by those who came after to a merchant, and from him you bought it, and it is here, and now, the name of power having been spoken, I also am here.’",thousand year perfect lay shrine last many shrine work wonder come strange man strange weapon destroy shrine bear many captive priest know word power speak become invisible return shrine shrine break magic rebuild speak word power bow lay perfect enslave come stone rebuild shrine drop hewn stone lay half sunder other have power seek lose be speak word power rejoin lay dust desert many year last come small man conqueror army crowd man seek seem wise find bring land read name lay man die son sell come merchant buy name power speak

Because I know I have been told that he took an army to Egypt, and that afterwards a lot of wise people went grubbing in the sand, and fished up all sorts of wonderful things, older than you would think possible.
