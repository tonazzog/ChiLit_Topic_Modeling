1,CHAPTER IX.,
2," Montemar was too near the frontier to be a safe abode for the little Duke, and his uncle, Count Hubert of Senlis, agreed with Bernard the Dane that he would be more secure beyond the limits of his own duchy, which was likely soon to be the scene of war; and, sorely against his will, he was sent in secret, under a strong escort, first to the Castle of Coucy, and afterwards to Senlis.",frontier safe abode little uncle agree secure limit own duchy scene war will send secret strong escort 
3,"His consolation was, that he was not again separated from his friends; Alberic, Sir Eric, and even Fru Astrida, accompanied him, as well as his constant follower, Osmond.  Indeed, the Baron would hardly bear that he should be out of his sight; and he was still so carefully watched, that it was almost like a captivity.  Never, even in the summer days, was he allowed to go beyond the Castle walls; and his guardians would fain have had it supposed that the Castle did not contain any such guest.",consolation separate friend accompany constant follower bear sight watch captivity summer day allow go wall guardian have suppose contain such guest 
4,"Osmond did not give him so much of his company as usual, but was always at work in the armourer's forge--a low, vaulted chamber, opening into the Castle court.  Richard and Alberic were very curious to know what he did there; but he fastened the door with an iron bar, and they were forced to content themselves with listening to the strokes of the hammer, keeping time to the voice that sang out, loud and cheerily, the song of ""Sigurd's sword, and the maiden sleeping within the ring of flame.""  Fru Astrida said Osmond was quite right--no good weapon-smith ever toiled with open doors; and when the boys asked him questions as to his work, he only smiled, and said that they would see what it was when the call to arms should come.",give much company usual work armourer forge low vault chamber open court curious know do fasten door iron bar force content listen stroke hammer keep time voice sing loud song sword maiden sleeping ring flame say right good weapon smith toil open door boy ask question work smile say see call arm come 
5,"They thought it near at hand, for tidings came that Louis had assembled his army, and marched into Normandy to recover the person of the young Duke, and to seize the country.  No summons, however, arrived, but a message came instead, that Rouen had been surrendered into the bands of the King.  Richard shed indignant tears.  ""My father's Castle!  My own city in the hands of the foe!  Bernard is a traitor then!  None shall hinder me from so calling him.  Why did we trust him?""",think hand tiding come assemble army march recover person young seize country summons arrive message come surrender band shed indignant tear father own city hand foe traitor hinder call trust

9,"""Peace, peace, my Lord,"" said the Baron.  ""Bernard has more in that wary head of his than your young wits, or my old ones, can unwind.  What he is doing I may not guess, but I gage my life his heart is right.""",peace peace say have more wary head young wit old one unwind do guess gage life heart right 
10,"Richard was silent, remembering he had been once unjust, but he grieved heartily when he thought of the French in Rollo's tower, and it was further reported that the King was about to share Normandy among his French vassals.  A fresh outcry broke out in the little garrison of Senlis, but Sir Eric still persisted in his trust in his friend Bernard, even when he heard that Centeville was marked out as the prey of the fat French Count who had served for a hostage at Rouen.",silent remember unjust grieve think tower report about share french vassal fresh outcry break little garrison persist trust friend hear mark prey fat french serve hostage 
11,"""What say you now, my Lord?"" said he, after a conference with a messenger at the gate.  ""The Black Raven has spread its wings.  Fifty keels are in the Seine, and Harald Blue-tooth's Long Serpent at the head of them.""",say say conference messenger gate black spread wing keel tooth long head 
12,"""The King of Denmark! Come to my aid!""",come aid

18,"""But the Danes, father, the Danes!"" said Osmond.  ""Blows will be passing now.  I may join the host and win my spurs?""",father say blow pass join host win spur 
19,"""With all my heart,"" returned the Baron, ""so my Lord here gives you leave: would that I could leave him and go with you.  It would do my very spirit good but to set foot in a Northern keel once more.""",heart return give leave leave go do very spirit good set foot northern keel more

22,"""Son, son, what talk is this for the child's ears?"" broke in Fru Astrida, ""are these words for a Christian Baron?""",son son talk child ear break word christian 
23,"""Your pardon, mother,"" said the grey warrior, in all humility, ""but my blood thrills to hear of a Northern fleet at hand, and to think of Osmond drawing sword under a Sea-King.""",pardon mother say grey warrior humility blood thrill hear northern fleet hand think draw sword 
24,"The next morning, Osmond's steed was led to the door, and such men-at-arms as could be spared from the garrison of Senlis were drawn up in readiness to accompany him.  The boys stood on the steps, wishing they were old enough to be warriors, and wondering what had become of him, until at length the sound of an opening door startled them, and there, in the low archway of the smithy, the red furnace glowing behind him, stood Osmond, clad in bright steel, the links of his hauberk reflecting the light, and on his helmet a pair of golden wings, while the same device adorned his long pointed kite-shaped shield.",next morning steed lead door such man arm spare garrison draw readiness accompany boy stand step wish old warrior wonder become length sound open door startle low archway smithy red furnace glow stand clad bright steel link hauberk reflect light helmet pair golden wing same device adorn long point kite shape shield

26,"""May they fly after the foe, not before him,"" said Sir Eric.  ""Speed thee well, my son--let not our Danish cousins say we learn Frank graces instead of Northern blows.""",fly foe say speed let danish cousin say learn grace northern blow 
27,"With such farewells, Osmond quitted Senlis, while the two boys hastened to the battlements to watch him as long as he remained in view.",such farewell quit boy hasten battlement watch remain view 
28,"The highest tower became their principal resort, and their eyes were constantly on the heath where he had disappeared; but days passed, and they grew weary of the watch, and betook themselves to games in the Castle court.",high tower become principal resort eye heath disappear day pass grow weary watch betak game court 
29,"One day, Alberic, in the character of a Dragon, was lying on his back, panting hard so as to be supposed to cast out volumes of flame and smoke at Richard, the Knight, who with a stick for a lance, and a wooden sword, was waging fierce war; when suddenly the Dragon paused, sat up, and pointed towards the warder on the tower.  His horn was at his lips, and in another moment, the blast rang out through the Castle.",day character lie back pant suppose cast volume flame smoke stick lance wooden sword wage fierce war pause sit point warder tower horn lip moment blast ring 
30,"With a loud shout, both boys rushed headlong up the turret stairs, and came to the top so breathless, that they could not even ask the warder what he saw.  He pointed, and the keen-eyed Alberic exclaimed, ""I see! Look, my Lord, a speck there on the heath!""",loud shout boy rush turret stair come top breathless ask warder see point keen eyed exclaim see look speck heath

34,"""If only it be not flight in earnest,"" said Alberic, a little anxiously, looking into the warder's face, for he was a borderer, and tales of terror of the inroad of the Vicomte du Contentin were rife on the marches of the Epte.",flight earnest say little look warder face borderer tale terror inroad rife march

42,"The drawbridge was lowered, the portcullis raised, and as all the dwellers in the Castle stood gathered in the court, in rode the warrior with the winged helm, bearing in his hand a drooping banner; lowering it as he entered, it unfolded, and displayed, trailing on the ground at the feet of the little Duke of Normandy, the golden lilies of France.",drawbridge lower portcullis raise dweller stand gather court ride warrior winged helm bear hand drooping banner lower enter unfold display trail ground foot little golden lilie

48,"""On the bank of the Dive,"" said Osmond.  ""Ah, father, you might well call old Harcourt wary--his name might better have been Fox-heart than Bear-heart!

He sought but to avoid bloodshed.""",tell tale joy say view bring let see have friend maintain right seek avoid bloodshed 
51,"""And how chanced it?""",chance 
52,"""The Danes were encamped on the Dive, and so soon as the French came in sight, Blue-tooth sent a messenger to Louis, to summon him to quit Neustria, and leave it to you, its lawful owner.  Thereupon, Louis, hoping to win him over with wily words, invited him to hold a personal conference.""",encamp come sight tooth send messenger summon quit leave lawful owner hope win wily word invite hold personal conference 
53,"""Where were you, Osmond?""",
54,"""Where I had scarce patience to be.  Bernard had gathered all of us honest Normans together, and arranged us beneath that standard of the King, as if to repel his Danish inroad.  Oh, he was, in all seeming, hand-and-glove with Louis, guiding him by his counsel, and, verily, seeming his friend and best adviser!  But in one thing he could not prevail.  That ungrateful recreant, Herluin of Montreuil, came with the King, hoping, it seems, to get his share of our spoils; and when Bernard advised the King to send him home, since no true Norman could bear the sight of him, the hot-headed Franks vowed no Norman should hinder them from bringing whom they chose.  So a tent was set up by the riverside, wherein the two Kings, with Bernard, Alan of Brittany, and Count Hugh, held their meeting.  We all stood without, and the two hosts began to mingle together, we Normans making acquaintance with the Danes.  There was a red-haired, wild-looking fellow, who told me he had been with Anlaff in England, and spoke much of the doings of Hako in Norway; when, suddenly, he pointed to a Knight who was near, speaking to a Cotentinois, and asked me his name.  My blood boiled as I answered, for it was Montreuil himself!  'The cause of your Duke's death!' said the Dane. 'Ha, ye Normans are fallen sons of Odin, to see him yet live!'""",have scarce patience gather honest arrange standard repel danish inroad seem hand glove guide counsel seem friend good adviser thing prevail ungrateful recreant come hope seem get share spoil advise send true bear sight hot head vow hinder bring choose tent set hold meeting stand host begin mingle make acquaintance be red haired wild look fellow tell speak much doing point speak ask name blood boil answer cause death say fall son see live 
55,"""You said, I trust, my son, that we follow not the laws of Odin?"" said Fru Astrida.",say trust son follow law say 
56,"""I had no space for a word, grandmother; the Danes took the vengeance on themselves.  In one moment they rushed on Herluin with their axes, and the unhappy man was dead.  All was tumult; every one struck without knowing at whom, or for what.  Some shouted, '_Thor Hulfe_!' some '_Dieu aide_!' others '_Montjoie St. Denis_!'  Northern blood against French, that was all our guide.  I found myself at the foot of this standard, and had a hard combat for it; but I bore it away at last.""",have space word grandmother take vengeance moment rush axe unhappy man dead tumult one strike know shout other northern blood guide find foot standard have hard combat bear last 
57,"""And the Kings?""",
58,"""They hurried out of the tent, it seems, to rejoin their men.  Louis mounted, but you know of old, my Lord, he is but an indifferent horseman, and the beast carried him into the midst of the Danes, where King Harald caught his bridle, and delivered him to four Knights to keep.  Whether he dealt secretly with them, or whether they, as they declared, lost sight of him whilst plundering his tent, I cannot say; but when Harald demanded him of them, he was gone.""",hurry tent seem rejoin man mount know old indifferent horseman beast carry midst catch bridle deliver keep deal declare lose sight plunder tent say demand gone

However, Bernard made close inquiries, found the fellow had been seen in speech with a French horseman, pounced on his wife and children, and threatened they should die if he did not disclose the secret.  So the King was forced to come out of his hiding-place, and is now fast guarded in Rollo's tower--a Dane, with a battle-axe on his shoulder, keeping guard at every turn of the stairs.""",hear ride league meet baser sort bribe hide make close inquiry find fellow see speech french horseman pounce wife child threaten die disclose secret force come hiding place guard tower battle axe shoulder keep guard turn stair
