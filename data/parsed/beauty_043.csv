2," The election day came at last; there was no lack of work for Jerry and me. First came a stout puffy gentleman with a carpet bag; he wanted to go to the Bishopsgate station; then we were called by a party who wished to be taken to the Regent’s Park; and next we were wanted in a side street where a timid, anxious old lady was waiting to be taken to the bank; there we had to stop to take her back again, and just as we had set her down a red-faced gentleman, with a handful of papers, came running up out of breath, and before Jerry could get down he had opened the door, popped himself in, and called out, “Bow Street Police Station, quick!” so off we went with him, and when after another turn or two we came back, there was no other cab on the stand. Jerry put on my nose-bag, for as he said, “We must eat when we can on such days as these; so munch away, Jack, and make the best of your time, old boy.”",election day come last be lack work come stout puffy gentleman carpet bag want go station call party wish take want side street timid anxious old lady wait take bank have stop take set red face gentleman handful paper come run breath get open door pop call quick go turn come be other cab stand put nose bag say eat such day munch make good time old boy 
3,"I found I had a good feed of crushed oats wetted up with a little bran; this would be a treat any day, but very refreshing then. Jerry was so thoughtful and kind--what horse would not do his best for such a master? Then he took out one of Polly’s meat pies, and standing near me, he began to eat it. The streets were very full, and the cabs, with the candidates’ colors on them, were dashing about through the crowd as if life and limb were of no consequence; we saw two people knocked down that day, and one was a woman. The horses were having a bad time of it, poor things! but the voters inside thought nothing of that; many of them were half-drunk, hurrahing out of the cab windows if their own party came by. It was the first election I had seen, and I don’t want to be in another, though I have heard things are better now.",find have good feed crush oat wett little bran treat day refresh thoughtful kind horse do good master take meat pie stand begin eat street full cab candidate color dash crowd life limb consequence see person knock day woman horse have bad time poor thing voter think many half drunk hurrah cab window own party come first election see want hear thing good 
4,"Jerry and I had not eaten many mouthfuls before a poor young woman, carrying a heavy child, came along the street. She was looking this way and that way, and seemed quite bewildered. Presently she made her way up to Jerry and asked if he could tell her the way to St. Thomas’ Hospital, and how far it was to get there. She had come from the country that morning, she said, in a market cart; she did not know about the election, and was quite a stranger in London. She had got an order for the hospital for her little boy. The child was crying with a feeble, pining cry.",eat many mouthful poor young woman carry heavy child come street look way way seem bewilder make way ask tell way get come country morning say market cart know election stranger get order hospital little boy child cry feeble pine cry 
5,"“Poor little fellow!” she said, “he suffers a deal of pain; he is four years old and can’t walk any more than a baby; but the doctor said if I could get him into the hospital he might get well; pray, sir, how far is it; and which way is it?”",poor little fellow say suffer deal pain year old walk more baby doctor say get hospital get pray sir way 
6,"“Why, missis,” said Jerry, “you can’t get there walking through crowds like this! why, it is three miles away, and that child is heavy.”",say get walk crowd mile child heavy 
7,"“Yes, bless him, he is; but I am strong, thank God, and if I knew the way I think I should get on somehow; please tell me the way.”",bless strong thank know way think get tell way 
8,"“You can’t do it,” said Jerry, “you might be knocked down and the child be run over. Now look here, just get into this cab, and I’ll drive you safe to the hospital. Don’t you see the rain is coming on?”",do say knock child run look get cab drive safe hospital see rain come 
9,"“No, sir, no; I can’t do that, thank you, I have only just money enough to get back with. Please tell me the way.”",sir do thank have money get tell way 
10,"“Look you here, missis,” said Jerry, “I’ve got a wife and dear children at home, and I know a father’s feelings; now get you into that cab, and I’ll take you there for nothing. I’d be ashamed of myself to let a woman and a sick child run a risk like that.”",look say get wife dear child home know father feeling get cab take ashamed let woman sick child run risk 
11,"“Heaven bless you!” said the woman, and burst into tears.",heaven bless say woman burst tear 
12,"“There, there, cheer up, my dear, I’ll soon take you there; come, let me put you inside.”",cheer dear take come let put 
13,"As Jerry went to open the door two men, with colors in their hats and buttonholes, ran up calling out, “Cab!”",go open door man color hat buttonhole run call cab 
14,"“Engaged,” cried Jerry; but one of the men, pushing past the woman, sprang into the cab, followed by the other. Jerry looked as stern as a policeman. “This cab is already engaged, gentlemen, by that lady.”",engage cry man push woman spring cab follow other look stern policeman cab engage gentleman lady 
15,"“Lady!” said one of them; “oh! she can wait; our business is very important, besides we were in first, it is our right, and we shall stay in.”",lady say wait business important first right stay 
16,"A droll smile came over Jerry’s face as he shut the door upon them. “All right, gentlemen, pray stay in as long as it suits you; I can wait while you rest yourselves.” And turning his back upon them he walked up to the young woman, who was standing near me. “They’ll soon be gone,” he said, laughing; “don’t trouble yourself, my dear.”",droll smile come face shut door right gentleman pray stay suit wait rest turn back walk young woman stand gone say laugh trouble dear 
17,"And they soon were gone, for when they understood Jerry’s dodge they got out, calling him all sorts of bad names and blustering about his number and getting a summons. After this little stoppage we were soon on our way to the hospital, going as much as possible through by-streets. Jerry rung the great bell and helped the young woman out.",gone understand dodge get call sort bad name bluster number get summons little stoppage way hospital go possible street rung great bell help young woman 
18,"“Thank you a thousand times,” she said; “I could never have got here alone.”",thank time say get 
19,"“You’re kindly welcome, and I hope the dear child will soon be better.”",welcome hope dear child good 
20,"He watched her go in at the door, and gently he said to himself, “Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these.” Then he patted my neck, which was always his way when anything pleased him.",watch go door say do least patt neck way pleased 
21,"The rain was now coming down fast, and just as we were leaving the hospital the door opened again, and the porter called out, “Cab!” We stopped, and a lady came down the steps. Jerry seemed to know her at once; she put back her veil and said, “Barker! Jeremiah Barker, is it you? I am very glad to find you here; you are just the friend I want, for it is very difficult to get a cab in this part of London to-day.”",rain come leave hospital door open porter call cab stop lady come step seem know put veil say glad find friend want difficult get cab part day 
22,"“I shall be proud to serve you, ma’am; I am right glad I happened to be here. Where may I take you to, ma’am?”",proud serve glad happen take 
23,"“To the Paddington Station, and then if we are in good time, as I think we shall be, you shall tell me all about Mary and the children.”",good time think tell child 
24,"We got to the station in good time, and being under shelter the lady stood a good while talking to Jerry. I found she had been Polly’s mistress, and after many inquiries about her she said:",get station good time shelter lady stand good talk find mistress many inquiry say 
25,“How do you find the cab work suit you in winter? I know Mary was rather anxious about you last year.”,find cab work suit winter know anxious last year 
26,"“Yes, ma’am, she was; I had a bad cough that followed me up quite into the warm weather, and when I am kept out late she does worry herself a good deal. You see, ma’am, it is all hours and all weathers, and that does try a man’s constitution; but I am getting on pretty well, and I should feel quite lost if I had not horses to look after. I was brought up to it, and I am afraid I should not do so well at anything else.”",have bad cough follow warm weather keep worry good deal see hour weather try man constitution get feel lose have horse look bring afraid do else 
27,"“Well, Barker,” she said, “it would be a great pity that you should seriously risk your health in this work, not only for your own but for Mary’s and the children’s sake; there are many places where good drivers or good grooms are wanted, and if ever you think you ought to give up this cab work let me know.”",say great pity risk health work own child sake be many place good driver good groom want think give cab work let know 
28,"Then sending some kind messages to Mary she put something into his hand, saying, “There is five shillings each for the two children; Mary will know how to spend it.”",send kind message put hand say be shilling child know spend 
29,"Jerry thanked her and seemed much pleased, and turning out of the station we at last reached home, and I, at least, was tired.",thank seem pleased turn station reach least tired
