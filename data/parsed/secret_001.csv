1,CHAPTER I. THERE IS NO ONE LEFT,chapter i. left 
2," When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen. It was true, too.  She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression.  Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.  Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people.  She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.  So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also.  She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.  The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one.  So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.",send live uncle say disagreeable look child see true have little thin face little thin body thin light hair sour expression hair yellow face yellow bear ill way father hold position english busy ill mother great beauty care go party amuse gay person want little girl bear hand care make understand wish please keep child sight possible sickly fretful ugly little baby keep way become sickly fretful toddle thing keep way remember see dark face other native servant obey give own way angry disturb cry time year old tyrannical selfish little pig live young english governess come teach read write dislike much give place month other governess come try fill go short time first one choose want know read book learn letter 
3,"One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.",hot morning year old awaken feel cross become crosser see servant stand bedside 
4,"""Why did you come?"" she said to the strange woman.  ""I will not let you stay.  Send my Ayah to me.""",come say strange woman let stay send 
5,"The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.",woman look frighten stammer come throw passion beat kick look frighten repeat possible come 
6,"There was something mysterious in the air that morning.  Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces.  But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come.  She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda.  She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.",be mysterious air morning do regular order several native servant seem missing see slunk hurry ashy scared face tell come leave alone morning go last wander garden begin play tree veranda pretend make flower bed stick big scarlet hibiscus blossom little heap earth time grow angry mutter thing say name call return 
7,"""Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!"" she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all.",pig pig daughter pig say call native pig bad insult 
8,"She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one.  She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy.  She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England.  The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.  She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib--Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else--was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes.  Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes.  All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were ""full of lace."" They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.",grind tooth say hear mother come veranda one fair young man stand talk low strange voice know fair young man look boy hear young officer come child stare stare most mother do have chance see use call oftener else tall slim pretty person wear such lovely clothes hair curly silk have delicate little nose seem disdain thing have large laugh eye clothes thin float say full lace look fuller lace morning eye laugh large scared lift fair boy officer face 
9,"""Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?"" Mary heard her say.",bad hear say 
10,"""Awfully,"" the young man answered in a trembling voice.  ""Awfully, Mrs. Lennox.  You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.""",young man answer tremble voice go hill week

12,"""Oh, I know I ought!"" she cried.  ""I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party.  What a fool I was!""",know cry stay go silly dinner party fool 
13,"At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot.  The wailing grew wilder and wilder. ""What is it? What is it?"" Mrs. Lennox gasped.",very moment loud sound wail break servant quarter clutch young man arm stand shiver head foot wail grow wild wild gasp 
14,"""Some one has died,"" answered the boy officer.  ""You did not say it had broken out among your servants.""",one die answer boy officer say break servant 
15,"""I did not know!"" the Mem Sahib cried.  ""Come with me!  Come with me!"" and she turned and ran into the house.",know cry come come turn run house 
16,"After that, appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary.  The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies.  The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts.  Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror.  There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.",appalling thing happen mysteriousness morning explain cholera break fatal form person die fly take ill night die servant wail hut next day other servant dead other run terror be panic side die person bungalow 
17,"During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone.  Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing.  Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours.  She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds.  Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason.  The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was.  Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet.  The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.",confusion bewilderment second day hide nursery forget think want strange thing happen know cry sleep hour know person ill hear mysterious frightening sound creep dining room find empty finish meal table chair plate look push diner rise reason child eat fruit biscuit thirsty drink glass wine stand fill sweet know strong make drowsy go nursery shut frighten cry hear hut hurry sound foot wine make sleepy keep eye open lay bed know more long time 
18,"Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow.",many thing happen hour sleep disturb wail sound thing carry bungalow 
19,"When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall.  The house was perfectly still.  She had never known it to be so silent before.  She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over.  She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead.  There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories.  Mary had been rather tired of the old ones.  She did not cry because her nurse had died.  She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one.  The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.  Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of.  When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves.  But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her.",awaken lay stare wall house know silent hear voice footstep wonder get cholera trouble wonder take care dead be new know new story tired old one cry nurse die affectionate child care much one noise hurry wail cholera frighten angry seem remember alive panic stricken think little girl fond person have cholera seem remember get remember come look 
20,"But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent.  She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels.  She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room.  He slipped under the door as she watched him.",come lay wait house seem grow silent hear rustle matting look see little snake glide watch eye jewel frighten harmless little thing hurt seem hurry get room slip door watch 
21,"""How queer and quiet it is,"" she said.  ""It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.""",queer quiet say sound be bungalow snake 
22,"Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda.  They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices.  No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.  ""What desolation!"" she heard one voice say.  ""That pretty, pretty woman!  I suppose the child, too.  I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.""",next minute hear footstep compound veranda man footstep man enter bungalow talk low voice go meet speak seem open door look room desolation hear voice say pretty woman suppose child hear be child see 
23,"Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later.  She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.  The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father.  He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.",stand middle nursery open door few minute look ugly cross little thing frown begin hungry feel neglect first man come large officer see talk father look tired troubled see startle jump 
24,"""Barney!"" he cried out.  ""There is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!""",cry be child child alone place 
25,"""I am Mary Lennox,"" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly. She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow ""A place like this!"" ""I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up.  Why does nobody come?""",little girl say draw think man rude call father bungalow place fall asleep have cholera waken come 
26,"""It is the child no one ever saw!"" exclaimed the man, turning to his companions.  ""She has actually been forgotten!""",child see exclaim man turn companion forget 
27,"""Why was I forgotten?"" Mary said, stamping her foot.  ""Why does nobody come?""",forget say stamp foot come 
28,The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly.  Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.,young man name look think see wink eye wink tear 
29,"""Poor little kid!"" he said.  ""There is nobody left to come.""",poor little kid say be leave come 
30,"It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib.  That was why the place was so quiet.  It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake.",strange sudden way find have father mother leave die carry night few native servant die leave house get remember be place quiet true be bungalow little rustle snake
