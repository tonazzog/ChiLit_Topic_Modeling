1,CHAPTER 10. WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT,chapter talked 
2,"Edward was standing ginger-beer like a gentleman, happening, as the one that had last passed under the dentist’s hands, to be the capitalist of the flying hour. As in all well-regulated families, the usual tariff obtained in ours,--half-a-crown a tooth; one shilling only if the molar were a loose one. This one, unfortunately--in spite of Edward’s interested affectation of agony--had been shaky undisguised; but the event was good enough to run to ginger-beer. As financier, however, Edward had claimed exemption from any servile duties of procurement, and had swaggered about the garden while I fetched from the village post-office, and Harold stole a tumbler from the pantry. Our preparations complete, we were sprawling on the lawn; the staidest and most self respecting of the rabbits had been let loose to grace the feast, and was lopping demurely about the grass, selecting the juiciest plantains; while Selina, as the eldest lady present, was toying, in her affected feminine way, with the first full tumbler, daintily fishing for bits of broken cork.",stand ginger beer gentleman happen one pass dentist hand capitalist fly hour regulate family usual tariff obtain half crown tooth shilling molar loose one one spite interested affectation agony shaky undisguised event good run ginger beer financier claim exemption servile duty procurement swagger garden fetched village post office steal tumbler pantry preparation complete sprawl lawn staidest self respect rabbit let loose grace feast lopp grass select juiciest plantain old lady present toy affect feminine way first full tumbler fishing bit break cork 
3,"“Hurry up, can’t you?” growled our host; “what are you girls always so beastly particular for?”",hurry growl host girl particular 
4,"“Martha says,” explained Harold (thirsty too, but still just), “that if you swallow a bit of cork, it swells, and it swells, and it swells inside you, till you--”",say explain thirsty swallow bit cork swell swell swell 
5,"“O bosh!” said Edward, draining the glass with a fine pretence of indifference to consequences, but all the same (as I noticed) dodging the floating cork-fragments with skill and judgment.",say drain glass fine pretence indifference consequence same notice dodg float cork fragment skill judgment 
6,"“O, it’s all very well to say bosh,” replied Harold, nettled; “but every one knows it’s true but you. Why, when Uncle Thomas was here last, and they got up a bottle of wine for him, he took just one tiny sip out of his glass, and then he said, ‘Poo, my goodness, that’s corked!’ And he wouldn’t touch it. And they had to get a fresh bottle up. The funny part was, though, I looked in his glass afterwards, when it was brought out into the passage, and there wasn’t any cork in it at all! So I drank it all off, and it was very good!”",say reply nettle one know true last get bottle wine take tiny sip glass say goodness cork touch have get fresh bottle funny part look glass bring passage be cork drink good 
7,"“You’d better be careful, young man!” said his elder brother, regarding him severely. “D’ you remember that night when the Mummers were here, and they had mulled port, and you went round and emptied all the glasses after they had gone away?”",careful young man say elder brother regard remember night mull port go empty glasses go 
8,"“Ow! I did feel funny that night,” chuckled Harold. “Thought the house was comin’ down, it jumped about so; and Martha had to carry me up to bed, ‘cos the stairs was goin’ all waggity!”",feel funny night chuckle think house comin jump have carry bed stair go waggity 
9,We gazed searchingly at our graceless junior; but it was clear that he viewed the matter in the light of a phenomenon rather than of a delinquency.,gaze graceless junior clear view matter light phenomenon delinquency 
10,"A third bottle was by this time circling; and Selina, who had evidently waited for it to reach her, took a most unfairly long pull, and then jumping up and shaking out her frock, announced that she was going for a walk. Then she fled like a hare; for it was the custom of our Family to meet with physical coercion any independence of action in individuals.",third bottle time circle wait reach take long pull jump shake frock announce go walk flead hare custom family meet physical coercion independence action individual 
11,"“She’s off with those Vicarage girls again,” said Edward, regarding Selina’s long black legs twinkling down the path. “She goes out with them every day now; and as soon as ever they start, all their heads go together and they chatter, chatter, chatter the whole blessed time! I can’t make out what they find to talk about. They never stop; it’s gabble, gabble, gabble right along, like a nest of young rooks!”",girl say regard long black leg twinkle path go day start head go chatter chatter chatter whole bless time make find talk stop gabble gabble gabble nest young rook 
12,"“P’raps they talk about birds’-eggs,” I suggested sleepily (the sun was hot, the turf soft, the ginger-beer potent); “and about ships, and buffaloes, and desert islands; and why rabbits have white tails; and whether they’d sooner have a schooner or a cutter; and what they’ll be when they’re men--at least, I mean there’s lots of things to talk about, if you WANT to talk.”",p’rap talk birds’- egg suggest sun hot turf soft ginger beer potent ship buffaloe desert island rabbit have white tail have schooner cutter man least mean be lot thing talk want talk 
13,"“Yes; but they don’t talk about those sort of things at all,” persisted Edward. “How CAN they? They don’t KNOW anything; they can’t DO anything--except play the piano, and nobody would want to talk about THAT; and they don’t care about anything--anything sensible, I mean. So what DO they talk about?”",talk sort thing persist know do play piano want talk care sensible mean talk 
14,"“I asked Martha once,” put in Harold; “and she said, ‘Never YOU mind; young ladies has lots of things to talk about that young gentlemen can’t understand.’”",ask put say mind young lady have lot thing talk young gentleman understand 
15,"“I don’t believe it,” Edward growled.",believe growl 
16,"“Well, that’s what she SAID, anyway,” rejoined Harold, indifferently. The subject did not seem to him of first-class importance, and it was hindering the circulation of the ginger-beer.",say rejoin subject seem first class importance hinder circulation ginger beer 
17,"We heard the click of the front-gate. Through a gap in the hedge we could see the party setting off down the road. Selina was in the middle: a Vicarage girl had her by either arm; their heads were together, as Edward had described; and the clack of their tongues came down the breeze like the busy pipe of starlings on a bright March morning.",hear click front gate gap hedge see party set road middle girl have arm head describe clack tongue come breeze busy pipe starling bright morning 
18,"“What DO they talk about, Charlotte?” I inquired, wishing to pacify Edward. “You go out with them sometimes.”",talk inquire wish pacify go 
19,"“I don’t know,” said poor Charlotte, dolefully. “They make me walk behind, ‘cos they say I’m too little, and mustn’t hear. And I DO want to so,” she added.",know say poor make walk say little hear want add 
20,"“When any lady comes to see Aunt Eliza,” said Harold, “they both talk at once all the time. And yet each of ‘em seems to hear what the other one’s saying. I can’t make out how they do it. Grown-up people are so clever!”",lady come see say talk time seem hear other one say make do grow person clever 
21,"“The Curate’s the funniest man,” I remarked. “He’s always saying things that have no sense in them at all, and then laughing at them as if they were jokes. Yesterday, when they asked him if he’d have some more tea he said ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more,’ and then sniggered all over. I didn’t see anything funny in that. And then somebody asked him about his button-hole and he said ‘’Tis but a little faded flower,’ and exploded again. I thought it very stupid.”",funny man remark say thing have sense laugh joke yesterday ask have more tea say breach dear friend more snigger see funny ask button hole say little fade flower explode think stupid 
22,"“O HIM,” said Edward contemptuously: “he can’t help it, you know; it’s a sort of way he’s got. But it’s these girls I can’t make out. If they’ve anything really sensible to talk about, how is it nobody knows what it is? And if they haven’t--and we know they CAN’T have, naturally--why don’t they shut up their jaw? This old rabbit here--HE doesn’t want to talk. He’s got something better to do.” And Edward aimed a ginger-beer cork at the unruffled beast, who never budged.",o say help know sort way get girl make sensible talk know know have shut jaw old rabbit want talk get good do aim ginger beer cork unruffled beast budge 
23,"“O but rabbits DO talk,” interposed Harold. “I’ve watched them often in their hutch. They put their heads together and their noses go up and down, just like Selina’s and the Vicarage girls’. Only of course I can t hear what they’re saying.”",rabbit talk interpose watch hutch put head nose go girl course hear say 
24,"“Well, if they do,” said Edward, unwillingly, “I’ll bet they don’t talk such rot as those girls do!”--which was ungenerous, as well as unfair; for it had not yet transpired--nor has it to this day--WHAT Selina and her friends talked about.",say bet talk such rot girl do ungenerous unfair transpire have day friend talk
