22,"Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you think you’re changed, do you?’",think wait have else do tell worth hearing minute puff speak last unfold arm take hookah mouth say think change

44,‘Are you content now?’ said the Caterpillar.,content say 
45,"‘Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn’t mind,’ said Alice: ‘three inches is such a wretched height to be.’",like little large sir mind say inch wretch height 
46,"‘It is a very good height indeed!’ said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).",good height say rear speak inch high

48,"‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.",use time say put hookah mouth begin smoke 
49,"This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, ‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.’",time wait choose speak minute take hookah mouth yawn shake get mushroom crawl grass remark go side make grow tall other side make grow short 
50,‘One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?’ thought Alice to herself.,side other side think 
51,"‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",mushroom say ask moment sight 
52,"Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.",remain look mushroom minute try make side find difficult question last stretch arm go break bit edge hand 
53,"‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!",say nibble little right hand bit try effect next moment feel violent blow chin strike foot 
54,"She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.",good deal frighten sudden change feel be time lose shrink set work eat other bit chin press foot be room open mouth do last manage swallow morsel lefthand bit

58,"‘Come, my head’s free at last!’ said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.",come head free last say tone delight change alarm moment find shoulder find see look immense length neck seem rise stalk sea green leave lay 
59,"‘What CAN all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. ‘And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’ She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.",green stuff say shoulder get poor hand see move speak result seem follow little shaking distant green leave 
60,"As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.",seem be chance get hand head try get head delighted find neck bend direction serpent succeed curving graceful zigzag go dive leave find top tree wonder sharp hiss make draw hurry large pigeon fly face beat wing 
61,‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.,serpent scream 
62,‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’,serpent say let 
63,"‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!’",say repeat subdued tone add kind sob try way seem suit 
64,"‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ said Alice.",least idea talk say 
65,"‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried hedges,’ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; ‘but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!’",try root tree try bank try hedge go attend serpent be pleasing 
66,"Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.",puzzled think be use say more finish 
67,"‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!’",trouble hatch egg say look serpent night day have wink sleep week 
68,"‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.",sorry annoy say begin see meaning 
69,"‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’",take high tree wood continue raise voice shriek think free last need come wriggle sky 
70,"‘But I’m NOT a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m a--I’m a--’",serpent tell say 
71,‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re trying to invent something!’,say see try invent 
72,"‘I--I’m a little girl,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.",little girl say remember number change go day 
73,"‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!’",likely story say tone deep contempt see good many little girl time neck serpent be use deny suppose tell taste egg 
74,"‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, who was a very truthful child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.’",taste egg say truthful child little girl eat egg serpent do know 
75,"‘I don’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’",believe say kind serpent say 
76,"This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?’",new idea silent minute give opportunity add look egg know matter little girl serpent 
77,"‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said Alice hastily; ‘but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t like them raw.’",matter good deal say look egg happen want like raw 
78,"‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.",say sulky tone settle nest crouch tree neck keep entangle branch have stop untwist while remember hold piece mushroom hand set work nibble other grow tall short succeed bring usual height 
79,"It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",long right size feel strange first use few minute begin talk usual come be plan do puzzling change sure go minute get right size next thing get beautiful garden do wonder say come open place little house foot high live think do come size frighten wit begin nibble righthand bit venture go house bring inch high
