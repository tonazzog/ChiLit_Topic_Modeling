1,CHAPTER 7. A DAY AT SCHOOL.,chapter day school 
2,"If Hester Thornton went to sleep that night under a sort of dreamy, hazy impression that school was a place without a great deal of order, with many kind and sympathising faces, and with some not so agreeable; if she went to sleep under the impression that she had dropped into a sort of medley, that she had found herself in a vast new world where certain personages exercised undoubtedly a strong moral influence, but where on the whole a number of other people did pretty much what they pleased-- she awoke in the morning to find her preconceived ideas scattered to the four winds.",go sleep night sort dreamy hazy impression school place great deal order many kind sympathising face agreeable go sleep impression drop sort medley find vast new world certain personage exercise strong moral influence whole number other person do pleased awoke morning find preconceived idea scatter wind 
3,"There was nothing of apparent liberty about the Lavender House arrangements in the early morning hours.  In the first, place, it seemed quite the middle of the night when Hester was awakened by a loud gong, which clanged through the house and caused her to sit up in bed in a considerable state of fright and perplexity.  A moment or two later a neatly-dressed maid-servant came into the room with a can of hot water; she lit a pair of candles on the mantelpiece, and, with the remark that the second gong would sound in half an hour, and that all the young ladies would be expected to assemble in the chapel at seven o'clock precisely, she left the room.",be apparent liberty arrangement early morning hour first place seem middle night awaken loud gong clange house cause sit bed considerable state fright perplexity moment dress maid servant come room can hot water light pair candle mantelpiece remark second gong sound hour young lady expect assemble chapel o'clock leave room 
4,"Hester pulled her pretty little gold watch from under her pillow, and saw with a sigh that it was now half-past six.",pull little gold watch pillow see sigh half past 
5,"""What odious hours they keep in this horrid place!"" she said to herself. ""Well, well, I always did know that school would be unendurable.""",odious hour keep horrid place say know school unendurable 
6,"She waited for five minutes before she got up, and then she dressed herself languidly, and, if the truth must be told, in a very untidy fashion.  She managed to be dressed by the time the second gong sounded, but she had only one moment to give to her private prayers.  She reflected, however, that this did not greatly matter as she was going down to prayers immediately in the chapel.",wait minute get dress truth tell untidy fashion manage dress time second gong sound have moment give private prayer reflect matter go prayer chapel 
7,"The service in the chapel the night before had impressed her more deeply than she cared to own, and she followed her companions downstairs with a certain feeling of pleasure at the thought of again seeing Mr Everard and Mrs Willis.  She wondered if they would take much notice of her this morning, and she thought it just possible that Mr Everard, who had looked at her so compassionately the night before, might be induced, for the sake of his old friendship with her mother, to take her home with him to spend the day.  She thought she would rather like to spend a day with Mr Everard, and she fancied he was the sort of person who would influence her and help her to be good.  Hester fancied that if some very interesting and quite out of the common person took her in hand, she might be formed into something extremely noble--noble enough even to forgive Annie Forest.",service chapel night impress care own follow companion certain feeling pleasure thought see wonder take much notice morning think possible look night induce sake old friendship mother take home spend day think like spend day fancy sort person influence help good fancy interesting common person take hand form noble noble forgive 
8,"The girls all filed into the chapel, which was lighted as brightly and cheerily as the night before; but Hester found herself placed on a bench far down in the building.  She was no longer in the place of honour by Mrs Willis's side.  She was one of a number, and no one looked particularly at her or noticed her in any way.  A shy young curate read the morning prayers; Mr Everard was not present, and Mrs Willis, who was, walked out of the chapel when prayers were over without even glancing in Hester's direction.  This was bad enough for the poor little dreamer of dreams, but worse was to follow.",girl file chapel light night find place bench building place honour side number look notice way shy young curate read morning prayer present walk chapel prayer glance direction bad poor little dreamer dream bad follow 
9,"Mrs Willis did not speak to Hester, but she did stop for an instant beside Annie Forest.  Hester saw her lay her white hand on the young girl's shoulder and whisper for an instant in her ear.  Annie's lovely gipsy face flushed a vivid crimson.",speak stop instant see lay white hand young girl shoulder whisper instant ear lovely gipsy face flush vivid crimson 
10,"""For your sake, darling,"" she whispered back; but Hester caught the words, and was consumed by a fierce jealousy.",sake darling whisper catch word consume fierce jealousy 
11,"The girls went into the school-room, where Mdlle.  Perier gave a French lesson to the upper class.  Hester belonged to no class at present, and could look around her, and have plenty of time to reflect on her own miseries, and particularly on what she now considered the favouritism shown by Mrs Willis.",girl go school room give french lesson upper class belong class present look have plenty time reflect own misery consider favouritism show 
12,"""Mr Everard at least will read through that girl,"" she said to herself; ""he could not possibly endure any one so loud.  Yes, I am sure that my only friend at home, Cecilia Day, would call Annie very loud.  I wonder Mrs Willis can endure her.  Mrs Willis seems so ladylike herself, but--Oh, I beg your pardon, what's the matter?""",least read girl say endure one loud sure only friend home call wonder endure seem ladylike beg pardon matter 
13,A very sharp voice had addressed itself to the idle Hester.,sharp voice address idle 
14,"""But, mademoiselle, you are doing nothing!  This cannot for a moment be permitted.  Pardonnez-moi, you know not the French?  Here is a little easy lesson.  Study it, mademoiselle, and don't let your eyes wander a moment from the page.""",do moment permit know little easy lesson study let eye wander moment page 
15,"Hester favoured Mdlle.  Perier with a look of lofty contempt, but she received the well-thumbed lesson-book in absolute silence.",favour look lofty contempt receive thumb lesson book absolute silence 
16,"At eight o'clock came breakfast, which was nicely served, and was very good and abundant.  Hester was thoroughly hungry this morning, and did not feel so shy as the night before.  She found herself seated between two strange girls, who talked to her a little and would have made themselves friendly had she at all encouraged them to do so.  After breakfast came half an hour's recreation, when, the weather being very bad, the girls again assembled in the cosy play-room.  Hester looked round eagerly for Cecil Temple, who greeted her with a kind smile, but did not ask her into her inclosure.  Annie Forest was not present, and Hester breathed a sigh of relief at her absence.  The half-hour devoted to recreation proved rather dull to the newcomer.  Hester could not understand her present world.  To the girl who had been brought up practically as an only child in the warm shelter of a home, the ways and doings of school-girl life were an absolute enigma.",o'clock come breakfast serve good abundant hungry morning feel shy night find seat strange girl talk little make friendly encourage do breakfast come hour recreation weather bad girl assemble cosy play room look greet kind smile ask inclosure present breathe sigh relief absence half hour devote recreation prove dull newcomer understand present world girl bring only child warm shelter home way doing school girl life absolute enigma 
17,"Hester had no idea of unbending or of making herself agreeable.  The girls voted her to one another stiff and tiresome, and quickly left her to her own devices.  She looked longingly at Cecil Temple; but Cecil, who could never be knowingly unkind to any one, was seizing the precious moments to write a letter to her father, and Hester presently wandered down the room and tried to take an interest in the little ones.  From twelve to fifteen quite little children were in the school, and Hester wondered with a sort of vague half-pain if she might see any child among the group the least like Nan.",have idea unbending make agreeable girl vote stiff tiresome leave own device look unkind one seize precious moment write letter father wander room try take interest little one little child school wonder sort vague half pain see child group least 
18,"""They will like to have me with them,"" she said to herself.  ""Poor little dots, they always like big girls to notice them, and didn't they make a fuss about Miss Forest last night!  Well, Nan is fond enough of me, and little children find out so quickly what one is really like.""",like have say poor little dot like big girl notice make fuss last night fond enough little child find one 
19,"Hester walked boldly into the group.  The little dots were all as busy as bees, were not the least lonely, or the least shy, and very plainly gave the intruder to understand that they would prefer her room to her company.  Hester was not proud with little children--she loved them dearly.  Some of the smaller ones in question were beautiful little creatures, and her heart warmed to them for Nan's sake.  She could not stoop to conciliate the older girls, but she could make an effort with the babies.  She knelt on the floor and took up a headless doll.",walk group little dot busy bee least lonely least shy give intruder understand prefer room company proud little child love small one question beautiful little creature heart warm sake stake conciliate old girl make effort baby knolt floor take headless doll

25,"""Oh, it was taken to a hospital, and got back its head,"" said Hester quite cheerfully; ""it became quite well again, and was a more beautiful doll than ever.""",take hospital get head say become beautiful doll 
26,"This announcement caused intense wonder and was certainly carrying the interest of all the little ones.  Hester was deciding that the child who possessed the headless doll _had_ a look of Nan about her dark brown eyes, when suddenly there was a diversion--the play-room door was opened noisily, banged-to with a very loud report, and a gay voice sang out--",announcement cause intense wonder carry interest little one decide child possess headless doll _had_ look dark brown eye be diversion play room door open bang loud report gay voice sing

29,"""Here comes Annie!""",come 
30,"Annie Forest was surrounded, and Hester knelt alone on the hearth-rug.",surround knolt hearth rug 
31,"She felt herself colouring painfully--she did not fail to observe that two laughing eyes had fixed themselves with a momentary triumph on her face; then, snatching up a book, which happened to lie close, she seated herself with her back to all the girls, and her head bent over the page. It is quite doubtful whether she saw any of the words, but she was at least determined not to cry.",feel colour fail observe laugh eye fix momentary triumph face snatch book happen lie seat girl head bend page doubtful see word least determined cry 
32,"The half-hour so wearisome to poor Hester came to an end, and the girls, conducted by Miss Danesbury, filed into the school-room and took their places in the different classes.",half hour wearisome poor come end girl conduct file school room take place different class 
33,"Work had now begun in serious earnest.  The school-room presented an animated and busy scene.  The young faces with their varying expressions betokened on the whole the preponderance of an earnest spirit. Discipline, not too severe, reigned triumphant.",work begin serious earnest school room present animated busy scene young face vary expression betoken whole preponderance earnest spirit discipline severe reign triumphant 
34,"Hester was not yet appointed to any place among these busy workers, but while she stood wondering, a little confused, and half intending to drop into an empty seat which happened to be close, Miss Danesbury came up to her.",appoint place busy worker stand wonder little confused half intend drop empty seat happen close come 
35,"""Follow me, Miss Thornton,"" she said, and she conducted the young girl up the whole length of the great school-room, and pushed aside some baize curtains which concealed a second smaller room, where Mrs Willis sat before a desk.",follow say conduct young girl whole length great school room push baize curtain conceal second small room sit desk 
36,"The head-mistress was no longer dressed in soft pearl-grey and Mechlin lace.  She wore a black silk dress, and her white cap seemed to Hester to add a severe tone to her features.  She neither shook hands with the new pupil nor kissed her, but said instantly in a bright though authoritative tone--",head mistress dress soft pearl grey lace wear black silk dress white cap seem add severe tone feature shake hand new pupil kiss say bright authoritative tone 
37,"""I must now find out as quickly as possible what you know, Hester, in order to place you in the most suitable class.""  Hester was a clever girl, and passed through the ordeal of a rather stiff examination with considerable ability.  Mrs Willis pronounced her English and general information quite up to the usual standard for girls of her age--her French was deficient, but she showed some talent for German.",find possible know order place suitable class clever girl pass ordeal stiff examination considerable ability pronounce general information usual standard girl age deficient show talent 
38,"""On the whole I am pleased with your general intelligence, and I think you have good capacities, Hester,"" she said in conclusion.  ""I shall ask Miss Good, our very accomplished English teacher, to place you in the third-class.  You will have to work very hard, however, at your French, to maintain your place there.  But Mdlle.  Perier is kind and painstaking, and it rests with yourself to quickly acquire a conversational acquaintance with the language.  You are aware that, except during recreation, you are never allowed to speak in any other tongue.  Now, go back to the school-room, my dear.""",whole pleased general intelligence think have good capacity say conclusion ask accomplish english teacher place third class have work maintain place kind painstaking rest acquire conversational acquaintance language aware recreation allow speak other tongue go school room dear

41,"""Is it about your lessons?""",lesson 
42,"""No--oh, no; it is--""",
43,"""Then pardon me, my dear,"" uttered the governess, ""I sit in my room every evening from eight to half-past, and I am then at liberty to see a pupil on any subject which is not trifling.  Nothing but lessons are spoken of in lesson hours, Hester.  Ah, here comes Miss Good.  Miss Good, I should wish you to place Hester Thornton in the third-class. Her English is up to the average.  I will see Mdlle.  Perier about her at twelve o'clock.""",pardon dear utter governess sit room evening half past liberty see pupil subject trifling lesson speak lesson hour come wish place third class average see o'clock 
44,"Hester followed the English teacher into the great school-room, took her place in the third-class, at the desk which was pointed out to her, was given a pile of new books, and was asked to attend to the history lesson which was then going on.",follow english teacher great school room take place third class desk point give pile new book ask attend history lesson go 
45,"Notwithstanding her confusion, a certain sense of soreness, and some indignation at what she considered Mrs Willis's altered manner, she acquitted herself with considerable spirit, and was pleased to see that her class companions regarded her with some respect.",confusion certain sense soreness indignation consider alter manner acquitt considerable spirit pleased see class companion regard respect 
46,"An English literature lecture followed the history, and here again Hester acquitted herself with _eclat_.  The subject to-day was ""Julius Caesar,"" and Hester had read Shakespeare's play over many times with her mother.",english literature lecture follow history acquitt subject day read play many time mother 
47,"But when the hour came for foreign languages, her brief triumph ceased. Lower and lower did she fall in her school-fellows' estimation, as she stumbled through her truly English-French.  Mdlle.  Perier, who was a very fiery little woman, almost screamed at her--the girls coloured and nearly tittered.  Hester hoped to recover her lost laurels in German, but by this time her head ached, and she did very little better in the German which she loved than in the French which she detested.  At twelve o'clock she was relieved to find that school was over for the present, and she heard the English teacher's voice desiring the girls to go quickly to their rooms, and to assemble in five minutes' time in the great stone hall, equipped for their walk.",hour come foreign language brief triumph cease lower low fall school fellows' estimation stumble fiery little woman scream girl coloured titter hope recover lose laurel time head ach do little good love detest o'clock relieve find school present hear english teacher voice desire girl go room assemble minute time great stone hall equip walk 
48,"The walk lasted for a little over an hour, and was a very dreary penance to poor Hester, as she was neither allowed to run, race, nor talk a word of English.  She sighed heavily once or twice, and several of the girls who looked at her curiously agreed with Annie Forest that she was decidedly sulky.  The walk was followed by dinner; then came half an hour of recreation in the delightful play-room, and eager chattering in the English tongue.",walk last little hour dreary penance poor allow run race talk word sigh several girl look agree sulky walk follow dinner come hour recreation delightful play room eager chattering english tongue 
49,"At three o'clock the school assembled once more; but now the studies were of a less severe character, and Hester spent one of her first happy half-hours over a drawing lesson.  She had a great love for drawing, and felt some pride in the really beautiful copy which she was making of the stump of an old gnarled oak-tree.  Her dismay, however, was proportionately great when the drawing-master drew his pencil right across her copy.",o'clock school assemble more study severe character spend first happy half hour draw lesson have great love draw feel pride beautiful copy make stump old gnarled oak tree dismay great draw master draw pencil copy

51,"""This is my first day at school,"" whispered back poor Hester, speaking in English in her distress.  Whereupon the master smiled, and even forgot to report her for her transgression of the French tongue.",first day school whisper poor speak distress master smile forget report transgression french tongue 
52,"Hester spent the rest of that afternoon over her music lesson.  The music-master was an irascible little German, but Hester played with some taste, and was therefore not too severely rapped over the knuckles.",spend rest afternoon music lesson music master irascible little play taste rapp knuckle 
53,"Then came tea and another half-hour of recreation, which was followed by two silent hours in the school-room, each girl bent busily over her books in preparation for the next day's work.  Hester studied hard, for she had made up her mind to be the intellectual prodigy of the school. Even on this first day, miserable as it was, she had won a few plaudits for her quickness and powers of observation.  How much better could she work when she had really fallen into the tone of the school, and understood the lessons which she was now so carefully preparing!  During her busy day she had failed to notice one thing: namely, the absence of Annie Forest.  Annie had not been in the school-room, had not been in the play-room; but now, as the clock struck eight, she entered the school-room with a listless expression, and took her place in the same class with Hester.  Her eyes were heavy, as if she had been crying, and when a companion touched her, and gave her a sympathising glance, she shook her head with a sorrowful gesture, but did not speak.  Glasses of milk and slices of bread and butler were now handed round to the girls, and Miss Danesbury asked if any one would like to see Mrs Willis before prayers.  Hester half sprang to her feet, but then sat down again.  Mrs Willis had annoyed her by refusing to break her rules and answer her question during lesson hours.  No, the silly child resolved that she would not trouble Mrs Willis now.",come tea half hour recreation follow silent hour school room girl bend book preparation next day work study make mind intellectual prodigy school first day miserable win few plaudit quickness power observation good work fall tone school understand lesson prepare busy day fail notice thing absence school room play room clock strike enter school room listless expression take place same class eye heavy cry companion touch give sympathise glance shake head sorrowful gesture speak glasse milk slice bread butler hand girl ask one like see prayer half spring foot sit annoy refuse break rule answer question lesson hour silly child resolve trouble
