3," Paul never quite knew how the remainder of that day passed at Crichton House. He was ordered to join a class which was more or less engaged with some kind of work: he had a hazy idea that it was Latin, though it may have been Greek; but he was spared the necessity of taking any active part in the proceedings, as Mr. Blinkhorn was not disposed to be too exacting with a boy who in one short morning had endured a sentence of expulsion, a lecture, the immediate prospect of a flogging, and a paternal visit, and, as before, mercifully left him alone.",know remainder day pass order join class engage kind work have hazy idea greek spare necessity take active part proceedings dispose exact boy short morning endure sentence expulsion lecture immediate prospect flog paternal visit leave 
4,"His classmates, however, did not show the same chivalrous delicacy; and Paul had to suffer many unmannerly jests and gibes at his expense, frequent and anxious inquiries as to the exact nature of his treatment in the dining-room, with sundry highly imaginative versions of the same, while there was much candid and unbiassed comment on the appearance and conduct of himself and his son.",classmate show same chivalrous delicacy have suffer many unmannerly jest gibe expense frequent anxious inquiry exact nature treatment dining room sundry imaginative version same be much candid unbiassed comment appearance conduct son 
5,"But he bore it unprotesting--or, rather, he scarcely noticed it; for all his thoughts were now entirely taken up by one important subject--the time and manner of his escape.",bear unprotest notice thought take important subject time manner escape 
6,"Thanks to Dick's thoughtless liberality, he had now ample funds to carry him safely home. It was hardly likely that any more unexpected claims could be brought against him now, particularly as he had no intention of publishing his return to solvency. He might reasonably consider himself in a position to make his escape at the very first favourable opportunity.",thanks thoughtless liberality have ample fund carry likely unexpected claim bring have intention publish return solvency consider position make escape very first favourable opportunity 
7,"When would that opportunity present itself? It must come soon. He could not wait long for it. Any hour might yet see him pounced upon and flogged heartily for some utterly unknown and unsuspected transgression; or the golden key which would unlock his prison bars might be lost in some unlucky moment; for his long series of reverses had made him loth to trust to Fortune, even when she seemed to look smilingly once more upon him.",opportunity present come wait hour see pounce flogge unknown unsuspected transgression golden key unlock prison bar lose unlucky moment long series reverse make trust seem look 
8,Fortune's countenance is apt to be so alarmingly mobile with some unfortunates.,countenance apt mobile unfortunate 
9,"But in spite of the new facilities given him for escape, and his strong motives for taking advantage of them, he soon found to his utter dismay that he shrank from committing himself to so daring and dangerous a course, just as much as when he had tried to make a confidant of the Doctor.",spite new facility give escape strong motive take advantage find utter dismay shrank commit dare dangerous course much try make confidant 
10,"For, after all, could he be sure of himself? Would his ill-luck suffer him to seize the one propitious moment, or would that fatal self-distrust and doubt that had paralysed him for the past week seize him again just at the crisis?",sure ill luck suffer seize propitious moment fatal self distrust doubt paralyse past week seize crisis 
11,"Suppose he did venture to take the first irrevocable step, could he rely on himself to go through the rest of his hazardous enterprise? Was he cool and wary enough? He dared not expect an uninterrupted run. Had he ruses and expedients at command on any sudden check?",suppose venture take first irrevocable step rely go rest hazardous enterprise cool wary expect uninterrupted run ruse expedient command sudden check 
12,"If he could not answer all these doubts favourably, was it not sheer madness to take to flight at all?",answer doubt sheer madness take flight 
13,"He felt a dismal conviction that his success would have to depend, not on his own cunning, but on the forbearance or blindness of others. The slightest _contretemps_ must infallibly upset him altogether.",feel dismal conviction success have depend own cunning forbearance blindness other slight _contretemps_ upset 
14,"The fact was, he had all his life been engaged in the less eventful and contentious branches of commerce. His will had seldom had to come in contact with others, and when it did so, he had found means, being of a prudent and cautious temperament, of avoiding disagreeable personal consequences by timely compromises or judicious employment of delegates. He had generally found his fellow-men ready to meet him reasonably as an equal or a superior.",fact have life engage eventful contentious branch commerce will have come contact other find means prudent cautious temperament avoid disagreeable personal consequence timely compromise judicious employment delegate find fellow man ready meet equal superior 
15,"But now he must be prepared to see in everyone he met a possible enemy, who would hand him over to the tyrant on the faintest suspicion. They were spies to be baffled or disarmed, pursuers to be eluded. The smallest slip in his account of himself would be enough to undo him.",prepare see meet possible enemy hand tyrant faintest suspicion spy baffle disarm pursuer elude small slip account enough undo 
16,"No wonder that, as he thought over all this, his heart quailed within him.",wonder think heart quail 
17,"They say--the paradox-mongers say--that it requires a far higher degree of moral courage for a soldier in action to leave the ranks under fire and seek a less distinguished position towards the rear, than would carry him on with the rest to charge a battery.",say paradox monger say require high degree moral courage soldier action leave rank fire seek distinguished position rear carry rest charge battery 
18,"This may be true, though it might not prove a very valuable defence at a court-martial; but, at all events, Mr. Bultitude found, when it came to the point, that it was almost impossible for him to screw up his courage to run away.",true prove valuable defence court martial event find come point impossible screw courage run 
19,"It is not a pleasant state, this indecision whether to stay passively and risk the worst or avoid it by flight, and the worst of it is that, whatever course is eventually forced upon us, it finds us equally unprepared, and more liable from such indecision to bungle miserably in the sequel.",pleasant state indecision stay risk bad avoid flight bad course force find unprepared liable such indecision bungle sequel 
20,"Paul might never have gained heart to venture, but for an unpleasant incident that took place during dinner and a discovery he made after it.",gain heart venture unpleasant incident take place dinner discovery make 
21,"They happened to have a particularly unpopular pudding that day; a pallid preparation of suet, with an infrequent currant or two embalmed in it, and Paul was staring at his portion of this delicacy disconsolately enough, wondering how he should contrive to consume and, worse still, digest it, when his attention was caught by Jolland, who sat directly opposite him.",happen have unpopular pudding day pallid preparation suet infrequent currant embalm stare portion delicacy wonder contrive consume bad digest attention catch sit 
22,"That young gentleman, who evidently shared the general prejudice against the currant pudding, was inviting Mr. Bultitude's attention to a little contrivance of his own for getting rid of it, which consisted in delicately shovelling the greater part of what was on his plate into a large envelope held below the table to receive it.",young gentleman share general prejudice currant pudding invite attention little contrivance own get rid consist shovell great part plate large envelope hold table receive 
23,"This struck Paul as a heaven-sent method of avoiding the difficulty, and he had just got the envelope which had held Barbara's letter out of his pocket, intending to follow Jolland's example, when the Doctor's voice made him start guiltily and replace the envelope in his pocket.",strike heaven send method avoid difficulty get envelope hold letter pocket intend follow example voice make start replace envelope pocket

26,"""What is in that envelope?"" said the Doctor, who happened to have been watching him.",envelope say happen watch 
27,"""In the envelope, sir? Pudding, sir,"" said Jolland, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to send bulky portions of pudding by post.",envelope sir pudding sir say natural thing world send bulky portion pudding post 
28,"""And why did you place pudding in the envelope?"" inquired the Doctor in his deepest tone.",place pudding envelope inquire deep tone 
29,"Jolland felt a difficulty in explaining that he had done so because he wished to avoid eating it, and with a view to interring it later on in the playground: he preferred silence.",feel difficulty explain do wish avoid eat view interr playground prefer silence 
30,"""Shall I tell you why you did it, sir?"" thundered the Doctor. ""You did it, because you were scheming to obtain a second portion--because you did not feel yourself able to eat both portions at your leisure here, and thought to put by a part to devour in secret at a future time. It's a most painful exhibition of pure piggishness. There shall be no pocketing at this table, sir. You will eat that pudding under my eye at once, and you will stay in and write out French verbs for two days. That will put an end to any more gorging in the garden for a time, at least.""",tell do sir thunder do schem obtain second portion feel able eat portion leisure think put part devour secret future time painful exhibition pure piggishness be pocketing table sir eat pudding eye stay write french verb day put end more gorg garden time least 
31,"Jolland seemed stupefied, though relieved, by the unexpected construction put upon his conduct, as he gulped down the intercepted fragments of pudding, while the rest diligently cleared their plates with as much show of appreciation as they could muster.",seem stupefy relieve unexpected construction put conduct gulp intercept fragment pudding rest clear plate much show appreciation muster 
32,"Mr. Bultitude shuddered at this one more narrow escape. If he had been detected--as he must have been in another instant--in smuggling pudding in an envelope he might have incautiously betrayed his real motives, and then, as the Doctor was morbidly sensitive concerning all complaints of the fare he provided, he would have got into worse trouble than the unfortunate Jolland, to say nothing of the humiliation of being detected in such an act.",shudder narrow escape detect instant smuggling pudding envelope betray real motive sensitive concern complaint fare provide get bad trouble unfortunate say humiliation detect act 
33,"It was a solemn warning to him of the dangers he was exposed to hourly, while he lingered within those walls; but his position was still more strongly brought home to him by the terrible discovery he made shortly afterwards.",solemn warning danger expose linger wall position bring terrible discovery make 
34,"He was alone in the schoolroom, for the others had all gone down into the playground, except Jolland, who was confined in one of the class-rooms below, when the thought came over him to test the truth of Dick's hint about a name cut on the Doctor's writing-table.",alone schoolroom other go playground confine class room thought come test truth hint name cut writing table 
35,"He stole up to it guiltily, and, lifting the slanting desk which stood there, examined the surface below. Dick had been perfectly correct. There it was, glaringly fresh and distinct, not large but very deeply cut and fearfully legible. ""R. Bultitude."" It might have been done that day. Dick had probably performed it out of bravado, or under the impression that he was not going to return after the holidays.",steal lift slant desk stand examine surface correct fresh distinct large cut legible do day perform bravado impression go return holiday 
36,"Paul dropped the desk over the fatal letters with a shudder. The slightest accidental shifting of it must disclose them--nothing but a miracle could have kept them concealed so long. When they did come to light, he knew from what he had seen of the Doctor, that the act would be considered as an outrage of the blackest and most desperate kind. He would most unquestionably get a flogging for it!",drop desk fatal letter shudder slight accidental shifting disclose miracle keep conceal come light know see act consider outrage blackest desperate kind get flog 
37,"He fetched a large pewter ink-pot, and tried nervously to blacken the letters with the tip of a quill, to make them, if possible, rather less obtrusive than they were. All in vain; they only stood out with more startling vividness when picked out in black upon the brown-stained deal. He felt very like a conscience-stricken murderer trying to hide a corpse that _wouldn't_ be buried. He gave it up at last, having only made a terrible mess with the ink.",fetched large pewter ink pot try black letter tip quill make possible obtrusive vain stand startling vividness pick black brown stain deal feel conscience stricken murderer try hide corpse bury give last make terrible mess ink 
38,"That settled it. He must fly. The flogging must be avoided at all hazards. If an opportunity delayed its coming, why, he must do without the opportunity--he must make one. For good or ill, his mind was made up now for immediate flight.",settle fly flog avoid hazard opportunity delay coming do opportunity make good ill mind make immediate flight 
39,"All that afternoon, while he sat trying to keep his mind upon long sums in Bills of Parcels, which disgusted him as a business man, by the glaring improbability of their details, his eye wandered furtively down the long tables to where the Doctor sat at the head of the class. Every chance movement of the principal's elbow filled him with a sickening dread. A hundred times did those rudely carved letters seem about to start forth and denounce him.",afternoon sit try keep mind long sum disgust business man glaring improbability detail eye wander long table sit head class chance movement principal elbow fill sickening dread time carve letter seem about start denounce 
40,It was a disquieting afternoon for Paul.,disquieting afternoon 
41,"But the time dragged wearily on, and still the desk loyally kept its secret. The dusk drew on and the gas-burners were lit. The younger boys came up from the lower class-room and were sent out to play; the Doctor shortly afterwards dismissed his own class to follow them, and Paul and his companions had the room to themselves.",time drag desk keep secret dusk draw gas burner light young boy come low class room send play dismiss own class follow companion have room 
42,"He sat there on the rough form with his slate before him, hearing half-unconsciously the shouts, laughter, and ring of feet coming up from the darkness outside, and the faint notes of a piano, which filtered through the double doors from one of the rooms, where a boy was practising Haydn's ""Surprise,"" from Hamilton's exercise book, a surprise which he rendered as a mildly interjectional form of astonishment.",sit rough form slate hear half shout laughter ring foot come darkness faint note piano filter double door room boy practise exercise book surprise render interjectional form astonishment 
43,"All the time Paul was racked with an intense burning desire to get up and run for it then, before it became too late; but cold fits of doubt and fear preserved him from such lunacy--he would wait, his chance might come before long.",time rack intense burning desire get run become late cold fit doubt fear preserve such lunacy wait chance come long 
44,"His patience was rewarded; the Doctor came in, looking at his watch, and said, ""I think these boys have had enough of it, Mr. Tinkler, eh? You can send them out now till tea-time.""",patience reward come look watch say think boy have enough send tea time 
45,"Mr. Tinkler, who had been entangling himself frightfully in intricate calculations upon the blackboard, without making a single convert, was only too glad to take advantage of the suggestion, and Paul followed the rest into the playground with a sense of relief.",entangle intricate calculation blackboard make single convert glad take advantage suggestion follow rest playground sense relief 
46,"The usual ""chevy"" was going on there, with more spirit than usual, perhaps, because the darkness allowed of practical jokes and surprises, and offered great facilities for paying off old grudges with secrecy and despatch, and as the Doctor had come to the door of the greenhouse, and was looking on, the players exerted themselves still more, till the ""prison"" to which most of one side had been consigned by being run down and touched by their fleeter enemies was filled with a long line of captives holding hands and calling out to be released.",usual chevy go more spirit usual darkness allow practical joke surprise offer great facility pay old grudge secrecy despatch come door greenhouse look player exert prison most side consign run touch fleeter enemy fill long line captive hold hand call release 
47,"Paul, who had run out vaguely from his base, was promptly pursued and made prisoner by an unnecessarily vigorous thump in the back, after which he took his place at the bottom of the line of imprisoned ones.",run base pursue make prisoner vigorous thump back take place bottom line imprison one 
48,"But the enemy's spirit began to slacken; one after another of the players still left to the opposite side succeeded in outrunning pursuit and touching the foremost prisoner for the time being, so as to set him free by the rules of the game. The Doctor went in again, and the enemy relapsed as usual into total indifference, so that Paul, without exactly knowing how, soon found himself the only one left in gaol, unnoticed and apparently forgotten.",enemy spirit begin slack player leave opposite side succeed outrunn pursuit touch foremost prisoner time set free rule game go enemy relaps usual total indifference know find only one leave gaol unnoticed forget 
49,"He could not see anything through the darkness, but he heard the voices of the boys disputing at the other side of the playground; he looked round; at his right was the indistinct form of a large laurel bush, behind that he knew was the playground gate. Could it be that his chance had come at last?",see darkness hear voice boy dispute other side playground look right indistinct form large laurel bush know playground gate chance come last 
50,"He slipped behind the laurel and waited, holding his breath; the dispute still went on; no one seemed to have noticed him, probably the darkness prevented all chance of that; he went on tip-toe to the gate--it was not locked.",slip laurel wait hold breath dispute go seem notice darkness prevent chance go tip toe gate lock 
51,"He opened it very carefully a little way; it was forbearing enough not to creak, and the next moment he was outside, free to go where he would!",open little way forbear creak next moment free go 
52,"Escape, after all, was simple enough when he came to try it; he could hardly believe at first that he really was free at last; free with money enough in his pocket to take him home, with the friendly darkness to cover his retreat; free to go back and confront Dick on his own ground, and, by force, or fraud, get the Garudâ Stone into his own hands once more.",escape simple come try believe first free last free money pocket take friendly darkness cover retreat free go confront own ground force fraud get own hand more 
53,"As yet he never doubted that it would be easy enough to convince his household, if necessary, of the truth of his story, and enlist them one and all on his side; all that he required, he thought, was caution; he must reach the house unobserved, and wait and watch, and the deuce would be in it if the stone were not safe in his pocket again before twelve hours had gone by.",doubt easy convince household necessary truth story enlist side require think caution reach house unobserve wait watch deuce stone safe pocket hour go 
54,"All this time he was still within a hundred yards or so of the playground wall; he must decide upon some particular route, some definite method of ordering his flight; to stay where he was any longer would clearly be unwise, yet, where should he go first?",time yard playground wall decide particular route definite method order flight stay unwise go 
55,"If he went to the station at once, how could he tell that he should be lucky enough to catch a train without having to wait long for it, and unless he did that, he would almost certainly be sought for first on the station platform, and might be caught before a train was due?",go station tell lucky catch train have wait do seek first station platform catch train due 
56,"At last, with an astuteness he had not suspected himself of possessing, which was probably the result of the harrowing experiences he had lately undergone, he hit upon a plan of action. ""I'll go to a shop,"" he thought, ""and change this sovereign, and ask to look at a timetable--then, if I find I can catch a train at once, I'll run for it; if one is not due for some time, I can hang about near the station till it comes in.""",last astuteness suspect possess result harrowing experience undergone hit plan action go shop think change sovereign ask look timetable find catch train run due time hang station come 
57,"With this intention he walked on towards the town till he came to a small terrace of shops, when he went into the first, which was a stationer's and toy-dealer's, with a stock in trade of cheap wooden toys and incomprehensible games, drawing slates, penny packets of stationery and cards of pen and pencil-holders, and a particularly stuffy atmosphere; the proprietor, a short man with a fat white face with a rich glaze all over it and a fringe of ragged brown whisker meeting under his chin, was sitting behind the counter posting up his ledger.",intention walk town come small terrace shop go first stationer toy dealer stock trade cheap wooden toy incomprehensible game draw slate penny packet stationery card pen pencil holder stuffy atmosphere proprietor short man fat white face rich glaze fringe ragged brown whisker meeting chin sit counter post ledger 
58,"Paul looked round the shop in search of something to purchase, and at last said, more nervously than he expected to do, ""I want a pencil-case, one which screws up and down."" He thought a pencil-case would be an innocent, unsuspicious thing to ask for. The man set rows of cards containing pencil-cases of every imaginable shape on the counter before him, and when Mr. Bultitude had chosen and paid for one, the stationer asked if there would be anything else, and if he might send it for him. ""You're one of Dr. Grimstone's young gentlemen up at Crichton House, aren't you, sir?"" he added.",look shop search purchase last say expect do want pencil case screw think pencil case innocent unsuspicious thing ask man set row card contain pencil case imaginable shape counter choose pay stationer ask be else send young gentleman sir add

60,"""Certainly, sir; expectin' some one to-night or to-morrow p'raps. Let me see,"" he said, consulting a table which hung behind him.

Don't be afraid of my telling no tales. I've bin a schoolboy myself in my time, bless your 'art. I shouldn't wonder now if I couldn't make a pretty good guess without telling at what you're after.

73,"He ran on, past a series of villa residences enclosed in varnished palings and adorned with that mediæval abundance of turrets, balconies, and cheap stained-glass, which is accepted nowadays as a guarantee of the tenant's culture, and a satisfactory substitute for effective drainage. After the villas came a church, and a few yards farther on the road turned with a sharp curve into the main thoroughfare leading to the station.",run series villa residence enclose varnish paling adorn mediæval abundance turret balcony cheap stain glass accept guarantee tenant culture satisfactory substitute effective drainage villa come church few yard road turn sharp curve main thoroughfare lead station

He was saved, in sight of haven at last!",hear shrill engine whistle bang truck railway siding echoe neighbour house save sight haven last

87,"This was at least a move in the right direction; for the three began at once to retrace their steps. But, unfortunately, all these explanations had taken time, and before they had gone many yards, Mr. Bultitude was horrified to hear the station-bell ring loudly, and immediately after a cloud of white steam rose above the station roof as the London train clanked cumbrously in, and was brought to with a prolonged screeching of brakes.",least move right direction begin retrace step explanation take time go many yard horrify hear station bell ring cloud white steam rise station roof train clank bring prolonged screeching brake

There was time for that, too. No one was at the pigeon-hole but one old lady.",late train platform engine get steam dull roar risk detection travel ticket be time pigeon hole old lady 
93,"But, unhappily, the old lady considered taking a ticket as a solemn rite to be performed with all due caution and deliberation.
