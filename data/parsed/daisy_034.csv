5,"Flora was sleeping at the Grange, to be ready for action in the morning, and Ethel was to go early with Mary and Blanche, who were frantic to have a share in the selling. Norman and the boys were to walk at their own time, and the children to be brought later by Miss Bracy. The doctor would be bound by no rules.",sleep ready action morning go frantic have share sell boy walk own time child bring doctor bind rule 
6,"It was a pattern day, bright, clear, warm, and not oppressive, perfect for an out-of-doors fete; and Ethel had made up her mind to fulfil her promise to Margaret of enjoying herself. In the brilliant sunshine, and between two such happy sisters, it would have been surly, indeed, not to enter into the spirit of the day; and Ethel laughed gaily with them, and at their schemes and hopes; Blanche’s heart being especially set on knowing the fate of a watch-guard of her own construction.",pattern day bright clear warm oppressive perfect door fete make mind fulfil promise enjoy brilliant sunshine such happy sister surly enter spirit day laugh scheme hope heart set know fate watch guard own construction 
7,"Hearing that the ladies were in the gardens, they repaired thither at once. The broad, smooth bowling-green lay before them; a marquee, almost converted into a bower, bounding it on either side, while in the midst arose, gorgeous and delicious, a pyramid of flowers--contributions from all the hot-houses in the neighbourhood--to be sold for the benefit of the bazaar. Their freshness and fragrance gave a brightness to the whole scene, while shrinking from such light, as only the beauteous works of nature could bear, was the array accomplished by female fingers.",hear lady garden repair broad smooth bowling green lay marquee convert bower bound side midst arise gorgeous delicious pyramid flower contribution hot house neighbourhood sell benefit bazaar freshness fragrance give brightness whole scene shrink such light beauteous work nature bear array accomplish female finger 
8,"Under the wreathed canopies were the stalls, piled up with bright colours, most artistically arranged. Ethel, with her over-minute knowledge of every article, could hardly believe that yonder glowing Eastern pattern of scarlet, black, and blue, was, in fact, a judicious mosaic of penwipers that she remembered, as shreds begged from the tailor, that the delicate lace-work consisted of Miss Bracy’s perpetual antimacassars, and that the potichomanie could look so dignified and Etruscan.",wreathe canopy stall pile bright colour arrange minute knowledge article believe yonder glow eastern pattern scarlet black blue fact judicious mosaic penwiper remember shred begg tailor delicate lace work consist perpetual antimacassar potichomanie look dignified etruscan

11,“But where’s Flora?--where’s my watch-guard?” anxiously asked Blanche.,watch guard ask 
12,"“She was here just now,” said Meta, looking round. “What a genius she is, Ethel! She worked wonders all yesterday, and let the Miss Hoxtons think it was all their own doing, and she was out before six this morning, putting finishing touches.”",say look genius work wonder yesterday let think own do morning put finish touch 
13,“Is this your stall?” said Ethel.,stall say 
14,"“Yes, but it will not bear a comparison with hers. It has a lady’s-maid look by the side of hers.

18,"“Ay, we have been lazy, you see, and so Aunt Leonora brought down all these smart concerns. It is rather like Howell and James’s, isn’t it?”",lazy see bring smart concern 
19,"In fact, Lady Leonora’s marquee was filled with costly knick-knacks, which, as Meta justly said, had not half the grace and appropriate air that reigned where Flora had arranged, and where Margaret had worked, with the peculiar freshness and finish that distinguished everything to which she set her hand.",fact marquee fill costly knick knack say grace appropriate air reign arrange work peculiar freshness finish distinguish set hand 
20,"Miss Cleveland’s counter was not ill set-out, but it wanted the air of ease and simplicity, which was even more noticeable than the perfect taste of Flora’s wares. If there had been nothing facetious, the effect would have been better, but there was nothing to regret, and the whole was very bright and gay.",counter ill set want air ease simplicity noticeable perfect taste ware be facetious effect good be regret whole bright gay

24,"It was the first time of seeing her in the white muslin, and broad chip hat--which all the younger saleswomen of the bazaar had agreed to wear. It was a most becoming dress, and she did, indeed, look strikingly elegant and well dressed. It occurred to Ethel, for the first time, that Flora was decidedly the reigning beauty of the bazaar--no one but Meta Rivers could be compared to her, and that little lady was on so small a scale of perfect finish, that she seemed fit to act the fairy, where Flora was the enchanted princess.",first time see white muslin broad chip hat young saleswomen bazaar agree wear become dress look elegant dress occur first time reign beauty bazaar compare little lady small scale perfect finish seem fit act fairy enchanted princess 
25,"Flora greeted her sisters eagerly, while Meta introduced her brother--a great contrast to herself, though not without a certain comeliness, tall and large, with ruddy complexion, deep lustreless black eyes, and a heavy straight bush of black moustache, veiling rather thick lips. Blanche reiterated inquiries for her watch-guard.",greet sister introduce brother great contrast certain comeliness tall large ruddy complexion deep lustreless black eye heavy straight bush black moustache veil thick lip reiterate inquiry watch guard

29,"So Blanche ran from place to place in restless dismay, that caused Mr. George Rivers to ask what was the matter.",run place place restless dismay cause ask matter 
30,"“The guards! the guards!” cried Blanche; whereupon he fell into a fit of laughter, which disconcerted her, because she could not understand him, and made Ethel take an aversion to him on the spot.",guard guard cry fall fit laughter disconcert understand make take aversion spot 
31,"However, he was very good-natured; he took Blanche’s reluctant hand, and conducted her all along the stall, even proceeding to lift her up where she could not command a view of the whole, thus exciting her extreme indignation. She shook herself out when he set her down, surveyed her crumpled muslin, and believed he took her for a little girl! She ought to have been flattered when the quest was successful, and he insisted on knowing which was the guard, and declared that he should buy it. She begged him to do no such thing, and he desired to know why--insisting that he would give five shillings--fifteen--twenty-five for that one! till she did not know whether he was in earnest, and she doing an injury to the bazaar.",good natured take reluctant hand conduct stall proceed lift command view whole exciting extreme indignation shake set survey crumple muslin believe take little girl flatter quest successful insist know guard declare buy begg do such thing desire know insist give shilling one know earnest do injury bazaar 
32,"Meantime, the hour had struck, and Flora had placed Mrs. Hoxton in a sheltered spot, where she could take as much or as little trouble as she pleased. Lady Leonora and Miss Langdale came from the house, and, with the two ladies’-maids in the background, took up their station with Miss Rivers. Miss Cleveland called her party to order, and sounds of carriages were heard approaching.",hour strike place shelter spot take much little trouble pleased come house lady maid background take station call party order sound carriage hear approach 
33,"Mary and Blanche disbursed the first money spent in the “fancy fair;”  Mary, on a blotting-book for Harry, to be placed among the presents, to which she added on every birthday, while Blanche bought a sixpenny gift for every one, with more attention to the quantity than the quality. Then came a revival of her anxieties for the guards, and while Mary was simply desirous of the fun of being a shopwoman, and was made happy by Meta Rivers asking her help, Blanche was in despair, till she had sidled up to their neighbourhood, and her piteous looks had caused good-natured Mrs. Hoxton to invite her to assist, when she placed herself close to the precious object.",disburs first money spend fancy fair blotting book place present add birthday buy sixpenny gift one more attention quantity quality come revival anxiety guard desirous fun shopwoman make happy ask help despair sidl neighbourhood piteous look cause good natured invite assist place precious object 
34,"A great fluttering of heart went to that manoeuvre, but still felicity could not be complete. That great troublesome Mr. George Rivers had actually threatened to buy nothing but that one watch-chain, and Blanche’s eye followed him everywhere with fear, lest he should come that way. And there were many other gentlemen--what could they want but watch-guards, and of them--what--save this paragon?",great flutter heart go manoeuvre felicity complete great troublesome threaten buy watch chain eye follow fear come way be many other gentleman want watch guard save paragon 
35,"Poor Blanche; what did she not undergo whenever any one cast his eye over her range of goods? and this was not seldom, for there was an attraction in the pretty little eager girl, glowing and smiling. One old gentleman actually stopped, handled the guards themselves, and asked their price.",poor undergo one cast eye range goods seldom be attraction pretty little eager girl glow smile old gentleman stop handle guard ask price

He is turning over the goods with an air, she trying to look equally careless, but what a pretty carnation it is! Ha! ha! he has come to it--he has it! Now the acting is over, and they are having their laugh out! How joyously! What next!

45,"The great event of the day was over now with Blanche, and she greatly enjoyed wandering about with Hector and Tom. There was a post-office at Miss Cleveland’s stall, where, on paying sixpence, a letter could be obtained to the address of the inquirer. Blanche had been very anxious to try, but Flora had pronounced it nonsense; however, Hector declared that Flora was not his master, tapped at the sliding panel, and charmed Blanche by what she thought a most witty parody of his name as Achilles Lionsrock, Esquire. When the answer came from within, “Ship letter, sir, double postage,” they thought it almost uncanny; and Hector’s shilling was requited by something so like a real ship letter, that they had some idea that the real post had somehow transported itself thither. The interior was decidedly oracular, consisting of this one line, “I counsel you to persevere in your laudable undertaking.”",great event day enjoy wonder be post office stall pay letter obtain address inquirer anxious try pronounce nonsense declare master tap slide panel charm think witty parody name answer come ship letter sir double postage think uncanny shilling requit real ship letter have idea real post transport interior oracular consist line counsel persevere laudable undertaking 
46,"Hector said he wished he had any laudable undertaking, and Blanche tried to persuade Tom to try his fortune, but he pronounced that he did not care to hear Harvey Anderson’s trash--he knew his writing, though disguised, and had detected his shining boots below the counter. There Mr. George Rivers came up, and began to tease Blanche about the guards, asking her to take his fifteen shillings--or five-and-twenty, and who had got that one, which alone he wanted; till the poor child, after standing perplexed for some moments, looked up with spirit, and said, “You have no business to ask,” and, running away, took refuge in the back of Mrs. Hoxton’s marquee, where she found Ethel packing up for Miss Hoxton’s purchasers, and confiding to her that Mr. George Rivers was a horrid man, she ventured no more from her protection. She did, indeed, emerge, when told that papa was coming with Aubrey and Daisy and Miss Bracy, and she had the pleasure of selling to them some of her wares. Dr. May bargaining with her to her infinite satisfaction; and little Gertrude’s blue eyes opened to their full width, not understanding what could have befallen her sisters.",say wish have laudable undertaking try persuade try fortune pronounce care hear trash know writing disguise detect shine boot counter come begin tease guard ask take shilling get one alone want poor child stand perplex moment look spirit say have business ask run take refuge back marquee find pack purchaser confide horrid man venture protection emerge tell come have pleasure sell ware bargain infinite satisfaction little blue eye open full width understand befall sister

51,"For Ethel was noted as the worst packer in the house; but, having offered to wrap up a pincushion, sold by a hurried Miss Hoxton, she became involved in the office for the rest of the day--the same which Bellairs and her companion performed at the Langdale counter. Flora was too ready and dexterous to need any such aid, but the Misses Hoxton were glad to be spared the trouble; and Blanche, whose fingers were far neater than Ethel’s, made the task much easier, and was kept constant to it by her dread of the dark moustache, which was often visible near their tent, searching, she thought, for her.",note bad packer house offer wrap pincushion sell hurry become involve office rest day same companion perform counter ready dexterous need such aid glad spare trouble finger neater make task easy keep constant dread dark moustache visible tent search think 
52,"Their humble employment was no sinecure; for this was the favourite stall with the purchasers of better style, since the articles were, in general, tasteful, and fairly worth the moderate price set on them. At Miss Cleveland’s counter there was much noisy laughter--many jocular cheats--tricks for gaining money, and refusals to give change; and it seemed to be very popular with the Stoneborough people, and to carry on a brisk trade. The only languor was in Lady Leonora’s quarter--the articles were too costly, and hung on hand; nor were the ladies sufficiently well known, nor active enough, to gain custom, excepting Meta, who drove a gay traffic at her end of the stall, which somewhat redeemed the general languor.",humble employment sinecure favourite stall purchaser good style article general tasteful worth moderate price set counter be much noisy laughter many jocular cheat trick gain money refusal give change seem popular person carry brisk trade only languor quarter article costly hang hand lady know active gain custom except drive gay traffic end stall redeem general languor 
53,"Her eyes were, all the time, watching for her father, and, suddenly perceiving him, she left her trade in charge of the delighted and important Mary, and hastened to walk round with him, and show him the humours of the fair.",eye time watch father perceive leave trade charge delighted important hasten walk show humour fair 
54,"Mary, in her absence, had the supreme happiness of obtaining Norman as a customer. He wanted a picture for his rooms at Oxford, and water-coloured drawings were, as Tom had observed, suitable staple commodities for Miss Rivers. Mary tried to make him choose a brightly-coloured pheasant, with a pencil background; and, then, a fine foaming sea-piece, by some unknown Lady Adelaide, that much dazzled her imagination; but nothing would serve him but a sketch of an old cedar tree, with Stoneborough Minster in the distance, and the Welsh hills beyond, which Mary thought a remarkable piece of bad taste, since--could he not see all that any day of his life? and was it worth while to give fourteen shillings and sixpence for it? But he said it was all for the good of Cocksmoor, and Mary was only too glad to add to her hoard of coin; so she only marvelled at his extravagance, and offered to take care of it for him; but, to this, he would not consent. He made her pack it up for him, and had just put the whitey-brown parcel under his arm, when Mr. Rivers and his daughter came up, before he was aware. Mary proudly advertised Meta that she had sold something for her.",absence have supreme happiness obtain customer want picture room water coloured drawing observe suitable staple commodity try make choose coloured pheasant pencil background fine foaming sea piece unknown dazzle imagination serve sketch old cedar tree distance welsh hill think remarkable piece bad taste see day life worth while give shilling say good glad add hoard coin marvel extravagance offer take care consent make pack put whitey brown parcel arm daughter come aware advertise sell

58,"“Oh, papa, I can do another. But, I wonder! I put that extortionate price on it, thinking no one would give it, and so that I should keep it for you. Who has it, Mary?”",do wonder put extortionate price think give keep have 
59,"“Norman, there. He would have it, though I told him it was very dear.”",have tell dear 
60,"Norman, pressed near them by the crowd, had been unable to escape, and stood blushing, hesitating, and doubting whether he ought to restore the prize, which he had watched so long, and obtained so eagerly.",press crowd unable escape stand blush hesitate doub restore prize watch obtain 
61,"“Oh! it is you?” said Mr. Rivers politely. “Oh, no, do not think of exchanging it. I am rejoiced that one should have it who can appreciate it. It was its falling into the hands of a stranger that I disliked. You think with me, that it is one of her best drawings?”",say think exchang rejoice have appreciate falling hand stranger dislike think good drawing 
62,"“Yes, I do,” said Norman, still rather hesitating. “She did that with C--, when he was here last year. He taught her very well. Have you that other here, that you took with him, my dear? The view from the gate, I mean.”",say hesitate do last year teach other take dear view gate mean 
63,"“No, dear papa. You told me not to sell that.”",dear papa tell sell 
64,“Ah! I remember; that is right. But there are some very pretty copies from Prout here.”,remember right be pretty copy 
65,"While he was seeking them, Meta contrived to whisper, “If you could persuade him to go indoors--this confusion of people is so bad for him, and I must not come away. I was in hopes of Dr. May, but he is with the little ones.”",seek contrive whisper persuade go confusion person bad come hope little one 
66,"Norman signed comprehension, and Meta said, “Those copies are not worth seeing, but you know, papa, you have the originals in the library.”",sign comprehension say copy worth see know papa have original library 
67,"Mr. Rivers looked pleased, but was certain that Norman could not prefer the sketches to this gay scene. However, it took very little persuasion to induce him to do what he wished, and he took Norman’s arm, crossed the lawn, and arrived in his own study, where it was a great treat to him to catch any one who would admire his accumulation of prints, drawings, coins, etc.; and his young friend was both very well amused and pleased to be setting Miss Rivers’s mind at ease on her father’s account. It was not till half-past four that Dr. May knocked at the door, and stood surprised at finding his son there. Mr. Rivers spoke warmly of the young Oxonian’s kindness in leaving the fair for an old man, and praised Norman’s taste in art. Norman rose to take leave, but still thought it incumbent on him to offer to give up the picture, if Mr. Rivers set an especial value on it. But Mr. Rivers went to the length of being very glad that it was in his possession, and added to it a very pretty drawing of the same size, by a noted master, which had been in the water-colour exhibition, and, while Norman walked away, well pleased, Mr. Rivers began to extol him to his father, as a very superior and sensible young man, of great promise, and began to wish George had the same turn.",look pleased certain prefer sketche gay scene take little persuasion induce do wish take arm cross lawn arrive own study great treat catch one admire accumulation print drawing coin etc. young friend amused pleased set mind ease father account half past knock door stand surprise find son speak young kindness leave fair old man praise taste art rise take leave think incumbent offer give picture set especial value go length glad possession add pretty draw same size note master water colour exhibition walk pleased begin extol father superior sensible young man great promise begin wish have same turn 
68,"Norman, on returning to the fancy fair, found the world in all the ardour of raffles. Lady Leonora’s contributions were the chief prizes, which attracted every one, and, of course, the result was delightfully incongruous. Poor Ethel, who had been persuaded to venture a shilling to please Blanche, who had spent all her own, obtained the two jars in potichomanie, and was regarding them with a face worth painting. Harvey Anderson had a doll, George Rivers a wooden monkey, that jumped over a stick; and, if Hector Ernescliffe was enchanted at winning a beautiful mother-of-pearl inlaid workbox, which he had vainly wished to buy for Margaret, Flora only gained a match-box of her own, well known always to miss fire, but which had been decided to be good enough for the bazaar.",return fancy fair find world ardour raffle contribution chief prize attract one course result incongruous poor persuade venture shilling please spend own obtain jar regard face worth painting have doll wooden monkey jump stick enchant win beautiful mother pearl inlaid workbox wish buy gain match box own know miss fire decide good bazaar 
69,"By fair means or foul, the commodities were cleared off, and, while the sunbeams faded from the trodden grass, the crowds disappeared, and the vague compliment, “a very good bazaar,” was exchanged between the lingering sellers and their friends.",fair means foul commodity clear sunbeam fade trodd grass crowd disappear vague compliment good bazaar exchange linger seller friend 
70,"Flora was again to sleep at the Grange, and return the next day, for a committee to be held over the gains, which were not yet fully ascertained. So Dr. May gathered his flock together, and packed them, boys and all, into the two conveyances, and Ethel bade Meta good-night, almost wondering to hear her merry voice say, “It has been a delightful day, has it not? It was so kind of your brother to take care of papa.”",sleep return next day committee hold gain ascertain gather flock pack boy conveyance bid good night wonder hear merry voice say delightful day kind brother take care papa

73,"Ethel smiled, but hurried her departure, for she saw Blanche again tormented by Mr. George Rivers, to know what had become of the guard, telling her that, if she would not say, he should be furiously jealous.",smile hurry departure see torment know become guard tell say jealous 
74,"Blanche hid her face on Ethel’s arm, when they were in the carriage, and almost cried with indignant “shamefastness.” That long-desired day had not been one of unmixed happiness to her, poor child, and Ethel doubted whether it had been so to any one, except, indeed, to Mary, whose desires never soared so high but that they were easily fulfilled, and whose placid content was not easily wounded. All she was wishing now was, that Harry were at home to receive his paper-case.",hide face arm carriage cry indignant shamefastness long desire day unmixed happiness poor child doubt one desire soar high fulfil placid content wound wish home receive paper case 
75,"The return to Margaret was real pleasure. The narration of all that had passed was an event to her. She was so charmed with her presents, of every degree; things, unpleasant at the time, could, by drollery in the relating, be made mirthful fun ever after; Dr. May and the boys were so comical in their observations--Mary’s wonder and simplicity came in so amazingly--and there was such merriment at Ethel’s two precious jars, that she could hardly wish they had not come to her. On one head they were all agreed, in dislike of George Rivers, whom Mary pronounced to be a detestable man, and, when gently called to order by Margaret, defended it, by saying that Miss Bracy said it was better to detest than to hate, while Blanche coloured up to the ears, and hid herself behind the arm-chair; and Dr. May qualified the censure by saying, he believed there was no great harm in the youth, but that he was shallow-brained and extravagant, and, having been born in the days when Mr. Rivers had been working himself up in the world, had not had so good an education as his little half-sister.",return real pleasure narration pass event charm present degree thing unpleasant time drollery relate make mirthful fun boy comical observation wonder simplicity come be such merriment precious jar wish come head agree dislike pronounce detestable man call order defend say say good detest hate coloured ear hide arm chair qualify censure say believe be great harm youth shallow brained extravagant bear day work world have good education little half sister

81,"“So I have been telling myself, papa, all along; but, now that the day has come, and I have seen what jealousies, and competitions, and vanities, and disappointments it has produced--not even poor little Blanche allowed any comfort--I am almost sick at heart with thinking Cocksmoor was the excuse!”",tell papa day come see jealousy competition vanity disappointment produce poor little allow comfort sick heart think excuse

Why is it worth while to go and search for a day’s pleasuring?”",do say smile mean real gladness life great occasion pleasure little side delight come midst work papa worth while go search day pleasuring 
84,"“Ethel, my child! I don’t like to hear you talk so,” said Dr. May, looking anxiously at her. “It may be too true, but it is not youthful nor hopeful. It is not as your mother or I felt in our young days, when a treat was a treat to us, and gladdened our hearts long before and after. I am afraid you have been too much saddened with loss and care--”",child like hear talk say look true youthful hopeful mother feel young day treat treat gladden heart afraid sadden loss care

86,"And Ethel, though she had tried to be cheerful, leaned against his arm, and shed a few tears.",try cheerful learn arm shed few tear 
87,"“The fact is, she is tired out,” said Dr. May soothingly, yet half laughing. “She is not a beauty or a grace, and she is thoughtful and quiet, and so she moralises, instead of enjoying, as the world goes by. I dare say a night’s rest will make all the difference in the world.”",fact tired say half laugh beauty grace thoughtful quiet moralise enjoy world go say night rest make difference world
