3,"It was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the cave where they all lived. “Augrh!” said Father Wolf. “It is time to hunt again.” He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go with you, O Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble children that they may never forget the hungry in this world.”",o'clock warm evening hill wake day rest scratch yawn spread paw other get rid sleepy feeling tip lay big gray nose drop tumble squeal cub moon shine mouth cave live say time hunt go spring hill little shadow bushy tail cross threshold whine good luck go good luck strong white tooth go noble child forget hungry world 
4,"It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the madness--and run.",jackal dish licker wolf despise run make mischief tell tale eat rag piece leather village rubbish heap afraid more else jungle apt go mad forget afraid run forest bite way tiger run hide little go mad madness disgraceful thing overtake wild creature call hydrophobia call dewanee madness run

6,"“For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but for so mean a person as myself a dry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people], to pick and choose?” He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he found the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end merrily.",wolf say mean person dry bone good feast log jackal person pick choose scuttle back cave find bone buck meat sit crack end

Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings are men from the beginning.”",thanks good meal say lick lip beautiful noble child large eye young remember child king man beginning

He will frighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for two, these days.”",have right begin have right change quarter due warning frighten head game mile have kill day 
13,"“His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,” said Mother Wolf quietly. “He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That is why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are angry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry. They will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our children must run when the grass is set alight.

21,"“Man!” said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!”",man say show white tooth be enough beetle frog tank eat ground 
22,"The Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason, forbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his children how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds of his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing means, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with guns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches. Then everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among themselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living things, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is true--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.",order reason forbid beast eat kill show child kill hunt hunting grounds pack tribe real reason man-killing mean arrival white man elephant gun hundred brown man gong rocket torche jungle suffer reason beast give weak defenseless living thing unsportsmanlike touch say true man-eater become mangy lose tooth

28,"The bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped with his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been watching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the wolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was he was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was that he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing almost where he left ground.",bush rustle little thicket drop haunch ready leap watch see wonderful thing world wolf check mid-spring make bind see jump try stop result shoot air foot land leave ground

He looked up into Father Wolf’s face, and laughed.",front hold low branch stand naked brown baby walk soft dimple little atom come wolf cave night look face laugh

33,"“How little! How naked, and--how bold!” said Mother Wolf softly. The baby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide. “Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man’s cub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man’s cub among her children?”",little naked bold say baby push way cub get close warm hide take meal other man cub be wolf boast man cub child

35,"The moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan’s great square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui, behind him, was squeaking: “My lord, my lord, it went in here!”",moonlight block mouth cave great square head shoulder thrust entrance squeak lord lord go

38,"Shere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter’s campfire, as Father Wolf had said, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf knew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in by. Even where he was, Shere Khan’s shoulders and forepaws were cramped for want of room, as a man’s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.",jump woodcutter campfire say furious pain burn foot know mouth cave narrow tiger come shoulder forepaw cramped want room man try fight barrel

41,"The tiger’s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself clear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in the darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.",tiger roar fill cave thunder shake clear cub spring eye green moon darkness face blaze eye 
42,"“And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man’s cub is mine, Lungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with the Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of little naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee!

43,"Father Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he won Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in the Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment’s sake. Shere Khan might have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother Wolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the ground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth growling, and when he was clear he shouted:",look amazed forget day win fair fight other wolf run call compliment sake face stand know have advantage ground fight death back cave mouth growling clear shout

47,"“Keep him!” she gasped. “He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry; yet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side already. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run off to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our lairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him.

48,“But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf.,pack say say 
49,"The Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he marries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs are old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack Council, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order that the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs are free to run where they please, and until they have killed their first buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one of them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if you think for a minute you will see that this must be so.",lay wolf marry withdraw belong cub old stand foot bring hold month full moon order other wolf identify inspection cub free run kill first buck excuse accept grow wolf kill punishment death murderer find think minute see 
50,"Father Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the night of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the Council Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred wolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack by strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and below him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from badger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black three-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a year now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he had been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs of men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over each other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers sat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look at him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a mother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that he had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: “Ye know the Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And the anxious mothers would take up the call: “Look--look well, O Wolves!”",wait cub run little night take hilltop cover stone boulder wolf hide great gray lead strength cunning lay full length rock sit more wolf size color badger color veteran handle buck young black year old think lone lead year fall wolf trap youth beat leave dead know manners custom man be little talking rock cub tumble other center circle mother father sit senior wolf go cub look return place noiseless foot mother push cub moonlight sure overlook rock cry know know look o wolf anxious mother take call look look wolf

52,"Akela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the monotonous cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came up from behind the rocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: “The cub is mine. Give him to me. What have the Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Akela never even twitched his ears. All he said was: “Look well, O Wolves! What have the Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look well!”",raise head paw go monotonous cry look muffled roar come rock voice cry cub give free do man cub twitch ear say look wolf free do order save free look 
53,"There was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year flung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there is any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he must be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his father and mother.",be chorus deep growl young wolf fourth year flung question free do man cub lay be dispute right cub accept speak least member father mother

55,"Then the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo, the sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle: old Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only nuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.",only other creature allow sleepy brown bear teach wolf cub old come go please eat nut root honey rise hind quarter grunt

58,"A black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black Panther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew Bagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as Tabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded elephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree, and a skin softer than down.",black shadow drop circle black inky black panther marking show certain light pattern water silk know care cross path cunning bold wild buffalo reckless wound elephant have voice soft wild honey drip tree skin softer 
59,"“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your assembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which is not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may be bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay that price. Am I right?”",free purr have right assembly say be doubt killing matter regard new cub life cub buy price say pay price right

Is it difficult?”",kill naked cub shame make good sport grow speak behalf word add bull fat one kill mile accept man cub accord difficult

Where is the bull, Bagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying: “Look well--look well, O Wolves!”",be clamor score voice say matter die winter rain scorch sun harm naked frog do let run bull let accept come deep bay cry look look wolf 
65,"Mowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice when the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went down the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and Mowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for he was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.",interested pebble notice wolf come look last go hill dead bull own wolf leave roar night angry hand

72,"Now you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He grew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, “Come along, Little Brother,” and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too, when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop gate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it, and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull’s life. “All the jungle is thine,” said Bagheera, “and thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of the Jungle.” Mowgli obeyed faithfully.",content skip whole year guess wonderful life lead wolf write fill many book grow cub course grow wolf child teach business meaning thing jungle rustle grass breath warm night air note owl head scratch bat claw roost while tree splash little fish jump pool mean much work office mean business man learn sit sun sleep eat go sleep feel dirty hot swim forest pool want honey tell honey nut pleasant eat raw meat climb show do lie branch call come little first cling sloth fling branch gray ape take place meet discover stare wolf wolf force drop eye use stare fun other time pick long thorn pad friend wolf suffer thorn bur coat go hillside cultivate land night look villager hut have mistrust man show square box drop gate hide jungle walk tell trap love good else go dark warm heart forest sleep drowsy day night see do killing kill leave feel hungry do exception old understand thing tell touch cattle buy pack price bull life jungle say kill art strong kill sake bull buy kill eat cattle young old obey

74,"Mother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature to be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan.

75,"Shere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew older and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the younger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela would never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the proper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such fine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man’s cub. “They tell me,” Shere Khan would say, “that at Council ye dare not look him between the eyes.” And the young wolves would growl and bristle.",cross path jungle grow old feebler lame tiger come great friend young wolf follow scrap thing allow dare push authority proper bound flatter wonder such fine young hunter content lead die wolf man cub tell say look eye young wolf grow bristle 
76,"Bagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and once or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill him some day.

Why should I be afraid?”",have eye ear know tell many word kill day laugh answer have have lazy strike blow sake afraid

Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But remember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill his buck, and then he will be leader no more.

It was because of this that I paid the price for thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too was born among men. I had never seen the jungle.

Because I was all but your brother in blood, I promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as ye have betrayed me.” He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks flew up. “There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here is a debt to pay before I go.” He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat blinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.
