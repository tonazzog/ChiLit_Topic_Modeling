2,"When Ready returned on board, he first went down into the cabin to acquaint Mrs Seagrave and William with what they had done.  Mrs Seagrave naturally felt anxious about her husband being on shore alone, and Ready informed her that they had agreed that if anything should occur Mr Seagrave would fire the musket.  He then went down into the sail-room to get some canvas, a new topgallant sail which was there, and a palm and needles with twine.  Scarcely had he got them out, and at the foot of the ladder, when the report of the musket was heard, and Mrs Seagrave rushed out of the cabin in the greatest alarm; Ready seized another musket, jumped into the boat, and pulled on shore as fast as he could.  On his arrival, quite out of breath, for as he pulled on shore he had his back towards it, and could see nothing, he found Mr Seagrave and Juno busy with the tent, and Tommy sitting on the ground crying very lustily.  It appeared that, while Mr Seagrave and Juno were employed, Tommy had crept away to where the musket was placed up on end against a cocoa-nut tree, and, after pulling it about some little while, had touched the trigger.  The musket went off; and, as the muzzle was pointed upwards, the charge had brought down two large cocoa-nuts.  Mr Seagrave, who was aware what an alarm this would produce on board the vessel, had been scolding him soundly, and now Master Tommy was crying, to prove how very penitent he was.",ready return board go cabin acquaint do feel anxious husband shore ready inform agree occur fire musket go sail room get canvas new topgallant sail palm needle twine get foot ladder report musket hear rush cabin great alarm ready seize musket jump boat pull shore arrival breath pull shore have back see find busy tent sit ground cry appear employ creep musket place end cocoa nut tree pull little while touch trigger musket go muzzle point charge bring large cocoa- nut aware alarm produce board vessel scold cry prove penitent

6,"Having put into the boat the sailmaker's bag, with palm and needles, two mattresses, and blankets from the captain's state room, the saucepan with the beef and pork, and a spar which he towed astern, Ready found that he had as much as he could carry; but, as there was nobody but himself in it, he came on shore very well.  Having, with the assistance of Mr Seagrave and Juno, got all the things up to the knoll, Ready lashed the spar up for the second tent, and then leaving them to fix it up like the other, he returned again on board.  He made two other trips to the ship, bringing with him more bedding, a bag of ship's biscuits, another of potatoes, plates, knives and forks, spoons, frying-pans and other cooking utensils, and a variety of other articles.  He then showed Juno how to fill up the ends of the first tent with the canvas and sails he had brought on shore, so as to inclose it all round; Juno took the needle and twine, and worked very well.  Ready, satisfied that she would be able to get on without them, now said: ""Mr Seagrave, we have but two hours more daylight, and it is right that Mrs Seagrave should come on shore now; so, if you please, we'll go off and fetch her and the children.  I think we shall be able to do very well for the first night; and if it pleases God to give us fine weather, we may do a great deal more to-morrow.""",put boat sailmaker bag palm needle mattress blanket captain state room saucepan beef pork spar tow ready find have much carry be come shore assistance get thing knoll ready lash spar second tent leave fix other return board make other trip ship bring more bedding bag ship biscuit potato plate knife fork spoon frying pan other cooking utensil variety other article show fill end first tent canvas sail bring shore inclose take needle twine work ready satisfied able get say have hour more daylight right come shore go fetch child think able do first night please give fine weather do great deal more 
7,"As soon as they arrived on board, Mr Seagrave went down to his wife to propose her going on shore.  She was much agitated, and very weak from her illness, but she behaved courageously notwithstanding, and, supported by her husband, gained the deck, William following with the baby, and his little sister Caroline carried by Ready.  With some difficulty they were all at last placed in the boat and shoved off; but Mrs Seagrave was so ill, that her husband was obliged to support her in his arms, and William took an oar.  They landed very safely, and carried Mrs Seagrave up to the tent, and laid her down on one of the mattresses.  She asked for a little water.",arrive board go wife propose go shore agitated weak illness behave notwithstand support husband gain deck follow baby little sister carry ready difficulty last place boat shove ill husband oblige support arm take oar land carry tent lay mattress ask little water 
8,"""And I have forgotten to bring any with me: well, I am a stupid old man; but I'll go on board directly,"" said Ready: ""to think that I should be so busy in bringing other things on shore and forget the greatest necessary in life!  The fact is, I intended to look for it on the island as soon as I could, as it would save a great deal of trouble.""",forget bring stupid old man go board say ready think busy bring other thing shore forget great necessary life fact intend look island save great deal trouble

17,"""I shall be better soon, sir; I'll just lie down a little, and then I'll have a biscuit and a little meat.""",good sir lie little have biscuit little meat 
18,"Poor old Ready was indeed quite tired out; but he ate something, and felt much revived.  Juno was very busy; she had given the children some of the salt meat and biscuit to eat.  The baby, and Tommy, and Caroline had been put to bed, and the second tent was nearly ready.",poor old ready tired eat feel revive busy give child salt meat biscuit eat baby put bed second tent ready
