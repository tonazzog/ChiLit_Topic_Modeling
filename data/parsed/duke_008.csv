1,CHAPTER VIII.,
2," It was a fine summer evening, and Richard and Carloman were playing at ball on the steps of the Castle-gate, when a voice was heard from beneath, begging for alms from the noble Princes in the name of the blessed Virgin, and the two boys saw a pilgrim standing at the gate, wrapt in a long robe of serge, with a staff in his hand, surmounted by a Cross, a scrip at his girdle, and a broad shady hat, which he had taken off, as he stood, making low obeisances, and asking charity.",fine summer evening play ball step gate voice hear begg alm noble name bless boy see pilgrim stand gate wrapt long robe serge staff hand surmount scrip girdle broad shady hat take stand make low obeisance ask charity

4,"""Blessings from Heaven light on you, noble Prince,"" replied the pilgrim, and at that moment Richard shouted joyfully, ""A Norman, a Norman! 'tis my own dear speech!  Oh, are you not from Normandy?  Osmond, Osmond! he comes from home!""",blessing heaven light noble reply pilgrim moment shout own dear speech come home

6,"""Walter!--Walter, the huntsman!"" cried Richard.  ""Is it you?  Oh, how is Fru Astrida, and all at home?""",huntsman cry home 
7,"""Well, my Lord, and wearying to know how it is with you--"" began Walter--but a very different tone exclaimed from behind the pilgrim, ""What is all this?  Who is stopping my way?  What!  Richard would be King, and more, would he?  More insolence!""  It was Lothaire, returning with his attendants from the chase, in by no means an amiable mood, for he had been disappointed of his game.",weary know begin different tone exclaim pilgrim stop way more insolence return attendant chase means amiable mood disappoint game

12,"""No Norman is scourged in my sight!"" said Richard, darting forwards, and throwing himself between Walter and the woodsman, who was preparing to obey Lothaire, just in time to receive on his own bare neck the sharp, cutting leathern thong, which raised a long red streak along its course. Lothaire laughed.",scourge sight say dart forward throw woodsman prepare obey time receive own bare neck sharp cut leathern thong raise long red streak course laugh 
13,"""My Lord Duke!  What have you done?  Oh, leave me--this befits you not!"" cried Walter, extremely distressed; but Richard had caught hold of the whip, and called out, ""Away, away! run! haste, haste!"" and the words were repeated at once by Osmond, Carloman, and many of the French, who, though afraid to disobey the Prince, were unwilling to violate the sanctity of a pilgrim's person; and the Norman, seeing there was no help for it, obeyed: the French made way for him and he effected his escape; while Lothaire, after a great deal of storming and raging, went up to his mother to triumph in the cleverness with which he had detected a Norman spy in disguise.",do leave befit cry distressed catch hold whip call run haste haste word repeat many afraid disobey unwilling violate sanctity pilgrim person see be help obey make way effect escape great deal storm rage go mother triumph cleverness detect spy disguise 
14,"Lothaire was not far wrong; Walter had really come to satisfy himself as to the safety of the little Duke, and try to gain an interview with Osmond.  In the latter purpose he failed, though he lingered in the neighbourhood of Laon for several days; for Osmond never left the Duke for an instant, and he was, as has been shown, a close prisoner, in all but the name, within the walls of the Castle.  The pilgrim had, however, the opportunity of picking up tidings which made him perceive the true state of things: he learnt the deaths of Sybald and Henry, the alliance between the King and Arnulf, and the restraint and harshness with which the Duke was treated; and with this intelligence he went in haste to Normandy.",wrong come satisfy safety little try gain interview latter purpose fail linger neighbourhood several day leave instant show close prisoner name wall pilgrim opportunity pick tiding make perceive true state thing learn death alliance restraint harshness treat intelligence go haste 
15,"Soon after his arrival, a three days' fast was observed throughout the dukedom, and in every church, from the Cathedral of Bayeux to the smallest and rudest village shrine, crowds of worshippers were kneeling, imploring, many of them with tears, that God would look on them in His mercy, restore to them their Prince, and deliver the child out of the hands of his enemies.  How earnest and sorrowful were the prayers offered at Centeville may well be imagined; and at Montemar sur Epte the anxiety was scarcely less.  Indeed, from the time the evil tidings arrived, Alberic grew so restless and unhappy, and so anxious to do something, that at last his mother set out with him on a pilgrimage to the Abbey of Jumieges, to pray for the rescue of his dear little Duke.",arrival day fast observe dukedom church small rude village shrine crowd worshipper kneel implor many tear look mercy restore deliver child hand enemy earnest sorrowful prayer offer imagine anxiety less time evil tiding arrive grow restless unhappy anxious do last mother set pilgrimage pray rescue dear little 
16,"In the meantime, Louis had sent notice to Laon that he should return home in a week's time; and Richard rejoiced at the prospect, for the King had always been less unkind to him than the Queen, and he hoped to be released from his captivity within the Castle.  Just at this time he became very unwell; it might have been only the effect of the life of unwonted confinement which he had lately led that was beginning to tell on his health; but, after being heavy and uncomfortable for a day or two, without knowing what was the matter with him, he was one night attacked with high fever.",meantime send notice return week time rejoice prospect unkind hope release captivity time become unwell effect life unwonted confinement lead begin tell health heavy uncomfortable day know matter night attack high fever 
17,"Osmond was dreadfully alarmed, knowing nothing at all of the treatment of illness, and, what was worse, fully persuaded that the poor child had been poisoned, and therefore resolved not to call any assistance; he hung over him all night, expecting each moment to see him expire--ready to tear his hair with despair and fury, and yet obliged to restrain himself to the utmost quietness and gentleness, to soothe the suffering of the sick child.",alarm know treatment illness bad persuade poor child poison resolve call assistance hang night expect moment see expire ready tear hair despair fury oblige restrain utmost quietness gentleness soothe suffering sick child 
18,"Through that night, Richard either tossed about on his narrow bed, or, when his restlessness desired the change, sat, leaning his aching head on Osmond's breast, too oppressed and miserable to speak or think.  When the day dawned on them, and he was still too ill to leave the room, messengers were sent for him, and Osmond could no longer conceal the fact of his sickness, but parleyed at the door, keeping out every one he could, and refusing all offers of attendance.  He would not even admit Carloman, though Richard, hearing his voice, begged to see him; and when a proposal was sent from the Queen, that a skilful old nurse should visit and prescribe for the patient, he refused with all his might, and when he had shut the door, walked up and down, muttering, ""Ay, ay, the witch! coming to finish what she has begun!""",night toss narrow bed restlessness desire change sit lean ach head breast oppress miserable speak think day dawn ill leave room messenger send conceal fact sickness parley door keep one refuse offer attendance admit hear voice begg see proposal send skilful old nurse visit prescribe patient refuse shut door walk mutter witch come finish begin 
19,"All that day and the next, Richard continued very ill, and Osmond waited on him very assiduously, never closing his eyes for a moment, but constantly telling his beads whenever the boy did not require his attendance.  At last Richard fell asleep, slept long and soundly for some hours, and waked much better.  Osmond was in a transport of joy: ""Thanks to Heaven, they shall fail for this time and they shall never have another chance!  May Heaven be with us still!""  Richard was too weak and weary to ask what he meant, and for the next few days Osmond watched him with the utmost care.  As for food, now that Richard could eat again, Osmond would not hear of his touching what was sent for him from the royal table, but always went down himself to procure food in the kitchen, where he said he had a friend among the cooks, who would, he thought, scarcely poison him intentionally.  When Richard was able to cross the room, he insisted on his always fastening the door with his dagger, and never opening to any summons but his own, not even Prince Carloman's. Richard wondered, but he was obliged to obey; and he knew enough of the perils around him to perceive the reasonableness of Osmond's caution.",day next continue ill wait close eye moment tell bead boy require attendance last fall asleep sleep hour wake good transport joy thanks fail time have chance heaven weak weary ask mean next few day watch utmost care food eat hear touch send royal table go procure food kitchen say have friend cook think poison able cross room insist fasten door dagger open summons own wonder oblige obey know enough peril perceive reasonableness caution 
20,"Thus several days had passed, the King had returned, and Richard was so much recovered, that he had become very anxious to be allowed to go down stairs again, instead of remaining shut up there; but still Osmond would not consent, though Richard had done nothing all day but walk round the room, to show how strong he was.",several day pass return recover become anxious allow go stair remain shut consent do day walk room show strong 
21,"""Now, my Lord, guard the door--take care,"" said Osmond; ""you have no loss to-day, for the King has brought home Herluin of Montreuil, whom you would be almost as loth to meet as the Fleming.  And tell your beads while I am gone, that the Saints may bring us out of our peril.""",guard door take care say have loss day bring home loth meet tell bead gone bring peril 
22,"Osmond was absent nearly half an hour, and, when he returned, brought on his shoulders a huge bundle of straw.  ""What is this for?"" exclaimed Richard.  ""I wanted my supper, and you have brought straw!""",absent hour return bring shoulder huge bundle straw exclaim want supper bring straw 
23,"""Here is your supper,"" said Osmond, throwing down the straw, and producing a bag with some bread and meat.  ""What should you say, my Lord, if we should sup in Normandy to-morrow night?""",supper say throw straw produce bag bread meat say sup night 
24,"""In Normandy!"" cried Richard, springing up and clapping his hands.  ""In Normandy!  Oh, Osmond, did you say in Normandy?  Shall we, shall we really?  Oh, joy! joy!  Is Count Bernard come?  Will the King let us go?""",cry spring clap hand say joy count come let go

29,"""That must not be,"" said Osmond; ""we should not have time to escape, if they did not still believe you very ill in bed.""",say have time escape believe ill bed

31,"Richard could hardly eat for excitement, while Osmond hastily made his arrangements, girding on his sword, and giving Richard his dagger to put into his belt.  He placed the remainder of the provisions in his wallet, threw a thick purple cloth mantle over the Duke, and then desired him to lie down on the straw which he had brought in.  ""I shall hide you in it,"" he said, ""and carry you through the hall, as if I was going to feed my horse.""",eat excitement make arrangement gird sword give dagger put belt place remainder provision wallet throw thick purple cloth mantle desire lie straw bring hide say carry hall go feed horse 
32,"""Oh, they will never guess!"" cried Richard, laughing.  ""I will be quite still--I will make no noise--I will hold my breath.""",guess cry laugh make noise hold breath 
33,"""Yes, mind you do not move hand or foot, or rustle the straw.  It is no play--it is life or death,"" said Osmond, as he disposed the straw round the little boy.  ""There, can you breathe?""",mind move hand foot rustle straw play life death say dispose straw little boy breathe 
34,"""Yes,"" said Richard's voice from the midst.  ""Am I quite hidden?""",say voice midst hidden 
35,"""Entirely.  Now, remember, whatever happens, do not move.  May Heaven protect us!  Now, the Saints be with us!""",remember happen move heaven protect 
36,"Richard, from the interior of the bundle heard Osmond set open the door; then he felt himself raised from the ground; Osmond was carrying him along down the stairs, the ends of the straw crushing and sweeping against the wall.  The only way to the outer door was through the hall, and here was the danger.  Richard heard voices, steps, loud singing and laughter, as if feasting was going on; then some one said, ""Tending your horse, Sieur de Centeville?""",interior bundle hear set open door feel raise ground carry stair end straw crush sweep wall only way outer door hall danger hear voice step loud singing laughter feast go one say tend horse

39,"""He is better, my Lord, I thank you, but hardly yet out of danger.""",good thank danger 
40,"""Oh, I wish he was well!  And when will you let me come to him, Osmond? Indeed, I would sit quiet, and not disturb him.""",wish well let come sit quiet disturb

42,"""Did he?  Oh, tell him I love him very much--better than any one here--and it is very dull without him.  Tell him so, Osmond.""",tell love good one dull tell 
43,"Richard could hardly help calling out to his dear little Carloman; but he remembered the peril of Osmond's eyes and the Queen's threat, and held his peace, with some vague notion that some day he would make Carloman King of France.  In the meantime, half stifled with the straw, he felt himself carried on, down the steps, across the court; and then he knew, from the darkness and the changed sound of Osmond's tread, that they were in the stable.  Osmond laid him carefully down, and whispered--""All right so far.  You can breathe?""",help call dear little remember peril eye threat hold peace vague notion day make meantime half stifle straw feel carry step court know darkness change sound tread stable lay whisper breathe 
44,"""Not well.  Can't you let me out?""",let 
45,"""Not yet--not for worlds.  Now tell me if I put you face downwards, for I cannot see.""",world tell put face see 
46,"He laid the living heap of straw across the saddle, bound it on, then led out the horse, gazing round cautiously as he did so; but the whole of the people of the Castle were feasting, and there was no one to watch the gates.  Richard heard the hollow sound of the hoofs, as the drawbridge was crossed, and knew that he was free; but still Osmond held his arm over him, and would not let him move, for some distance.  Then, just as Richard felt as if he could endure the stifling of the straw, and his uncomfortable position, not a moment longer, Osmond stopped the horse, took him down, laid him on the grass, and released him.  He gazed around; they were in a little wood; evening twilight was just coming on, and the birds sang sweetly.",lay living heap straw saddle bind lead horse gaze whole person feast be watch gate hear hollow sound hoof drawbridge cross know free hold arm let move distance feel endure stifling straw uncomfortable position moment stop horse take lay grass release gaze little wood evening twilight come bird sing

50,"Osmond helped the Duke to mount, and sprang to the saddle behind him, set spurs to the horse, and rode on at a quick rate, though not at full speed, as he wished to spare the horse.  The twilight faded, the stars came out, and still he rode, his arm round the child, who, as night advanced, grew weary, and often sunk into a sort of half doze, conscious all the time of the trot of the horse.  But each step was taking him further from Queen Gerberge, and nearer to Normandy; and what recked he of weariness?  On--on; the stars grew pale again, and the first pink light of dawn showed in the eastern sky; the sun rose, mounted higher and higher, and the day grew hotter; the horse went more slowly, stumbled, and though Osmond halted and loosed the girth, he only mended his pace for a little while.",help mount spring saddle set spur horse ride quick rate full speed wish spare horse twilight fade star come ride arm child night advance grow weary sink sort half doze conscious time trot horse step take reck weariness star grow pale first pink light dawn show eastern sky sun rise mount high high day grow hot horse go stumble halt loose girth mend pace little while 
51,"Osmond looked grievously perplexed; but they had not gone much further before a party of merchants came in sight, winding their way with a long train of loaded mules, and stout men to guard them, across the plains, like an eastern caravan in the desert.  They gazed in surprise at the tall young Norman holding the child upon the worn-out war-horse.",look perplex go party merchant come sight wind way long train load mule stout man guard plain eastern caravan desert gaze surprise tall young hold child wear out war horse 
52,"""Sir merchant,"" said Osmond to the first, ""see you this steed?  Better horse never was ridden; but he is sorely spent, and we must make speed. Let me barter him with you for yonder stout palfrey.  He is worth twice as much, but I cannot stop to chaffer--ay or no at once.""",merchant say first see steed good horse ride spend make speed let barter stout worth much stop chaffer 
53,"The merchant, seeing the value of Osmond's gallant black, accepted the offer; and Osmond removing his saddle, and placing Richard on his new steed, again mounted, and on they went through the country which Osmond's eye had marked with the sagacity men acquire by living in wild, unsettled places.  The great marshes were now far less dangerous than in the winter, and they safely crossed them.  There had, as yet, been no pursuit, and Osmond's only fear was for his little charge, who, not having recovered his full strength since his illness, began to suffer greatly from fatigue in the heat of that broiling summer day, and leant against Osmond patiently, but very wearily, without moving or looking up. He scarcely revived when the sun went down, and a cool breeze sprang up, which much refreshed Osmond himself; and still more did it refresh the Squire to see, at length, winding through the green pastures, a blue river, on the opposite bank of which rose a high rocky mound, bearing a castle with many a turret and battlement.",merchant see value gallant black accept offer remove saddle place new steed mount go country eye mark sagacity man acquire live wild unsettled place great marsh dangerous winter cross pursuit only fear little charge recover full strength illness begin suffer fatigue heat broil summer day lean move look revive sun go cool breeze spring refresh refresh see length wind green pasture blue river opposite bank rise high rocky mound bear castle many turret battlement 
54,"""The Epte! the Epte!  There is Normandy, sir!  Look up, and see your own dukedom.""  ""Normandy!"" cried Richard, sitting upright.  ""Oh, my own home!""  Still the Epte was wide and deep, and the peril was not yet ended.  Osmond looked anxiously, and rejoiced to see marks of cattle, as if it had been forded.  ""We must try it,"" he said, and dismounting, he waded in, leading the horse, and firmly holding Richard in the saddle. Deep they went; the water rose to Richard's feet, then to the horse's neck; then the horse was swimming, and Osmond too, still keeping his firm hold; then there was ground again, the force of the current was less, and they were gaining the bank.  At that instant, however, they perceived two men aiming at them with cross-bows from the castle, and another standing on the bank above them, who called out, ""Hold!  None pass the ford of Montemar without permission of the noble Dame Yolande.""  ""Ha! Bertrand, the Seneschal, is that you?"" returned Osmond.  ""Who calls me by my name?"" replied the Seneschal.  ""It is I, Osmond de Centeville.  Open your gates quickly, Sir Seneschal; for here is the Duke, sorely in need of rest and refreshment.""",be sir look see own dukedom cry sit own home wide deep peril end look rejoice see mark cattle ford try say dismount wade lead horse hold saddle deep go water rise foot horse neck horse swim keep firm hold be ground force current less gain bank instant perceive man aim cross -bow castle standing bank call hold pass ford permission noble return call name reply open gate need rest refreshment 
55,"""The Duke!"" exclaimed Bertrand, hurrying down to the landing-place, and throwing off his cap.  ""The Duke! the Duke!"" rang out the shout from the men-at-arms on the battlements above and in an instant more Osmond had led the horse up from the water, and was exclaiming, ""Look up, my Lord, look up!  You are in your own dukedom again, and this is Alberic's castle.""",exclaim hurry landing place throw cap ring shout man arm battlement instant more lead horse water exclaim look look own dukedom castle

57,"""He is sorely weary,"" said Osmond, looking anxiously at Richard, who, even at the welcome cries that showed so plainly that he was in his own Normandy, scarcely raised himself or spoke.  ""He had been very sick ere I brought him away.  I doubt me they sought to poison him, and I vowed not to tarry at Laon another hour after he was fit to move.  But cheer up, my Lord; you are safe and free now, and here is the good Dame de Montemar to tend you, far better than a rude Squire like me.""",weary say look welcome cry show own raise speak sick bring doubt seek poison vow tarry hour fit move cheer safe free good tend good rude squire

59,"Osmond, however, could scarcely rejoice, so alarmed was he at the extreme weariness and exhaustion of his charge, who, when they brought him into the Castle hall, hardly spoke or looked, and could not eat.  They carried him up to Alberic's bed, where he tossed about restlessly, too tired to sleep.",rejoice alarm extreme weariness exhaustion charge bring hall speak look eat carry bed toss tired sleep

61,"""Hush!  Sieur de Centeville,"" said the Seneschal's wife, coming into the room.  ""To talk in that manner is the way to be his death, indeed.  Leave the child to me--he is only over-weary.""",say wife come room talk manner way death leave child weary 
62,"Osmond was sure his Duke was among friends, and would have been glad to trust him to a woman; but Richard had but one instinct left in all his weakness and exhaustion--to cling close to Osmond, as if he felt him his only friend and protector; for he was, as yet, too much worn out to understand that he was in Normandy and safe.  For two or three hours, therefore, Osmond and the Seneschal's wife watched on each side of his bed, soothing his restlessness, until at length he became quiet, and at last dropped sound asleep.",sure friend glad trust woman have instinct leave weakness exhaustion cling feel only friend protector wear understand safe hour wife watch side bed soothing restlessness length become quiet last drop sound asleep 
63,"The sun was high in the heavens when Richard awoke.  He turned on his straw-filled crib, and looked up.  It was not the tapestried walls of his chamber at Laon that met his opening eyes, but the rugged stone and tall loop-hole window of a turret chamber.  Osmond de Centeville lay on the floor by his side, in the sound sleep of one overcome by long watching and weariness.  And what more did Richard see?",sun high heaven awoke turn straw fill crib look tapestried wall chamber meet open eye rugged stone tall loop hole window turret chamber lay floor side sound sleep overcome long watch weariness see 
64,"It was the bright face and sparkling eyes of Alberic de Montemar, who was leaning against the foot of his bed, gazing earnestly, as he watched for his waking.  There was a cry--""Alberic! Alberic!""  ""My Lord! my Lord!"" Richard sat up and held out both arms, and Alberic flung himself into them.  They hugged each other, and uttered broken exclamations and screams of joy, enough to have awakened any sleeper but one so wearied out as Osmond.",bright face sparkling eye lean foot bed gaze watch wake be cry sit hold arm flung hugge other utter break exclamation scream joy awaken sleeper weary

69,"Richard bounded to the window, and what a sight met his eyes! The Castle court was thronged with men-at-arms and horses, the morning sun sparkling on many a burnished hauberk and tall conical helmet, and above them waved many a banner and pennon that Richard knew full well.  ""There! there!"" he shouted aloud with glee.  ""Oh, there is the horse-shoe of Ferrieres! and there the chequers of Warenne!  Oh, and best of all, there is--there is our own red pennon of Centeville!  O Alberic!  Alberic! is Sir Eric here?

71,"""Yes, thanks to God!"" said Richard, crossing himself and kneeling reverently for some minutes, while he repeated his Latin prayer; then, rising and looking at Alberic, he said, ""I must thank Him, indeed, for he has saved Osmond and me from the cruel King and Queen, and I must try to be a less hasty and overbearing boy than I was when I went away; for I vowed that so I would be, if ever I came back.

72,"And, holding Alberic's hand, Richard left the room, and descended the stairs to the Castle hall.  Many of the Norman knights and barons, in full armour, were gathered there; but Richard looked only for one.  He knew Sir Eric's grizzled hair, and blue inlaid armour, though his back was towards him, and in a moment, before his entrance had been perceived, he sprang towards him, and, with outstretched arms, exclaimed: ""Sir Eric--dear Sir Eric, here I am!

And is Fru Astrida well?""",hold hand leave room descend stair hall many knight baron full armour gather look know grizzled hair blue inlaid armour back moment entrance perceive spring outstretched arm exclaim dear safe

74,"""And is Fru Astrida well?""",
75,"""Yes, right well, since she heard of your safety.  But look round, my Lord; it befits not a Duke to be clinging thus round an old man's neck.

76,"Richard stood up, and held out his hand, bowing courteously and acknowledging the greetings of each bold baron, with a grace and readiness he certainly had not when he left Normandy.  He was taller too; and though still pale, and not dressed with much care (since he had hurried on his clothes with no help but Alberic's)--though his hair was rough and disordered, and the scar of the burn had not yet faded from his check--yet still, with his bright blue eyes, glad face, and upright form, he was a princely, promising boy, and the Norman knights looked at him with pride and joy, more especially when, unprompted, he said: ""I thank you, gallant knights, for coming to guard me.

78,"Before the shout had died away, a bugle-horn was heard winding before the gate; and Sir Eric, saying, ""It is the Count of Harcourt's note,"" sent Bertrand to open the gates in haste, while Alberic followed, as Lord of the Castle, to receive the Count.",shout die bugle horn hear wind gate say note send open gate haste follow receive count 
79,"The old Count rode into the court, and to the foot of the steps, where he dismounted, Alberic holding his stirrup.  He had not taken many steps upwards before Richard came voluntarily to meet him (which he had never done before), held out his hand, and said, ""Welcome, Count Bernard, welcome.

83,"""You must thank Osmond for me,"" said Richard, as Osmond came down, awakened at length.  ""It is Osmond who has helped me to bear my troubles; and as to saving me, why he flew away with me even like an old eagle with its eaglet.

85,"What a glad summer's day was that! Even the three hours spent in council did but renew the relish with which Richard visited Alberic's treasures, told his adventures, and showed the accomplishments he had learnt at Laon.  The evening was more joyous still; for the Castle gates were opened, first to receive Dame Yolande Montemar, and not above a quarter of an hour afterwards, the drawbridge was lowered to admit the followers of Centeville; and in front of them appeared Fru Astrida's own high cap. Richard made but one bound into her arms, and was clasped to her breast; then held off at arm's-length, that she might see how much he was grown, and pity his scar; then hugged closer than ever: but, taking another look, she declared that Osmond left his hair like King Harald Horrid-locks; {16} and, drawing an ivory comb from her pouch, began to pull out the thick tangles, hurting him to a degree that would once have made him rebel, but now he only fondled her the more.",glad summer day hour spend council renew relish visit treasure tell adventure show accomplishment learn evening joyous gate open first receive quarter hour drawbridge lower admit follower front appear own high cap make bind arm clasp breast hold arm length see much grow pity scar hugge close take look declare leave hair lock } draw ivory comb pouch begin pull thick tangle hurt degree make rebel fondle more 
86,"As to Osmond, when he knelt before her, she blessed him, and sobbed over him, and blamed him for over-tiring her darling, all in one; and assuredly, when night closed in and Richard had, as of old, told his beads beside her knee, the happiest boy in Normandy was its little Duke.",knolt bless sobb blame tiring darling night close old tell bead knee happy boy little
