3," Amabel’s one anxiety was for Philip. For a long time nothing was heard of him at Hollywell, and she began to fear that he might have been less fit to take care of himself than he had persuaded her to believe. When at length tidings reached them, it was through the De Courcys. ‘Poor Morville,’ wrote Maurice, ‘had been carried ashore at Corfu, in the stupor of a second attack of fever. He had been in extreme danger for some time, and though now on the mend, was still unable to give any account of himself.’",anxiety long time hear begin fear fit take care persuade believe length tiding reach poor write carry stupor second attack fever extreme danger time mend unable give account 
4,"In effect, it was a relapse of the former disease, chiefly affecting the brain, and his impatience to leave Recoara, and free himself from Arnaud, had been a symptom of its approach, though it fortunately did not absolutely overpower him till after he had embarked for Corfu, and was in the way to be tended with the greatest solicitude. Long after the fever was subdued, and his strength returning, his mind was astray, and even when torturing delusions ceased, and he resumed the perception of surrounding objects, memory and reflection wavered in dizzy confusion, more distressing than either his bodily weakness, or the perpetual pain in his head, which no remedy could relieve.",effect relapse former disease affect brain impatience leave free symptom approach overpower embark way tend great solicitude fever subdued strength return mind astray torture delusion cease resume perception surround object memory reflection waver dizzy confusion distressing bodily weakness perpetual pain head remedy relieve 
5,"The first date to which he could afterwards recur, though for more than a week he had apparently been fully himself, was a time when he was sitting in an easy-chair by the window, obliged to avert his heavy eyes from the dazzling waters of the Corcyran bay, where Ulysses’ transformed ship gleamed in the sunshine, and the rich purple hills of Albania sloped upwards in the distance. James Thorndale was, as usual, with him, and was explaining that there had been a consultation between the doctor and the colonel, and they had decided that as there was not much chance of restoring his health in that climate in the spring.",first date recur more week time sit easy chair window oblige avert heavy eye dazzling water transform ship gleam sunshine rich purple hill slope distance usual explain be consultation doctor colonel decide be much chance restore health climate spring

8,"He let his head fall on his hand again, and listened with indifference when told he was to be sent to England at once, under the care of his servant, Bolton, and Mr. Thorndale himself, who was resolved to see him safe in his sister’s hands. He made no objection; he had become used to be passive, and one place was much the same to him as another; so he merely assented, without a question about the arrangements. Presently, however, he looked up, and inquired for his letters. Though he had done so before, the request had always been evaded, until now he spoke in a manner which decided his friend on giving him all except one with broad black edges, and Broadstone post-mark; the effect of which, it was thought, might be very injurious to his shattered nerves and spirits.",let head fall hand listen indifference tell send care servant resolve see safe sister hand make objection become use passive place same assent question arrangement look inquire letter do request evade speak manner decide friend give broad black edge post mark effect think injurious shattered nerve spirit

Let me have it.’",sister mention more month believe write able promise expect interrupt add be letter see be let have 
13,"His friend could not but comply, and had no reason to regret having done so; for after reading it twice, though he sighed deeply, and the tears were in his eyes, he was more calm and less oppressed than he had been at any time since his arrival in Corfu. He was unable to write, but Colonel Deane had undertaken to write to Mrs. Henley to announce his coming; and as the cause of his silence must be known at Hollywell, he resolved to let Amabel’s letter wait for a reply till his arrival in England.",friend comply have reason regret do read sigh tear eye calm oppress time arrival unable write undertake write announce come cause silence know resolve let letter wait reply arrival 
14,"It was on a chilly day in February that Mrs. Henley drove to the station to meet her brother, looking forward with a sister’s satisfaction to nursing his recovery, and feeling (for she had a heart, after all) as if it was a renewal of the days, which she regarded with a tenderness mixed with contempt, when all was confidence between the brother and sister, the days of nonsense and romance. She hoped that now poor Philip, who had acted hastily on his romance, and ruined his own prospects for her sake in his boyish days, had a chance of having it all made up to him, and reigning at Redclyffe according to her darling wish.",chilly day drive station meet brother look sister satisfaction nurse recovery feeling have heart renewal day regard tenderness mix contempt confidence brother sister day nonsense romance hope poor act romance ruin own prospect sake boyish day have chance have make reign accord darling wish 
15,"As she anxiously watched the arrival of the train, she recognized Mr. Thorndale, whom she had known in his school-days as Philip’s protege--but could that be her brother? It was his height, indeed; but his slow weary step as he crossed the platform, and left the care of his baggage to others, was so unlike his prompt, independent air, that she could hardly believe it to be himself, till, with his friend, he actually advanced to the carriage, and then she saw far deeper traces of illness than she was prepared for. A confusion of words took place; greetings on one hand, and partings on the other, for James Thorndale was going on by the train, and made only a few minutes’ halt in which to assure Mrs. Henley that though the landing and the journey had knocked up his patient to-day, he was much better since leaving Corfu, and to beg Philip to write as soon as possible. The bell rang, he rushed back, and was whirled away.",watch arrival train recognize know school day protege brother height slow weary step cross platform leave care baggage other prompt independent air believe friend advance carriage see deep trace illness prepare confusion word take place greeting hand parting other go train make few minute halt assure landing journey knock patient day good leave beg write possible bell ring rush whirl

31,"She was much shocked and grieved to see him so much more unwell than she had expected. He was unfit for anything but to go to bed on his arrival.

32,"There was no danger that Margaret would not lavish care enough on her brother. She waited on him in his room all the next day, bringing him everything he could want, and trying to make him come down-stairs, for she thought sitting alone there very bad for his spirits; but he said he had a letter to write, and very curious she was to know why he was so long doing it, and why he did not tell her to whom it was addressed.

The whole apartment was most luxurious, spacious, and richly furnished; the fire, in its brilliant steel setting, glancing on all around, and illuminating her own stately presence, and rich glace silk, as she sat opposite her brother cutting open the leaves of one of the books of the club over which she presided. She felt that this was something like attaining one of the objects for which she used to say and think she married,--namely, to be able to receive her brother in a comfortable home. If only he would but look more like himself.",last late see visitor call inquire evening close have satisfaction see enter draw room settle comfortable easy chair side fire wait doctor return dinner whole apartment luxurious spacious furnish fire brilliant steel setting glance illuminate own stately presence rich glace silk sit brother cut open leave book club preside feel attain object use say think marry able receive brother comfortable home look

92,"All the next day, Mrs. Henley wondered why her brother’s spirits were so much depressed, resisting every attempt to amuse or cheer them; but, on the third, she thought some light was thrown on the matter. She was at breakfast with the Doctor when the post came in, and there was a black-edged letter for Captain Morville, evidently from Amabel. She took it up at once to his room. He stretched out his hand for it eagerly, but laid it down, and would not open it while she was in the room. The instant she was gone, however, he broke the seal and read:--",next day wonder brother spirit depressed resist attempt amuse cheer third think light throw matter breakfast post come be black edged letter take room stretch hand lay open room instant gone break seal read

Everything from Amabel did him good; and he was so perceptibly better, that his sister exclaimed, when she was next alone with Dr. Henley, ‘I understand it all, poor fellow; I thought long ago, he had some secret attachment; and now I see it was to Amabel Edmonstone.’",simple letter call set fact comment commonplace word consolation speak volume spirit write resignation pardon soothing desire farewell last carry token perfect forgiveness do good good sister exclaim alone understand poor fellow think have secret attachment see

It was bad enough without this. Sometimes in nursery tales, a naughty child, under the care of a fairy, is chained to an exaggeration of himself and his own faults, and rendered a slave to this hateful self. The infliction he underwent in his sister’s house was somewhat analogous, for Mrs. Henley’s whole character, and especially her complacent speeches, were a strong resemblance of his own in the days he most regretted. He had ever since her marriage regarded her as a man looks at a fallen idol, but never had her alteration been so clear to him, as he had not spent much time with her, making her short visits, and passing the chief of each day at Stylehurst. Now, he was almost entirely at her mercy, and her unvarying kindness to him caused her deterioration to pain him all the more; while each self-assertion, or harsh judgment, sounded on his ear like a repetition of his worst and most hateful presumption. She little guessed what she made him endure, for he had resumed his wonted stoicism of demeanour, though the hardened crust that had once grown over his feelings had been roughly torn away, leaving an extreme soreness and tenderness to which an acute pang was given whenever he was reminded, not only of his injuries to Guy, but of the pride and secret envy that had been their root.",thank sister surmise favour make avoid subject spare hear much bad nursery tale naughty child care fairy chain exaggeration own fault render slave hateful self infliction underwent sister house analogous whole character complacent speech strong resemblance own day regret have marriage regard man look fall idol have alteration clear spend much time make short visit pass chief day mercy unvarying kindness cause deterioration pain more self assertion harsh judgment sound ear repetition bad hateful presumption guess make endure resume wont stoicism demeanour harden crust grow feeling tear leave extreme soreness tenderness acute pang give remind injury guy pride secret envy root

105,"He was soon able to resume the hours of the family, but was still far from well; suffering from languor, pain in the head, want of sleep and appetite; and an evening feverishness. He was unequal to deep reading, and was in no frame for light books; he could not walk far, and his sister’s literary coteries, which he had always despised, were at present beyond his powers of endurance. She hoped that society would divert his thoughts and raise his spirits, and arranged her parties with a view to him; but he never could stay long in the room, and Dr. Henley, who, though proud of his wife and her talents, had little pleasure in her learned circle, used to aid and abet his escape.",able resume hour family suffer languor pain head want sleep appetite evening feverishness unequal deep reading frame light book walk sister literary cotery despise present power endurance hope society divert thought raise spirit arrange party view stay room proud wife talent have little pleasure learn circle use aid abet escape 
106,"Thus Philip got through the hours as best he might, idly turning the pages of new club-books, wandering on the hills till he tired himself, sitting down to rest in the damp air, coming home chilled and fatigued, and lying on the sofa with his eyes shut, to avoid conversation, all the evening. Neither strength, energy, nor intellect would, serve him for more; and this, with the load and the stings of a profound repentance, formed his history through the next fortnight.",get hour good turn page new club book wonder hill tired sit rest damp air come chill fatigued lie sofa eye shut avoid conversation evening strength energy intellect serve more load sting profound repentance form history next fortnight
