2," The Campbells remained for some time on the shore of the lake watching the receding _bateaux_ until they turned round the point and were hidden from their sight, and then they walked back to the house. But few words were exchanged as they returned, for they felt a sensation of loneliness from having parted with so many of their own countrymen; not that they were, with the exception of Captain Sinclair, companions, but that, accustomed to the sight of the soldiers at their labor, the spot now appeared depopulated by their departure. Martin, too, and John, were both absent; the latter had been two days away, and Martin, who had not yet found time to ascertain where old Malachi Bone had fixed his new abode, had gone out in search of it, and to mention to him Mr. Campbell's wishes as to John's visits to him, which were becoming more frequent and more lengthened than Mr. Campbell wished them to be.",remain time shore lake watch reced _bateaux_ turn point hide sight walk house few word exchange return feel sensation loneliness part many own countryman exception companion accustom sight soldier labor spot appear depopulate departure absent latter day find time ascertain old fix new abode go search mention wish visit become frequent lengthen wish

4,"""Well, my dearest wife, here we are at last, left to ourselves and to our own resources. I am not at all doubtful of our doing well, if we exert ourselves, as it is our duty to do. I grant that we may have hardship to combat, difficulties to overcome, occasional disappointments and losses to bear up against; but let us recollect how greatly we have, through Providence, been already assisted and encouraged, how much help we have received, and how much kindness we have experienced. Surely we ought to feel most grateful to Heaven for blessings already vouchsafed to us, and ought to have a firm and lively faith in _Him_, who has hitherto so kindly watched over us. Let us not then repine or feel dispirited, but with grateful hearts do our duty cheerfully in that state of life to which it has pleased _Him_ to call us.""",dearest wife last leave own resource doubtful do exert duty do grant have hardship combat difficulty overcome occasional disappointment loss bear let recollect assist encourage much help receive much kindness experience feel grateful blessing vouchsafe have firm lively faith watch let repine feel dispirited grateful heart do duty state life pleased call 
5,"""I agree with you, my dear husband,"" replied Mrs. Campbell; ""nay, I can say with sincerity, that I am not sorry we are now left to our own exertions, and that we have an opportunity of proving that we _can_ do without the assistance of others. Up to the present, our trial has been nothing; indeed, I can not fancy to myself what our trials are to be. Come they may, but from what quarter I can not form an idea: should they come, however, I trust we shall show our gratitude for the past blessings, and our faith derived from past deliverances, by a devout submission to whatever the Almighty may please to try or chasten us with.""",agree dear husband reply say sincerity sorry leave own exertion have opportunity prove do assistance other present trial fancy trial come quarter form idea come trust show gratitude past blessing faith derive past deliverance devout submission please try chast
