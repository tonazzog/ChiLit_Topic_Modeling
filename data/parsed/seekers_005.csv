1,CHAPTER 5. THE POET AND THE EDITOR,chapter poet editor 
2,"It was not bad sport--being in London entirely on our own hook. We asked the way to Fleet Street, where Father says all the newspaper offices are. They said straight on down Ludgate Hill--but it turned out to be quite another way. At least _we_ didn’t go straight on.",bad sport own hook ask way say newspaper office say turn way least go 
3,"We got to St Paul’s. Noel _would_ go in, and we saw where Gordon was buried--at least the monument. It is very flat, considering what a man he was.",get go see bury least monument flat consider man 
4,"When we came out we walked a long way, and when we asked a policeman he said we’d better go back through Smithfield. So we did. They don’t burn people any more there now, so it was rather dull, besides being a long way, and Noel got very tired. He’s a peaky little chap; it comes of being a poet, I think. We had a bun or two at different shops--out of the shillings--and it was quite late in the afternoon when we got to Fleet Street. The gas was lighted and the electric lights. There is a jolly Bovril sign that comes off and on in different coloured lamps. We went to the Daily Recorder office, and asked to see the Editor. It is a big office, very bright, with brass and mahogany and electric lights.",come walk long way ask policeman say go burn person dull long way get tired peaky little chap come poet think have bun different shop shilling late afternoon get gas light electric light be jolly sign come different coloured lamp go daily office ask see editor big office bright brass mahogany electric light 
5,"They told us the Editor wasn’t there, but at another office. So we went down a dirty street, to a very dull-looking place. There was a man there inside, in a glass case, as if he was a museum, and he told us to write down our names and our business. So Oswald wrote--",tell editor office go dirty street dull look place be man glass case museum tell write name business write 
6,           OSWALD BASTABLE             NOEL BASTABLE       BUSINESS VERY PRIVATE INDEED,private 
7,"Then we waited on the stone stairs; it was very draughty. And the man in the glass case looked at us as if we were the museum instead of him. We waited a long time, and then a boy came down and said--",wait stone stair draughty man glass case look museum wait long time boy come say 
8,‘The Editor can’t see you. Will you please write your business?’ And he laughed. I wanted to punch his head.,editor see write business laugh want punch head 
9,"But Noel said, ‘Yes, I’ll write it if you’ll give me a pen and ink, and a sheet of paper and an envelope.’",say write give pen ink sheet paper envelope 
10,"The boy said he’d better write by post. But Noel is a bit pig-headed; it’s his worst fault. So he said--‘No, I’ll write it _now_.’ So I backed him up by saying--",boy say write post bit pig head bad fault say write back say 
11,‘Look at the price penny stamps are since the coal strike!’,look price penny stamp coal strike 
12,"So the boy grinned, and the man in the glass case gave us pen and paper, and Noel wrote. Oswald writes better than he does; but Noel would do it; and it took a very long time, and then it was inky.",boy grin man glass case give pen paper write write good do take long time inky 
13,"    DEAR MR EDITOR, I want you to print my poetry and pay for it,     and I am a friend of Mrs Leslie’s; she is a poet too.",dear want print poetry pay friend poet 
14,"    Your affectionate friend,",affectionate friend 
15,    NOEL BASTABLE.,
16,"He licked the envelope a good deal, so that that boy shouldn’t read it going upstairs; and he wrote ‘Very private’ outside, and gave the letter to the boy. I thought it wasn’t any good; but in a minute the grinning boy came back, and he was quite respectful, and said--‘The Editor says, please will you step up?’",lick envelope good deal boy read go write private give letter boy think good minute grinning boy come respectful say editor say step 
17,"We stepped up. There were a lot of stairs and passages, and a queer sort of humming, hammering sound and a very funny smell. The boy was now very polite, and said it was the ink we smelt, and the noise was the printing machines.",step be lot stair passage queer sort hum hammer sound funny smell boy polite say ink smell noise printing machine 
18,"After going through a lot of cold passages we came to a door; the boy opened it, and let us go in. There was a large room, with a big, soft, blue-and-red carpet, and a roaring fire, though it was only October; and a large table with drawers, and littered with papers, just like the one in Father’s study. A gentleman was sitting at one side of the table; he had a light moustache and light eyes, and he looked very young to be an editor--not nearly so old as Father. He looked very tired and sleepy, as if he had got up very early in the morning; but he was kind, and we liked him. Oswald thought he looked clever. Oswald is considered a judge of faces.",go lot cold passage come door boy open let go be large room big soft blue red carpet roar fire large table drawer litter paper one study gentleman sit side table have light moustache light eye look young editor old look tired sleepy get morning kind like think look clever consider judge face 
19,"‘Well,’ said he, ‘so you are Mrs Leslie’s friends?’",say friend 
20,"‘I think so,’ said Noel; ‘at least she gave us each a shilling, and she wished us “good hunting!”’",think say least give shilling wish good hunting 
21,"‘Good hunting, eh? Well, what about this poetry of yours? Which is the poet?’",good hunting poetry poet 
22,"I can’t think how he could have asked! Oswald is said to be a very manly-looking boy for his age. However, I thought it would look duffing to be offended, so I said--",think ask say manly look boy age think look duff offend say 
23,"‘This is my brother Noel. He is the poet.’ Noel had turned quite pale. He is disgustingly like a girl in some ways. The Editor told us to sit down, and he took the poems from Noel, and began to read them. Noel got paler and paler; I really thought he was going to faint, like he did when I held his hand under the cold-water tap, after I had accidentally cut him with my chisel. When the Editor had read the first poem--it was the one about the beetle--he got up and stood with his back to us. It was not manners; but Noel thinks he did it ‘to conceal his emotion,’ as they do in books. He read all the poems, and then he said--",brother poet turn pale girl way editor tell sit take poem begin read get paler paler think go faint hold hand cold water tap cut chisel read first poem one beetle get stand back manners think do conceal emotion do book read poem say 
24,"‘I like your poetry very much, young man. I’ll give you--let me see; how much shall I give you for it?’",like poetry much young man give let see give 
25,"‘As much as ever you can,’ said Noel. ‘You see I want a good deal of money to restore the fallen fortunes of the house of Bastable.’",much say see want good deal money restore fall fortune house 
26,The gentleman put on some eye-glasses and looked hard at us. Then he sat down.,gentleman put eye glasses look sit 
27,"‘That’s a good idea,’ said he. ‘Tell me how you came to think of it. And, I say, have you had any tea? They’ve just sent out for mine.’",good idea say tell come think say have tea send 
28,"He rang a tingly bell, and the boy brought in a tray with a teapot and a thick cup and saucer and things, and he had to fetch another tray for us, when he was told to; and we had tea with the Editor of the Daily Recorder. I suppose it was a very proud moment for Noel, though I did not think of that till afterwards. The Editor asked us a lot of questions, and we told him a good deal, though of course I did not tell a stranger all our reasons for thinking that the family fortunes wanted restoring. We stayed about half an hour, and when we were going away he said again--",ring tingly bell boy bring tray teapot thick cup saucer thing have fetch tray tell have tea editor daily suppose proud moment think editor ask lot question tell good deal course tell stranger reason think family fortune want restore stay hour go say 
29,"‘I shall print all your poems, my poet; and now what do you think they’re worth?’",print poem poet think worth 
30,"‘I don’t know,’ Noel said. ‘You see I didn’t write them to sell.’",know say see write sell 
31,‘Why did you write them then?’ he asked.,write ask 
32,Noel said he didn’t know; he supposed because he wanted to.,say know suppose want 
33,"‘Art for Art’s sake, eh?’ said the Editor, and he seemed quite delighted, as though Noel had said something clever.",art sake say editor seem delighted say clever 
34,"‘Well, would a guinea meet your views?’ he asked.",guinea meet view ask 
35,"I have read of people being at a loss for words, and dumb with emotion, and I’ve read of people being turned to stone with astonishment, or joy, or something, but I never knew how silly it looked till I saw Noel standing staring at the Editor with his mouth open. He went red and he went white, and then he got crimson, as if you were rubbing more and more crimson lake on a palette. But he didn’t say a word, so Oswald had to say--",read person loss word dumb emotion read person turn stone astonishment joy know silly look see stand stare editor mouth open go red go white get crimson rub more more crimson lake palette say word have say 
36,‘I should jolly well think so.’,think 
37,"So the Editor gave Noel a sovereign and a shilling, and he shook hands with us both, but he thumped Noel on the back and said--",editor give sovereign shilling shake hand thump back say 
38,"‘Buck up, old man! It’s your first guinea, but it won’t be your last. Now go along home, and in about ten years you can bring me some more poetry. Not before--see? I’m just taking this poetry of yours because I like it very much; but we don’t put poetry in this paper at all. I shall have to put it in another paper I know of.’",buck old man first guinea last go home year bring more poetry see take poetry like put poetry paper have put paper know 
39,"‘What _do_ you put in your paper?’ I asked, for Father always takes the Daily Chronicle, and I didn’t know what the Recorder was like. We chose it because it has such a glorious office, and a clock outside lighted up.",_do_ put paper ask take daily know recorder choose have glorious office clock light 
40,"‘Oh, news,’ said he, ‘and dull articles, and things about Celebrities. If you know any Celebrities, now?’",news say dull article thing celebrity know celebrity 
41,Noel asked him what Celebrities were.,ask celebrity 
42,"‘Oh, the Queen and the Princes, and people with titles, and people who write, or sing, or act--or do something clever or wicked.’",person title person write sing act do clever wicked 
43,"‘I don’t know anybody wicked,’ said Oswald, wishing he had known Dick Turpin, or Claude Duval, so as to be able to tell the Editor things about them. ‘But I know some one with a title--Lord Tottenham.’",know wicked say wish know able tell editor thing know one title 
44,"‘The mad old Protectionist, eh? How did you come to know him?’",mad old protectionist come know 
45,"‘We don’t know him to speak to. But he goes over the Heath every day at three, and he strides along like a giant--with a black cloak like Lord Tennyson’s flying behind him, and he talks to himself like one o’clock.’",know speak go day stride giant black cloak fly talk o'clock 
46,"‘What does he say?’ The Editor had sat down again, and he was fiddling with a blue pencil.",say sit fiddle blue pencil 
47,"‘We only heard him once, close enough to understand, and then he said, “The curse of the country, sir--ruin and desolation!” And then he went striding along again, hitting at the furze-bushes as if they were the heads of his enemies.’",hear close understand say curse country sir ruin desolation go strid hit furze bush head enemy 
48,"‘Excellent descriptive touch,’ said the Editor. ‘Well, go on.’",excellent descriptive touch say editor go 
49,"‘That’s all I know about him, except that he stops in the middle of the Heath every day, and he looks all round to see if there’s any one about, and if there isn’t, he takes his collar off.’",know stop middle day look see be one be take collar 
50,The Editor interrupted--which is considered rude--and said--,editor interrupt consider rude say 
51,‘You’re not romancing?’,romance 
52,"‘I beg your pardon?’ said Oswald. ‘Drawing the long bow, I mean,’ said the Editor.",beg pardon say draw long bow mean say editor 
53,"Oswald drew himself up, and said he wasn’t a liar.",draw say liar 
54,"The Editor only laughed, and said romancing and lying were not at all the same; only it was important to know what you were playing at. So Oswald accepted his apology, and went on.",editor laugh say romancing lying same important know play accept apology go 
55,"‘We were hiding among the furze-bushes one day, and we saw him do it. He took off his collar, and he put on a clean one, and he threw the other among the furze-bushes. We picked it up afterwards, and it was a beastly paper one!’",hide furze bush day see do take collar put clean one throw other furze bush pick beastly paper one 
56,"‘Thank you,’ said the Editor, and he got up and put his hand in his pocket. ‘That’s well worth five shillings, and there they are. Would you like to see round the printing offices before you go home?’",thank say editor get put hand pocket worth shilling like see printing office go 
57,"I pocketed my five bob, and thanked him, and I said we should like it very much. He called another gentleman and said something we couldn’t hear. Then he said good-bye again; and all this time Noel hadn’t said a word. But now he said, ‘I’ve made a poem about you. It is called “Lines to a Noble Editor.” Shall I write it down?’",pocket bob thank say like call gentleman say hear say good time say word say make poem call noble write 
58,"The Editor gave him the blue pencil, and he sat down at the Editor’s table and wrote. It was this, he told me afterwards as well as he could remember--",editor give blue pencil sit table write tell remember 
59,    May Life’s choicest blessings be your lot     I think you ought to be very blest     For you are going to print my poems--     And you may have this one as well as the rest.,life choicest blessing lot think good go print poem have one rest 
60,"‘Thank you,’ said the Editor. ‘I don’t think I ever had a poem addressed to me before. I shall treasure it, I assure you.’",thank say editor think have poem address treasure assure 
61,"Then the other gentleman said something about Maecenas, and we went off to see the printing office with at least one pound seven in our pockets.",other gentleman say go see printing office least pound pocket 
62,"It _was_ good hunting, and no mistake!",good hunting mistake 
63,"But he never put Noel’s poetry in the Daily Recorder. It was quite a long time afterwards we saw a sort of story thing in a magazine, on the station bookstall, and that kind, sleepy-looking Editor had written it, I suppose. It was not at all amusing. It said a lot about Noel and me, describing us all wrong, and saying how we had tea with the Editor; and all Noel’s poems were in the story thing. I think myself the Editor seemed to make game of them, but Noel was quite pleased to see them printed--so that’s all right. It wasn’t my poetry anyhow, I am glad to say.",put poetry daily long time see sort story thing magazine station bookstall kind sleepy look editor write suppose amusing say lot describe wrong say have tea editor poem story thing think seem make game pleased see print right poetry glad say
