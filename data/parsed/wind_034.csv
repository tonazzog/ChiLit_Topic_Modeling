1,CHAPTER XXXIV. IN THE COUNTRY,country 
2," BEFORE the end of the month, Ruby had got respectably thin, and Diamond respectably stout. They really began to look fit for double harness.",end month get thin stout begin look fit double harness 
3,"Joseph and his wife got their affairs in order, and everything ready for migrating at the shortest notice; and they felt so peaceful and happy that they judged all the trouble they had gone through well worth enduring. As for Nanny, she had been so happy ever since she left the hospital, that she expected nothing better, and saw nothing attractive in the notion of the country. At the same time, she had not the least idea of what the word country meant, for she had never seen anything about her but streets and gas-lamps. Besides, she was more attached to Jim than to Diamond: Jim was a reasonable being, Diamond in her eyes at best only an amiable, over-grown baby, whom no amount of expostulation would ever bring to talk sense, not to say think it. Now that she could manage the baby as well as he, she judged herself altogether his superior. Towards his father and mother, she was all they could wish.",wife get affair order ready migrate short notice feel peaceful happy judge trouble go worth endure happy leave hospital expect good see attractive notion country same time have least idea word country mean see street gas lamp attach reasonable being eye good amiable grow baby amount expostulation bring talk sense say think manage baby judge superior father mother wish 
4,"Diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find Jim, and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman, who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child. Jim had moved his quarters, and had not heard of Nanny’s illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital, where he was too shy to go and inquire about her. But when at length she went to live with Diamond’s family, Jim was willing enough to go and see her. It was after one of his visits, during which they had been talking of her new prospects, that Nanny expressed to Diamond her opinion of the country.",take great deal pain trouble find succeed help tall policeman glad renew acquaintance strange child move quarter hear illness time take hospital shy go inquire length go live family willing go see visit talk new prospect express opinion country

8,"“Ain’t they? They’re so beautiful, they make you happy to look at them.”",beautiful make happy look 
9,“That’s because you’re such a silly.”,silly 
10,"Diamond smiled with a far-away look, as if he were gazing through clouds of green leaves and the vision contented him. But he was thinking with himself what more he could do for Nanny; and that same evening he went to find Mr. Raymond, for he had heard that he had returned to town.",smile look gaze cloud green leave vision content think more do same evening go find hear return town 
11,"“Ah! how do you do, Diamond?” said Mr. Raymond; “I am glad to see you.”",do say glad see 
12,"And he was indeed, for he had grown very fond of him. His opinion of him was very different from Nanny’s.",grow fond opinion different 
13,"“What do you want now, my child?” he asked.",want child ask 
14,"“I’m always wanting something, sir,” answered Diamond.",want sir answer 
15,"“Well, that’s quite right, so long as what you want is right. Everybody is always wanting something; only we don’t mention it in the right place often enough. What is it now?”",right want right want mention right place 
16,"“There’s a friend of Nanny’s, a lame boy, called Jim.”",be friend lame boy call 
17,"“I’ve heard of him,” said Mr. Raymond. “Well?”",hear say 
18,"“Nanny doesn’t care much about going to the country, sir.”",care much go country sir

20,"“You couldn’t find a corner for Jim to work in--could you, sir?”",find corner work sir 
21,"“I don’t know that I couldn’t. That is, if you can show good reason for it.”",know show good reason 
22,"“He’s a good boy, sir.”",good boy sir 
23,"“Well, so much the better for him.”",good 
24,"“I know he can shine boots, sir.”",know shine boot sir

27,"“Yes, to be sure.”",sure 
28,"“It wouldn’t be nice to walk over the flowers with dirty boots--would it, sir?”",nice walk flower dirty boot sir 
29,"“No, indeed.”",
30,“They wouldn’t like it--would they?”,like 
31,"“No, they wouldn’t.”",
32,"“Then Nanny would be better pleased to go, sir.”",pleased go sir 
33,"“If the flowers didn’t like dirty boots to walk over them, Nanny wouldn’t mind going to the country? Is that it? I don’t quite see it.”",flower like dirty boot walk mind go country see 
34,"“No, sir; I didn’t mean that. I meant, if you would take Jim with you to clean your boots, and do odd jobs, you know, sir, then Nanny would like it better. She’s so fond of Jim!”",sir mean mean take clean boot do odd job know sir like good fond 
35,"“Now you come to the point, Diamond. I see what you mean, exactly. I will turn it over in my mind. Could you bring Jim to see me?”",come point see mean turn mind bring see 
36,"“I’ll try, sir. But they don’t mind me much. They think I’m silly,”  added Diamond, with one of his sweetest smiles.",try sir mind think silly add sweetest smile 
37,"What Mr. Raymond thought, I dare hardly attempt to put down here. But one part of it was, that the highest wisdom must ever appear folly to those who do not possess it.",think attempt put part high wisdom appear folly possess 
38,"“I think he would come though--after dark, you know,” Diamond continued. “He does well at shining boots. People’s kind to lame boys, you know, sir. But after dark, there ain’t so much doing.”",think come dark know continue shine boot person kind lame boy know sir dark much do 
39,"Diamond succeeded in bringing Jim to Mr. Raymond, and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance. He provided new clothes for both him and Nanny; and upon a certain day, Joseph took his wife and three children, and Nanny and Jim, by train to a certain station in the county of Kent, where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to The Mound, which was the name of Mr. Raymond’s new residence. I will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went, or when they arrived. All I will say is, that Diamond, who is my only care, was full of quiet delight--a gladness too deep to talk about.",succeed bring consequence resolve give boy chance provide new clothes certain day take wife child train certain station county find cart wait carry luggage name new residence describe varied feeling party go arrive say only care full quiet delight gladness deep talk 
40,"Joseph returned to town the same night, and the next morning drove Ruby and Diamond down, with the carriage behind them, and Mr. Raymond and a lady in the carriage. For Mr. Raymond was an old bachelor no longer: he was bringing his wife with him to live at The Mound. The moment Nanny saw her, she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring. That ring had been given her by Mr. Raymond.",return town same night next morning drive carriage lady carriage old bachelor bring wife live moment see recognise lady loan ruby ring ring give 
41,"The weather was very hot, and the woods very shadowy. There were not a great many wild flowers, for it was getting well towards autumn, and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves, because if they did not, they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them. So they have their fun over, and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed. But there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house, and Diamond’s chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them, and breathe the pure air. But all the time, he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind, and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing. For this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it. Sometimes he would have his little brother, sometimes his little sister, and sometimes both of them in the grass with him, and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens, he said, only he couldn’t purr--all he could do was to sing.",weather hot wood shadowy be great many wild flower get autumn most wild flower rise leave get glimpse sun have fun ready go bed time tree dress be plenty loveliest grass daisy house chief pleasure seem lie breathe pure air time dreaming country back north wind try recall song river use sing back north wind know leave have little brother little sister grass feel cat first kitten say purr do sing 
42,"These were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab, but you must not suppose that Diamond was idle. He did not do so much for his mother now, because Nanny occupied his former place; but he helped his father still, both in the stable and the harness-room, and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair, and be ready to open the carriage-door. Mr. Raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty.",different time use drive cab suppose idle do much mother occupy former place help father stable harness room go box learn drive pair ready open carriage door advise father give plenty liberty 
43,"“A boy like that,” he said, “ought not to be pushed.”",boy say push 
44,"Joseph assented heartily, smiling to himself at the idea of pushing Diamond. After doing everything that fell to his share, the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal. And a happy, sometimes a merry time it was. Only for two months or so, he neither saw nor heard anything of North Wind.",assent smile idea push do fall share boy have wealth time disposal happy merry time month see hear
