3," It had long been a promise that Mr. Edmonstone should take Charlotte to visit her grandmamma, in Ireland. They would have gone last autumn, but for Guy’s illness, and now Aunt Charlotte wrote to hasten the performance of the project. Lady Mabel was very anxious to see them, she said; and having grown much more infirm of late, seemed to think it would be the last meeting with her son. She talked so much of Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura, that it was plain that she wished extremely for a visit from them, though she did not like to ask it, in the present state of the family.",promise take visit grandmamma go last autumn guy illness write hast performance project anxious see say grow infirm late seem think last meeting son talk much plain wish visit like ask present state family 
4,"A special invitation was sent to Bustle; indeed, Charles said Charlotte could not have gone without his permission, for he reigned like a tyrant over her, evidently believing her created for no purpose but to wait on him, and take him to walk.",special invitation send say go permission reign tyrant believe create purpose wait take walk 
5,"Laura was a great favourite at the cottage of Kilcoran, and felt she ought to offer to go. Philip fully agreed, and held out home hopes of following as soon as the session, was over, and he had been to Redclyffe about some business that had been deferred too long.",great favourite cottage feel offer go agree hold home hope follow session business deferre 
6,"And now it appeared that Mr. Edmonstone had a great desire to take his wife, and she herself said, that under any other circumstances she should have been very desirous of going. She had not been to Ireland for fifteen years, and was sorry to have seen so little of her mother-in-law; and now that it had been proved that Charles could exist without her, she would not have hesitated to leave him, but for Amabel’s state of health and spirits, which made going from home out of the question.",appear have great desire take wife say other circumstance desirous go year sorry see little mother law prove exist hesitate leave state health spirit make go home question 
7,"Charles and Amabel did not think so. It was not to be endured, that when grandmamma wished for her, she should stay at home for them without real necessity; besides, the fatigue, anxiety, and sorrow she had undergone of late, had told on her, and had made her alter perceptibly, from being remarkably fresh and youthful, to be somewhat aged; and the change to a new scene, where she could not be distressing herself at every failure in cheerfulness of poor Amy’s, was just the thing to do her good.",think endure grandmamma wish stay home real necessity fatigue anxiety sorrow undergone late tell make alter fresh youthful aged change new scene distress failure cheerfulness poor thing do good 
8,"Amabel was not afraid of the sole charge of Charles or of the baby, for she had been taught but too well to manage for herself, she understood Charles very well, and had too much quiet good sense to be fanciful about her very healthy baby. Though she was inexperienced, with old nurse hard by, and Dr. Mayerne at Broadstone, there was no fear of her not having good counsel enough. She was glad to be of some use, by enabling her mother to leave Charles, and her only fear was of being dull company for him; but as he was so kind as to bear it, she would do her best, and perhaps their neighbours would come and enliven him sometimes.",afraid sole charge baby teach manage understand have much quiet good sense fanciful healthy baby inexperienced old nurse be fear have good counsel glad use enable mother leave only fear dull company kind bear do good neighbour come enlive 
9,"Charles threw his influence into the same scale. His affectionate observation had shown him that it oppressed Amabel’s spirits to be the object of such constant solicitude, and he was convinced it would be better for her, both to have some necessary occupation and to be free from that perpetual mournful watching of her mother’s that caused her to make the efforts to be cheerful which did her more harm than anything else.",throw influence same scale affectionate observation show oppress spirit object such constant solicitude convinced good have necessary occupation free perpetual mournful watch mother cause make effort cheerful do more harm else 
10,"To let her alone to look and speak as she pleased without the fear of paining and disappointing those she loved, keep the house quiet, and give her the employment of household cares and attending on himself, was, he thought, the best thing for her; and he was full of eagerness and pleasure at the very notion of being of service to her, if only by being good for nothing but to be waited on. He thought privately that the spring of his mother’s mind had been so much injured by the grief she had herself suffered for ‘her son Guy,’ her cruel disappointment in Laura, and the way in which she threw herself into all Amy’s affliction, that there was a general depression in her way of observing and attending Amy, which did further harm; and that to change the current of her thoughts, and bring her home refreshed and inspirited, would be the beginning of improvement in all. Or, as he expressed it to Dr. Mayerne, ‘We shall set off on a new tack.’",let look speak pleased fear pain disappoint love keep house quiet give employment household care attend think good thing full eagerness pleasure very notion service good wait think spring mother mind injure grief suffer son cruel disappointment way throw affliction be general depression way observe attend do further harm change current thought bring home refresh inspirite beginning improvement express set new tack 
11,"His counsel and Mr. Edmonstone’s wishes at length decided mamma, on condition that Mary Ross and Dr. Mayerne would promise to write on alternate weeks a full report, moral and physical, as Charles called it. So in due time the goods were packed, Mrs. Edmonstone cried heartily over the baby, advised Amabel endlessly about her, and finally looked back through her tears, as she drove away, to see Charles nodding and waving his hand at the bay-window, and Amabel standing with her parting smile and good-bye on the steps.",counsel wish length decide mamma condition promise write alternate week full report moral physical call due time goods pack cry baby advise look tear drive see nodd wave hand bay window stand parting smile good bye step 
12,"The reports, moral and physical, proved that Charles had judged wisely. Amabel was less languid as she had more cause for exertion, and seemed relieved by the absence of noise and hurry, spending more time down-stairs, and appearing less weary in the evening. She still avoided the garden, but she began to like short drives with her brother in the pony-carriage, when he drove on in silence, and let her lean back and gaze up into the sky, or into the far distance, undisturbed. Now and then he would be rejoiced by a bright, genuine smile, perfectly refreshing, at some of the pretty ways of the babe, a small but plump and lively creature, beginning to grasp with her hands, laugh and gaze about with eyes that gave promise of the peculiar colour and brilliancy of her father’s. Amabel was afraid she might be tempted into giving Charles too much of the little lady’s society; but he was very fond of her, regarding her with an odd mixture of curiosity and amusement, much entertained with watching what he called her unaccountable manners, and greatly flattered when he could succeed in attracting her notice. Indeed, the first time she looked full at him with a smile on the verge of a laugh, it completely overcame him, by the indescribably forcible manner in which it suddenly recalled the face which had always shone on him like a sunbeam. Above all, it was worth anything to see the looks she awoke in her mother, for which he must have loved her, even had she not been Guy’s child.",report moral physical prove judge languid have more cause exertion seem relieve absence noise hurry spend more time stair appear weary evening avoid garden begin like short drive brother pony carriage drive silence let lean gaze sky far distance undisturbed rejoice bright genuine smile refresh pretty way babe small plump lively creature begin grasp hand laugh gaze eye give promise peculiar colour brilliancy father afraid tempt give much little lady society fond regard odd mixture curiosity amusement entertain watch call unaccountable manners flatter succeed attract notice first time look full smile verge laugh overcame forcible manner recall face shine sunbeam worth see look awoke mother love guy child 
13,"In the evening, especially on Sunday, Amabel would sometimes talk to him as she had never yet been able to do, about her last summer’s journey, and her stay at Recoara, and his way of listening and answering had in it something that gave her great pleasure; while, on his side, he deemed each fresh word of Guy’s a sort of treasure for which to be grateful to her. The brother and sister were a great help and happiness to each other; Amabel found herself restored to Charles, as Guy had liked to think of her, and Charles felt as if the old childish fancies were fulfilled, in which he and Amy were always to keep house together. He was not in the least dull; and though his good-natured visitors in the morning were welcome, and received with plenty of his gay lively talk, he did not by any means stand in need of the compassion they felt for him, and could have done very well without them; while the evenings alone with Amy had in them something so pleasant that they were almost better than those when Mr. Ross and Mary came to tea. He wrote word to his mother that she might be quite at ease about them, and he thought Amy would get through the anniversaries of September better while the house was quiet, so that she need not think of trying to hurry home.",evening talk able do last summer journey stay way listen answer have give great pleasure side deem fresh word sort treasure grateful brother sister great help happiness other find restore like think feel old childish fancy fulfil keep house least dull good natured visitor morning welcome receive plenty gay lively talk means stand need compassion feel do evening have pleasant good come tea write word mother ease think get anniversary good house quiet think try hurry 
14,"He was glad to have done so, for the letters, which scarcely missed a day in being written by his mother and Charlotte, seemed to show that their stay was likely to be long. Lady Mabel was more broken than they had expected, and claimed a long visit, as she was sure it would be their last, while the Kilcoran party had taken possession of Laura and Charlotte, as if they never meant to let them go. Charlotte wrote her brother very full and very droll accounts of the Iricisms around her which she enjoyed thoroughly, and Charles, declaring he never expected to see little Charlotte come out in the character of the facetious correspondent, used to send Mary Ross into fits of laughing by what he read to her. Mr. Fielder, the tutor, wrote Charlotte, was very nearly equal to Eveleen’s description of him, but very particularly agreeable, in fact, the only man who had any conversation, whom she had seen since she had been at Kilcoran.",glad do letter miss day write mother seem show stay likely long broken expect claim long visit sure last take possession mean let go write brother full droll account enjoy declare expect see little come character facetious correspondent use send fit laugh read tutor write equal description agreeable fact only man have conversation see

Lord Kilcoran has asked him to come and stay here, and Mabel and I are quite sure he comes for a purpose. Of course he has chosen this time, in order that he may be able to have his companion before his eyes, as a model for courtship, and I wish I had you to help me look on whenever Philip comes, as that laugh I must enjoy alone with Bustle. However, when Philip will come we cannot think, for we have heard nothing of him this age, not even Laura, and she is beginning to look very anxious about him. Do tell us if you know anything about him. The last letter was when parliament was prorogued, and he was going to Redclyffe, at least three weeks ago.’",last event call seem wander pius leave army get diplomatic appointment ask come stay sure come purpose course choose time order able have companion eye model courtship wish have help look come laugh enjoy come think hear age begin look anxious tell know last letter parliament prorogue go least week

23,"‘Ah! here it is. Listen, Charlie. “Mr. Morville has been here for the last few weeks, and is, I fear, very unwell. He has been entirely confined to the house, almost ever since his arrival, by violent headache, which has completely disabled him from attending to business; but he will not call in any advice. I make a point of going to see him every day, though I believe my presence is anything but acceptable, as in his present state of health and spirits, I cannot think it right that he should be left to servants.” Poor fellow!

26,"She did so, and on the third day they drove again to fetch the answer. It was a much worse account. Mr. Morville was, said Markham, suffering dreadfully from headache, and lay on the sofa all day, almost unable to speak or move, but resolved against having medical advice, though his own treatment of himself did not at all succeed in relieving him. There was extreme depression of spirits, and an unwillingness to see any one. He had positively refused to admit either Lord Thorndale or Mr. Ashford, and would hardly bear to see Markham himself, who, indeed, only forced his presence on him from thinking it unfit to leave him entirely to the servants, and would be much relieved if some of Mr. Morville’s friends were present to free him from the responsibility.",third day drive fetch answer bad account say suffer headache lay sofa day unable speak move resolve have medical advice own treatment succeed relieve be extreme depression spirit unwillingness see one refuse admit bear see force presence think unfit leave servant relieve friend present free responsibility

He undertook to announce the plan to his mother, and she said she would write to tell Mr. Markham that as far as could be reckoned on two such frail people, they would be at Redclyffe the next evening, and he must use his own discretion about giving Mr. Morville the note which she enclosed.",meet smile show determine undertake announce plan mother say write tell reckon such frail person next evening use own discretion give note enclose

I don’t know that you could do a wiser thing than go to him, for he is no more fit to tell what is good for him than a child.’ So spoke the doctor, thinking only of the patient till looking up at the pair he was dismissing to such a charge, the helpless, crippled Charles, unable to cross the room without crutches, and Amabel, her delicate face and fragile figure in her widow’s mourning, looking like a thing to be pitied and nursed with the tenderest care, with that young child, too, he broke off and said--‘But you don’t mean you are in earnest?’",say only chance say doctor look latter spirit health react other see plain work parliament do moderation go gloomy old place dreaming go right way work attack brain do know do wise thing go fit tell good child speak doctor think patient look pair dismiss charge helpless crippled unable cross room crutch delicate face fragile figure widow mourn look thing pity nurse tenderest care young child break say mean earnest

72," Just as the last hues of sunset were fading, on the following evening, Lady Morville and Charles Edmonstone were passing from the moor into the wooded valley of Redclyffe. Since leaving Moorworth not a word had passed. Charles sat earnestly watching his sister; though there was too much crape in the way for him to see her face, and she was perfectly still, so that all he could judge by was the close, rigid clasping together of the hands, resting on the sleeping infant’s white mantle. Each spot recalled to him some description of Guy’s, the church-tower, the school with the two large new windows, the park wall, the rising ground within. What was she feeling? He did not dare to address her, till, at the lodge-gate, he exclaimed--‘There’s Markham;’ and, at the same time, was conscious of a feeling between hope and fear, that this might after all be a fool’s errand, and a wonder how they and the master of the house would meet if it turned out that they had taken fright without cause.",last hue sunset fade follow evening pass moor wooded valley leave word pass sit watch sister be much crape way see face judge close rigid clasping hand rest sleeping infant white mantle spot recall description church tower school large new window park wall rise ground feel dare address lodge gate exclaim be same time conscious feeling hope fear fool errand wonder master house meet turn take fright cause

But she was eagerly asking Markham how Philip should be informed of their arrival, and Markham was looking perplexed, and saying, that to drive under the gateway, into the paved court, would make a thundering sound, that he dreaded for Mr. Morville. Could Mr. Charles Edmonstone cross the court on foot? Charles was ready to do so; the carriage stopped, Amabel gave the baby to Anne, saw Arnaud help Charles out; and turning to Markham, said, ‘I had better go to him at once.

The full brightness of lamp and fire showed the ashy paleness of his face; his hair, rumpled with lying on the sofa, had, on the temples, acquired a noticeable tint of gray, his whole countenance bore traces of terrible suffering; and Amabel thought that even at Recoara she had never seen him look more wretchedly ill.",come say intent hospitality hasten hall meet door give arm conduct invite light guide sitting room full brightness lamp fire show ashy paleness face hair rumple lie sofa temple acquire noticeable tint gray whole countenance bear trace terrible suffering think see look ill

That he, with Amy and her child, should be in Guy’s home, so differently from their old plans, so very differently from the way she should have arrived. He looked round the room, and everywhere knew what Guy’s taste had prepared for his bride--piano, books, prints, similarities to Hollywell, all with a fresh new bridal effect, inexpressibly melancholy. They brought a thought of the bright eye, sweet voice, light step, and merry whistle; and as he said to himself ‘gone for ever,’ he could have hated Philip, but for the sight of his haggard features, gray hairs, and the deep lines which, at seven-and-twenty, sorrow had traced on his brow.

She knew it was the room he had destined for her; she tried, dark as it was, to see the view of which he had told her, and looked up, over the mantel-piece, at Muller’s engraving of St. John. Perhaps that was the hardest time of all her trial, and she felt as if, without his child in her arms, she could never have held up under the sense of desolation that came over her, left behind, while he was in his true home. Left, she told herself, to finish the task he had begun, and to become fit to follow him. Was she not in the midst of fulfilling his last charge, that Philip should be taken, care of? It was no time for giving way, and here was his own little messenger of comfort looking up with her sleepy eyes to tell her so. Down she must go, and put off ‘thinking herself into happiness’ till the peaceful time of rest; and presently she softly re-entered the sitting-room, bringing to both its inmates in her very presence such solace as she little guessed, in her straightforward desire to nurse Philip, and take care Charles was not made uncomfortable.",more say return make stay stair talk bewilder surprise joy grief look see comfortable room make arrangement child last relieve short space calm feel realize whisper little girl father own home know room destine try dark see view tell look mantel piece engraving hard time trial feel child arm hold sense desolation come leave true home left tell finish task begin become fit follow midst fulfil last charge take care time give way own little messenger comfort look sleepy eye tell go put think happiness peaceful time rest re-enter sitting room bring inmate very presence such solace little guess straightforward desire nurse take care make uncomfortable

And now he was lying among those southern mountains, and she stood in the spot where he had loved to think of seeing her; and with Philip by her side. His sea, his own dear sea, the vision of which had cheered, his last day, like the face of a dear old friend; his sea, rippling and glancing on, unknowing that the eyes that had loved it so well would gaze on it no more; the wind that he had longed for to cool his fevered brow, the rock which had been like a playmate in his boyhood, and where he had perilled his life, and rescued so many. It was one of the seasons when a whole gush of fresh perceptions of his feelings, like a new meeting with himself, would come on her, her best of joys; and there she stood, gazing fixedly, her black veil fluttering in the wind, and her hands pressed close together, till Philip, little knowing what the sight was to her, shivered, saying it was very cold and windy, and without hesitation she turned away, feeling that now Redclyffe was precious indeed.",lay guy own wave lift crest breaking surge resounding sea bird skimm dark rugged scene seem centre home affection long show cost effort death bed resign hope leaping wave say change white head mountain lie southern mountain stand spot love think see side sea own dear sea vision cheer last day face dear old friend sea ripple glance unknow eye love gaze wind long cool fevered brow rock playmate boyhood perill life rescue many season whole gush fresh perception feeling new meeting come good joy stand gaze black veil flutter wind hand press little know sight shiver say cold windy hesitation turn feel precious

His back was towards them, so that he was unconscious of their approach, and they saw how he spoke to Anne, looked fixedly at the child, made her laugh, and finally took her in his arms, as he had so often carried her father, studying earnestly her little face. As soon as he saw them coming, he hastily gave her back to Anne, as if ashamed to be thus caught, but he was obliged to grunt and put his hand up to his shaggy eyelashes, before he could answer Amabel’s greeting.",leave long shelter sunny wall come sight meeting baby take air arm hover day anxious know matter go back unconscious approach see speak look child make laugh take arm carry father study little face see come give ashamed catch oblige grunt put hand shaggy eyelashe answer greeting

From writing a few lines in Amabel’s daily letter to Laura, he proceeded to filling the envelope, and from being put to sleep by Charles’s reading, to reading aloud the whole evening himself. The pony carriage was set up, and he drove Charles out every day, Amabel being then released from attending him, and free to enjoy herself in her own way in rambles about the house and park, and discoveries of the old haunts she knew so well by description.",day refreshment ensue one day become strong resume more usual habit write few line daily letter proceed fill envelope put sleep reading read whole evening pony carriage set drive day release attend free enjoy own way ramble house park discovery old haunt know description

One day, when alone in the sitting-room, she thought of trying the piano he had chosen for her. It was locked, but the key was on her own split-ring, where he had put it for her the day he returned from London. She opened it, and it so happened, that the first note she struck reminded her of one of the peculiarly sweet and deep tones of Guy’s voice. It was like awaking its echo again, and as it died away, she hid her face and wept. But from that time the first thing she did when her brother and cousin were out, was always to bring down her little girl, and play to her, watching how she enjoyed the music.",find way own room walk child arm talk hold admire treasure boyhood delight keep order day alone sitting room think try piano choose lock key own split ring put day return open happen first note strike remind sweet deep tone voice awake echo die hide face goot time first thing do brother cousin bring little girl play watch enjoy music

Amabel herself was no longer drooping and pining, her step grew light and elastic, a shade of pink returned to her cheek, and the length of walk she could take was wonderful, considering her weakness in the summer. Every day she stood on the cliff and looked at ‘Guy’s sea,’ before setting out to visit the cottages, and hear the fond rough recollections of Sir Guy, or to wander far away into the woods or on the moor, and find the way to the places he had loved. One day, when Philip and Charles came in from a drive, they overtook her in the court, her cloak over her arm, her crape limp with spray, her cheeks brightened to a rosy glow by the wind, and a real smile as she looked up to them. When Charles was on his sofa, she stooped over him and whispered, ‘James and Ben Robinson have taken me out to the Shag!’",little prosper sea air gain colour take spring laugh intelligent lively way look bring more likeness father droop pine step grow light elastic shade pink return cheek length walk take wonderful consider weakness summer day stand cliff look sea set visit cottage hear fond rough recollection wander wood moor find way place love day come drive overtake court cloak arm crape limp spray cheek brighten rosy glow wind real smile look sofa stoop whisper take

She delighted in visits to the cottages, and Charles every day wondered where was the drooping dejection that she could not shake off at home. She would have said that in Guy’s own home, ‘the joy’ had come to her, no longer in fitful gleams and held by an effort for a moment, but steadily brightening. She missed him indeed, but the power of finding rest in looking forward to meeting him, the pleasure of dwelling on the days he had been with her, and the satisfaction of doing his work for the present, had made a happiness for her, and still in him, quiet, grave, and subdued, but happiness likely to bloom more and more brightly throughout her life.

Philip was a good deal overwhelmed at first by the quantity of business on his hands, and setting about it while his head was still weak, would have seriously hurt himself again, if Charles had not come to his help, worked with a thorough good will, great clearness and acuteness, and surprised Philip by his cleverness and perseverance. He was elated at being of so much use; and begged to be considered for the future as Philip’s private secretary, to which the only objection was, that his handwriting was as bad as Philip’s was good; but it was an arrangement so much to the benefit of both parties, that it was gladly made. Philip was very grateful for such valuable assistance; and Charles amused himself with triumphing in his importance, when he should sit in state on his sofa at Hollywell, surrounded with blue-books, getting up the statistics for some magnificent speech of the honourable member for Moorworth.",proceed anxious comfort other good deal overwhelm first quantity business hand set head weak hurt come help work thorough good will great clearness acuteness surprise cleverness perseverance elate much use begg consider future private secretary only objection handwriting bad good arrangement much benefit party make grateful such valuable assistance amuse triumph importance sit state sofa surround blue book get statistic magnificent speech honourable member

Charles, with a little exaggeration, professed that he had never been so flattered in his whole life, as he was by the compliments that reflected on him as the future brother-in-law of Philip; and that he had really begun to think even Laura not half sensible enough of her own happiness. Lady Thorndale afterwards proceeded to inquiries about the De Courcy family, especially Lady Eveleen; and Charles, enlightened by Charlotte, took delight in giving a brilliant description of his cousin’s charms, for which he was rewarded by very plain intimations of the purpose for which her son James was gone to Kilcoran.",find home hear grounds go look leave sofa ladyship care little exaggeration profess flatter whole life compliment reflect future brother law begin think sensible enough own happiness proceed inquiry family enlighten take delight give brilliant description cousin charm reward plain intimation purpose son go

She little knows what she has thrown away!’ Letters from Kilcoran became rare; Laura scarcely wrote at all to Philip, and though Mrs. Edmonstone wrote as usual, she did not notice the subject; while Charlotte’s gravity and constraint, when she did achieve a letter to Charles, were in such contrast to her usual free and would-be satirical style, that such eyes as her brother’s could hardly fail to see that something was on her mind.",anxious further intelligence receive have letter friend only comment deep sigh poor little know throw letter become rare write write usual notice subject gravity constraint achieve letter such contrast usual free satirical style such eye brother fail see mind

188,"‘My Dearest Amy,--You will be extremely surprised at what I have to tell you, and no less grieved. It has been a most unpleasant, disgraceful business from beginning to end, and the only comfort in it to us is the great discretion and firmness that Charlotte has shown. I had better, however, begin at the beginning, and tell you the history as far as I understand it myself. You know that Mr. James Thorndale has been here, and perhaps you know it was for the purpose of making an offer to Eveleen. Every one was much surprised at her refusing him, and still more when, after much prevarication, it came out that the true motive was her attachment to Mr. Fielder, the tutor. It appeared that they had been secretly engaged for some weeks, ever since they had perceived Mr. Thorndale’s intentions, and not, as it was in poor Laura’s case, an unavowed attachment, but an absolute engagement. And fancy Eva justifying it by Laura’s example! There was of course great anger and confusion. Lord Kilcoran was furious, poor Lady Kilcoran had nervous attacks, the gentleman was dismissed from the house, and supposed to be gone to England, Eva shed abundance of tears, but after a great deal of vehemence she appeared subdued and submissive. We were all very sorry for her, as there is much that is very agreeable and likely to attract her in Mr. Fielder, and she always had too much mind to be wasted in such a life as she leads here. It seemed as if Laura was a comfort to her, and Lady Kilcoran was very anxious we should stay as long as possible. This was all about three weeks or a month ago; Eva was recovering her spirits, and I was just beginning a letter to tell you we hoped to be at home in another week, when Charlotte came into my room in great distress to tell me that Eveleen and Mr. Fielder were on the verge of a run-away marriage. Charlotte had been coming back alone from a visit to grandmamma, and going down a path out of the direct way to recall Bustle, who had run on, she said, as if he scented mischief, came, to her great astonishment, on Eveleen walking arm-in-arm with Mr. Fielder! Charlie will fancy how Charlotte looked at them! They shuffled, and tried to explain it away, but Charlotte was too acute for them, or rather, she held steadily to “be that as it may, Lord Kilcoran ought to know it.” They tried to frighten her with the horrors of betraying secrets, but she said none had been confided to her, and mamma would judge. They tried to persuade her it was the way of all lovers, and appealed to Laura s example, but there little Charlotte was less to be shaken than on any point. “I did not think them worthy to hear their names,” she said to me, “but I told them, that I had seen that the truest and deepest of love had a horror of all that was like wrong, and as to Philip and Laura, they little knew what they had suffered; besides, theirs was not half so bad.” I verily believe these were the very words she used to them. At last Eva threw herself on her mercy, and begged so vehemently that she would only wait another day, that she suspected, and, with sharpness very like Charlie’s, forced from Eva that they were to marry the next morning. Then she said it would be a great deal better that they should abuse her and call her a spy than do what they would repent of all their lives; she begged Eva’s pardon, and cried so much that Eva was in hopes she would relent, and then came straight to me, very unhappy, and not in the least triumphant in her discovery. You can guess what a dreadful afternoon we had, I don’t think any one was more miserable than poor Charlotte, who stayed shut up in my room all day, dreading the sight of any one, and expecting to be universally called a traitor. The end was, that after much storming, Lord Kilcoran, finding Eveleen determined, and anxious to save her the discredit of an elopement, has agreed to receive Mr. Fielder, and they are to be married from this house on the 6th of December, though what they are to live upon no one can guess. The Kilcorans are very anxious to put the best face on the matter possible, and have persuaded us, for the sake of the family, to stay for the wedding; indeed, poor Lady Kilcoran is so completely overcome, that I hardly like to leave her till this is over. How unpleasant the state of things in the house is no one can imagine, and very, very glad shall I be to get back to Hollywell and my Amy and Charlie.

Mrs. Edmonstone had nearly the whole correspondence of the family on her hands; for neither of her daughters liked to write, and she gave the description of the various uncomfortable scenes that took place. Lord de Courcy’s stern and enduring displeasure, and his father’s fast subsiding violence; Lady Kilcoran’s distress, and the younger girls’ excitement and amusement; but she said she thought the very proper and serious way in which Charlotte viewed it, would keep it from doing them much harm, provided, as was much to be feared, Lord Kilcoran did not end by keeping the pair always at home, living upon him till Mr. Fielder could get a situation. In fact, it was difficult to know what other means there were of providing for them.",have much peace write go like return meet condolence have whole correspondence family hand daughter like write give description various uncomfortable scene take place stern endure displeasure father fast subside violence distress young girl excitement amusement say think proper serious way view keep do much harm provide much fear end keep pair home live get situation fact difficult know other means be provide

Amabel had talked of her sister to Mrs. Ashford, and done much to smooth the way; and even on the last day or two, held a few consultations with Philip, as to the arrangements that Laura would like.

In a few moments more, Amabel had run up-stairs, and brought down Mr. Shene’s portrait. There was proved to be more resemblance than either of them had at first sight credited. The form of the forehead, nose, and short upper lip were identical, so were the sharply-defined black eyebrows, the colour of the eyes; and the way of standing in both had a curious similarity; but the expression was so entirely different, that strict comparison alone proved, that Guy’s animated, contemplative, and most winning countenance, was in its original lineaments entirely the same with that of his ancestor. Although Sir Hugh’s was then far from unprepossessing, and bore as yet no trace of his unholy passions, it bought to Amabel’s mind the shudder with which Guy had mentioned his likeness to that picture, and seemed to show her the nature he had tamed.",stand gaze countenance recall plead desist wilfulness bending sickness expression fiery youth few moment run stair bring portrait prove more resemblance have first sight credit form forehead nose short upper lip identical define black eyebrow colour eye way stand have curious similarity expression different strict comparison prove animated contemplative win countenance original lineament same ancestor unprepossess bear trace unholy passion buy mind shudder mention likeness picture seem show nature tame

She was the only silent one of the party that evening, as they gathered round the dinner or tea-table, or sat divided into threes or pairs, talking over the subjects that would not do to be discussed in public. Charlotte generally niched into Amy’s old corner by Charles, hearing about Redclyffe, or telling about Ireland. Mrs. Edmonstone and Amy on the opposite sides of the ottoman, their heads meeting over the central cushion, talking in low, fond, inaudible tones; Mr. Edmonstone going in and out of the room, and joining himself to one or other group, telling and hearing news, and sometimes breaking up the pairs; and then Mrs. Edmonstone came to congratulate Charles on Amy’s improved looks, or Charlotte pressed up close to Amy to tell her about grandmamma. For Charlotte could not talk about Eveleen, she had been so uncomfortable at the part she had had to act, that all the commendation she received was only like pain and shame, and her mother was by no means dissatisfied that it should be so, since a degree of forwardness had been her chief cause of anxiety in Charlotte; and it now appeared that without losing her high spirit and uncompromising sense of right, her sixteenth year was bringing with it feminine reserve.",one look happy have wear fade harass aspect cheer presence seem shrink speak only silent one party evening gather dinner tea- table sit divide three pair talk subject do discuss public nich old corner hear tell opposite side ottoman head meet central cushion talk low fond inaudible tone go room join other group tell hear news break pair come congratulate improve look press tell grandmamma talk uncomfortable part have act commendation receive pain shame mother means dissatisfied degree forwardness chief cause anxiety appear lose high spirit uncompromising sense right sixteenth year bring feminine reserve
