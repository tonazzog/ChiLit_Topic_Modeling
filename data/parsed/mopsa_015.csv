4," Mopsa woke: she was rather too big to be nursed, for she was the size of Jack, and looked like a sweet little girl of ten years, but she did not always behave like one; sometimes she spoke as wisely as a grown-up woman, and sometimes she changed again and seemed like a child.",wake big nurse size look sweet little girl year behave speak grow woman change seem child 
5,"Mopsa lifted up her head and pushed back her long hair: her coronet had fallen off while she was in the bed of reeds; and she said to the beautiful dame,--",lift head push long hair coronet fall bed reed say beautiful dame

11,"As she spoke, the sweet, clear bell of the castle sounded three times, and then chimes began to play: they played such a joyous tune that it made everybody sing. The dame sang, the crowd of fairies sang, the boy who was Jack's double sang, and Mopsa sang,--only Jack was silent,--and this was the song:--",speak sweet clear bell castle sound time chime begin play play joyous tune make sing dame sing crowd fairy sing boy double sing sing silent song

14,"""We shall see about that!"" thought Jack to himself. And Mopsa, while she sang those last words, burst into tears, which Jack did not like to see; but all the fairies were so very glad, so joyous, and so delighted with her for having come to be their queen, that after a while she dried her eyes, and said to the wrong boy,--",see think sing last word burst tear like see fairy glad joyous delighted come queen while dry eye say wrong boy

24,"""The sun came shining in as I stepped inside,"" said Mopsa, ""and a long beam fell down from the fairy dome across my feet. Do you remember what the apple-woman told us,--how it was reported that the brown doe and her nation had a queen whom they shut up, and never let the sun shine on her? That was not a kind or true report, and yet it came from something that really happened.""",sun come shine step say long beam fall fairy dome foot remember apple woman tell report brown doe nation have queen shut let sun shine kind true report come happen

26,"""I dare not tell you all that story yet,"" said Mopsa; ""but, Jack, as the brown doe and all the fawns came up to greet me, and passed by turns into the sunbeam, they took their own forms, every one of them, because the spell was broken. They were to remain in the disguise of deer till a queen of alien birth should come to them against her will.

30,"""Because he is the heir, of course,"" answered Mopsa.",heir course answer 
31,"""But I don't see that this is any reason at all,"" said Jack.",see reason say 
32,"Mopsa laughed. ""That's because you don't know how to argue,"" she replied. ""Why, the thing is as plain as possible.""",laugh know argue reply thing plain possible 
33,"""It may be plain to you,"" persisted Jack, ""but it's no reason.""",plain persist reason 
34,"""No reason!"" repeated Mopsa, ""no reason! when I like you the best of anything in the world, and when I am come here to be queen? Of course, when the spell was broken he took exactly your form on that account; and very right too.""",reason repeat reason like good world come queen course spell break take form account right 
35,"""But why?"" asked Jack.",ask 
36,"Mopsa, however, was like other fairies in this respect,--that she knew all about Old Mother Fate, but not about causes and reasons. She believed, as we do in this world, that",other fairy respect know old cause reason believe do world 
37,"  That that is, is;",
38,but the fairies go further than this; they say:--,fairy go say

40,"This sounds like nonsense to us, but it is all right to them.",sound nonsense right 
41,"So Mopsa, thinking she had explained everything, said again,--",think explain say 
42,"""And, dear Jack, will you give the silver fourpence to me?""",dear give silver fourpence 
43,"Jack took it out; and she got down from the dame's knee and took it in the palm of her hand, laying the other palm upon it.",take get dame knee take palm hand lay other palm 
44,"""It will be very hot,"" observed the dame.",hot observe dame 
45,"""But it will not burn me so as really to hurt, if I am a real queen,"" said Mopsa.",burn hurt real queen say

48,"""Never mind, sweet Queen,"" he answered; ""it will not hurt you long. Remember my poor uncle and all his knights.""",mind sweet answer hurt remember poor uncle knight 
49,"Mopsa still held the little silver coin; but Jack saw that it hurt her, for two bright tears fell from her eyes; and in another moment he saw that it was actually melted, for it fell in glittering drops from Mopsa's hand to the marble floor, and there it lay as soft as quicksilver.",hold little silver coin see hurt bright tear fall eye moment see melt fall glittering drop hand marble floor lay soft quicksilver 
50,"""Pick it up,"" said Mopsa to the other Jack; and he instantly did so, and laid it in her hand again; and she began gently to roll it backwards and forwards between her palms till she had rolled it into a very slender rod, two feet long, and not nearly so thick as a pin; but it did not bend, and it shone so brightly that you could hardly look at it.",pick say other do lay hand begin roll forward palm roll slender rod foot long thick pin bend shine look 
51,"Then she held it out towards the real Jack, and said, ""Give this a name.""",hold real say give name 
52,"""I think it is a----"" began the other Jack; but the dame suddenly stopped him. ""Silence, sire! Don't you know that what it is first called that it will be?""",think begin other dame stop silence sire know call 
53,Jack hesitated; he thought if Mopsa was a queen the thing ought to be a sceptre; but it certainly was not at all like a sceptre.,hesitate think queen thing sceptre sceptre 
54,"""That thing is a wand,"" said he.",thing wand say 
55,"""You are a wand,"" said Mopsa, speaking to the silver stick, which was glittering now in a sunbeam almost as if it were a beam of light itself. Then she spoke again to Jack:",wand say speak silver stick glitter sunbeam beam light speak 
56,"""Tell me, Jack, what can I do with a wand?""",tell do wand 
57,"Again the boy-king began to speak, and the dame stopped him, and again Jack considered. He had heard a great deal in his own country about fairy wands, but he could not remember that the fairies had done anything particular with them, so he gave what he thought was true, but what seemed to him a very stupid answer:",boy king begin speak dame stop consider hear great deal own country fairy wand remember fairy do particular give think true seem stupid answer 
58,"""You can make it point to anything that you please.""",make point 
59,"The moment he had said this, shouts of ecstasy filled the hall, and all the fairies clapped their hands with such hurrahs of delight that he blushed for joy.",moment say shout ecstasy fill hall fairy clapp hand such hurrah delight blush joy 
60,"The dame also looked truly glad, and as for the other Jack, he actually turned head over heels, just as Jack had often done himself on his father's lawn.",dame look glad other turn head heel do father lawn 
61,"Jack had merely meant that Mopsa could point with the wand to anything that she saw; but he was presently told that what he had meant was nothing, and that his words were everything.",mean point wand see tell mean word 
62,"""I can make it point now,"" said Mopsa, ""and it will point aright to anything I please, whether I know where the thing is or not.""",make point say point know thing

64,"Then Mopsa rose and walked towards the beautiful staircase, the dame and all the fairies following. Jack was going too, but the other Jack held him.",rise walk beautiful staircase dame fairy follow go other hold 
65,"""Where is Mopsa going? and why am I not to follow?"" inquired Jack.",go follow inquire 
66,"""They are going to put on her robes, of course,"" answered the other Jack.",go put robe course answer other 
67,"""I am so tired of always hearing you say 'of course,'"" answered Jack; ""and I wonder how it is that you always seem to know what is going to be done without being told. However, I suppose you can't help being odd people.""",tired hear say course answer wonder seem know go do tell suppose help odd person 
68,"The boy-king did not make a direct answer; he only said, ""I like you very much, though you don't like me.""",boy king make direct answer say like like 
69,"""Why do you like me?"" asked Jack.",like ask 
70,"So he opened his eyes wide with surprise: ""Most boys say Sire to me,"" he observed; ""at least they used to do when there were any boys here. However, that does not signify. Why, of course I like you, because I am so tired of being always a fawn, and you brought Mopsa to break the spell. You cannot think how disagreeable it is to have no hands, and to be all covered with hair. Now look at my hands; I can move them and turn them everywhere, even over my head if I like. Hoofs are good for nothing in comparison; and we could not talk.""",open eye surprise most boy say sire observe least use do be boy signify course like tired fawn bring break spell think disagreeable have hand cover hair look hand move turn head like hoof good comparison talk 
71,"""Do tell me about it,"" said Jack. ""How did you become fawns?""",tell say become fawn 
72,"""I dare not tell you,"" said the boy; ""and listen!--I hear Mopsa.""",tell say boy listen hear 
73,"Jack looked, and certainly Mopsa was coming, but very strangely, he thought. Mopsa, like all other fairies, was afraid to whisper a spell with her eyes open; so a handkerchief was tied across them, and as she came on she felt her way, holding by the banisters with one hand, and with the other, between her finger and thumb, holding out the silver wand. She felt with her foot for the edge of the first stair; and Jack heard her say, ""I am much older,--ah! so much older, now I have got my wand. I can feel sorrow too, and _their_ sorrow weighs down my heart.""",look come think other fairy afraid whisper spell eye open handkerchief tie come feel way hold banister hand other finger thumb hold silver wand feel foot edge first stair hear say old old get wand feel sorrow sorrow weigh heart 
74,"Mopsa was dressed superbly in a white satin gown, with a long, long train of crimson velvet which was glittering with diamonds; it reached almost from one end of the great gallery to the other, and had hundreds of fairies to hold it and keep it in its place. But in her hair were no jewels, only a little crown made of daisies, and on her shoulders her robe was fastened with the little golden image of a boat. These things were to show the land she had come from and the vessel she had come in.",dress white satin gown long long train crimson velvet glitter diamond reach end great gallery other have hundred fairy hold keep place hair jewel little crown make daisy shoulder robe fasten little golden image boat thing show land come vessel come 
75,"So she came slowly, slowly down stairs blindfold, and muttering to her wand all the time:",come stair blindfold mutter wand time 
76,"  Though the sun shine brightly,   Wand, wand, guide rightly.",sun shine wand guide 
77,"So she felt her way down to the great hall. There the wand turned half round in the hall toward the great door, and she and Jack and the other Jack came out into the lawn in front with all the followers and trainbearers; only the dame remained behind.",feel way great hall wand turn half hall great door other come lawn front follower trainbearer dame remain 
78,"Jack noticed now for the first time that, with the one exception of the boy-king, all these fairies were lady-fairies; he also observed that Mopsa, after the manner of fairy queens, though she moved slowly and blindfold, was beginning to tell a story. This time it did not make him feel sleepy. It did not begin at the beginning: their stories never do.",notice first time exception boy king fairy lady fairy observe manner fairy queen move blindfold begin tell story time make feel sleepy begin beginning story do 
79,"These are the first words he heard, for she spoke softly and very low, while he walked at her right hand, and the other Jack on her left:",first word hear speak low walk right hand other left 
80,"""And so now I have no wings. But my thoughts can go up (Jovinian and Roxaletta could not think). My thoughts are instead of wings; but they have dropped with me now, as a lark among the clods of the valley. Wand, do you bend? Yes, I am following, wand.",have wing thought go think thought wing drop lark clod valley wand bend follow wand 
81,"""And after that the bird said, 'I will come when you call me.' I never have seen her moving overhead; perhaps she is out of sight.

There are zones, but those in the lowest zone are far out of sight.",bird say come call see move overhead sight flock bird hover world watch air thin be zone low zone sight

84,"""And so that woman told me,--(Wand, you bend again, and I will turn at your bending),--that woman told me how it was: for when the new king was born, a black fairy with a smiling face came and sat within the doorway. She had a spindle, and would always spin. She wanted to teach them how to spin, but they did not like her, and they loved to do nothing at all. So they turned her out.",woman tell wand bend turn bending woman tell new king bear black fairy smile face come sit doorway have spindle spin want teach spin like love do turn 
85,"""But after her came a brown fairy, with a grave face, and she sat on the black fairy's stool and gave them much counsel. They liked that still less; so they got spindles and spun, for they said, 'She will go now, and we shall have the black fairy again.' When she did not go they turned her out also, and after her came a white fairy, and sat in the same seat. She did nothing at all, and she said nothing at all; but she had a sorrowful face, and she looked up. So they were displeased. They turned her out also; and she went and sat by the edge of the lake with her two sisters.",come brown fairy grave face sit black fairy stool give much counsel like less get spindle spun say go have black fairy go turn come white fairy sit same seat do say have sorrowful face look displease turn go sit edge lake sister 
86,"""And everything prospered over all the land; till, after shearing-time, the shepherds, because the king was a child, came to his uncle and said, 'Sir, what shall we do with the old wool, for the new fleeces are in the bales, and there is no storehouse to put them in?' So he said, 'Throw them into the lake.'",prosper land shearing time shepherd king child come uncle say do old wool new fleece bale be storehouse put say throw lake

90,"""So the finches flew away.",finch fly

92,"""He said, 'Throw that into the lake also.'",say throw lake 
93,"""While they were throwing it in, there came a great flight of the wood fairies, fairies of passage from over the sea. They were in the form of pigeons, and they alighted and prayed them, 'O, cousins! we are faint with our long flight; give us some of that corn which you do not want, that we may peck it and be refreshed.'",throw come great flight wood fairy fairy passage sea form pigeon alight pray cousin faint long flight give corn want peck refresh

95,"""Then the brown fairy said, 'They may be forgiven this once, but yet it is a great unkindness.'",brown fairy say forgive great unkindness 
96,"""And as they were going to pour in the last sackful, there passed a poor mortal beggar, who had strayed in from the men and women's world, and she said, 'Pray give me some of that wheat, O fairy people! for I am hungry. I have lost my way, and there is no money to be earned here. Give me some of that wheat, that I may bake cakes, lest I and my baby should starve.'",go pour last sackful pass poor mortal beggar stray man woman world say pray give wheat fairy person hungry lose way be money earn give wheat bake cake baby starve

98,"""So they poured it all into the lake; and then the white fairy said, 'This cannot be forgiven them'; and she covered her face with her hands and wept. Then the black fairy rose and drove them all before her,--the prince, with his chief shepherd and his reapers, his courtiers and his knights; she drove them into the great bed of reeds, and no one has ever set eyes on them since. Then the brown fairy went into the palace where the king's aunt sat, with all her ladies and her maids about her, and with the child-king on her knee.",pour lake white fairy say forgive cover face hand goot black fairy rise drive prince chief shepherd reaper courtier knight drive great bed reed set eye brown fairy go palace king aunt sit lady maid child king knee

And all that day it was dark and gloomy, and nothing happened, and all the next day it rained and rained; and they thrust the dame into a dark closet, and kept her there for a whole month, and still not a ray of sunshine came to do them any damage; but the dame faded and faded in the dark, and at last they said, 'She must come out, or she will die; and we do not believe the sun will ever shine in our country any more.' So they let the poor dame come out; and lo! as she crept slowly forth under the dome, a piercing ray of sunlight darted down upon her head, and in an instant they were all changed into deer, and the child-king too.",speak creep corner cover dame head veil day dark gloomy happen next day rain rain thrust dame dark closet keep whole month ray sunshine come do damage dame fade fade dark last say come die believe sun shine country more let poor dame come creep dome pierce ray sunlight dart head instant change deer child king

104,"Now while Mopsa told her story the wand continued to bend, and Mopsa, following, was slowly approaching the foot of a great precipice, which rose sheer up for more than a hundred feet.

106,"They told her, and she called to some of her ladies to untie the handkerchief. Then Mopsa looked at the rock, and so did the two Jacks. There was nothing to be seen but a very tiny hole. The boy-king thought it led to a bees' nest, and Jack thought it was a keyhole, for he noticed in the rock a slight crack which took the shape of an arched door.",tell call lady untie handkerchief look rock do be see tiny hole boy king think lead bee nest think keyhole notice rock slight crack take shape arched door
