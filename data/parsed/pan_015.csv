1,CHAPTER 15. “HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”,hook time 
2,"Odd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our noticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t know how long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.",odd thing happen way life notice time happen take instance discover deaf ear know hour experience come night last see steal island finger lip dagger ready see crocodile pass notice peculiar remember tick first think eerie conclude clock run 
3,"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.",give thought feeling fellow creature deprive close companion begin consider turn catastrophe own use decide tick wild beast believe crocodile let pass unmolested tick unforeseen result crocodile hear sound follow purpose regain lose friend belief tick know slave fix idea stupid beast 
4,"Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs encountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this time.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.",reach shore mishap go leg encounter water unaware enter new element many animal pass land water other human know swim have thought hook time tick go ticking know do know stop board brig help tick ingenious idea occur 
5,"On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.",contrary think scal side noiseless mouse amaze see pirate cower midst abject hear crocodile 
6,"The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of me!”  he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.",crocodile remember hear ticking think sound come crocodile look realise do flash understand situation clever think sign boy burst applause 
7,"It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the forecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by your watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence.

8,“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.),begin count 
9,"None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which showed them that the more terrible sound had passed.",inch tiptoe vanish cabin more pirate screw courage look hear other distressed breathing show terrible sound pass 
10,"“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s still again.”",gone captain say wipe spectacle 
11,"Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.",let head emerge ruff listen catch echo tick be sound draw full height 
12,"“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous ditty:",cry hate boy more see unbend break villainous ditty

14,"To terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when he finished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat [o’ nine tails] before you walk the plank?”",terrorize prisoner more certain loss dignity dance imaginary plank grimace sing finish cry want touch cat tail walk plank

17,The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.,cabin cabin child gaze other 
18,"“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They followed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song, his dogs joining in with him:",say strode cabin follow eye know resume song dog join

20,"What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.",last line know sudden song stay dreadful screech cabin wail ship die hear crow sound understand boy pirate eerie screech 
21,“What was that?” cried Hook.,cry hook 
22,"“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.",say

26,“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.,dead cry startle pirate

28,"The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seen by Hook.",exultation boy lower look pirate see

30,"Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No, no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.",bravest brave cower captain cry purr claw 
31,"“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.",say go say 
32,"Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more singing, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow.",go fling arm be more singing listen come death screech crow

39,"“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again he had the support of the crew.",swing go reply have support crew

42,"“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.",shake hand say proffer claw 
43,"Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea.",look help desert back advance red spark eye despair scream pirate leapt long precipitate sea 
44,"“Four,” said Slightly.",say 
45,"“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”  Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.",hook say other gentleman say mutiny seize lantern raise claw menace gesture bring doodle doo say spe cabin 
46,"“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.",long say wett lip ready come staggering lantern

48,“Something!” echoed Mullins.,echoe 
49,“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.,demand 
50,"“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.",dead say hook 
51,"His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s accurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”",reluctance return cabin impress mutinous sound break pirate superstitious cry say sure sign ship accurst be board more account 
52,"“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?”",hear mutter board pirate craft last have tail captain 
53,"“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he comes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”",say say look come likeness wickedest man 
54,"“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after another took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.",have hook captain ask take cry ship doom child resist raise cheer have nigh forget prisoner swing face light 
55,"“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none the worse.”",lad cry crew notion open cabin door drive let fight doodle doo life kill good kill bad 
56,"For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door was closed on them.",last time dog admire do bid boy pretend struggle push cabin door close 
57,"“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast. It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for the reappearance of Peter.",listen cry listen dare face door time bind mast scream crow watch reappearance 
58,"She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this time.”  So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.",have long wait cabin find thing go search key free child manacle steal armed such weapon find sign hide cut bond easy fly thing barr way oath hook time free whisper conceal other take place mast cloak pass take great breath crow 
59,"To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.",pirate voice cry boy lay slain cabin panic stricken hook try heart dog make show fang know take eye leap 
60,"“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never quailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”",lad say ready cajole strike need quail instant think be

63,"Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s worth trying,” they said doubtfully.",remember saying worth try say 
64,"“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the figure in the cloak.",fling girl cry make rush figure cloak

66,"“There’s one,” replied the figure.",be reply figure 
67,“Who’s that?”,
68,"“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke Peter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ‘twas that had been undoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed. In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.",avenger come terrible answer speak flung cloak know twa undoing cabin essay speak fail frightful moment think fierce heart break 
69,"At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.",last cry cleave brisket conviction 
70,"“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking wildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man they were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven eight--nine--ten--eleven.",boy voice ring moment clash arm resounding ship pirate keep certain win onset come unstrung run strike think last survivor crew man man strong fight defensive enable boy hunt pair choose quarry miscreant leapt sea other hide dark recesse find fight run lantern flash face half blind fall easy prey reek sword other boy be little sound hear clang weapon occasional screech splash count 
71,"I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.",think gone group savage boy surround seem have charm life keep bay circle fire do dog man seem match close hew clear space lift boy hook use buckler shield pass sword spring fray

73,Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew back and formed a ring around them.,find face face other draw form ring 
74,"For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.",enemy look shudder strange smile face 
75,"“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”",pan say hook last do

77,"“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”",proud insolent youth say prepare meet doom 
78,"“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”",dark sinister man answer have 
79,"Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s hand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.",more word fall space be advantage blade superb swordsman parry dazzling rapidity anon follow feint lunge get foe defence short reach stand ill stead drive steel home hook inferior brilliancy nimble wrist play force weight onset hope end favourite thrust teach astonishment find thrust turn seek close give quietus iron hook time paw air double lung pierce rib sight own blood peculiar colour remember offensive sword fall hand mercy 
80,"“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.",cry boy magnificent gesture invite opponent pick sword hook tragic feeling show good form

83,"“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.”",youth joy answer venture little bird break egg 
84,"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.",course nonsense proof unhappy hook know least very pinnacle good form 
85,"“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.",cry 
86,"He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.",fight human flail sweep terrible sword sever man boy obstruct flutter very wind make blow danger zone dart prick 
87,Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever.,fight hope passionate breast ask life boon crave see show bad form cold 
88,Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.,abandon fight rush powder magazine fire

92,"What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster] for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his socks were right.",sort form show misguid man glad sympathise end true tradition race other boy fly flout scornful stagger deck strike mind slouch playing field send headmaster good watch wall game famous wall shoe right waistcoat right tie right sock right

95,"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.",see advance air dagger poise spring bulwark cast sea know crocodile wait stop clock knowledge spare little mark respect end 
96,"He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.",have last triumph think grudge stand bulwark look shoulder glide air invite gesture use foot make kick stab

99,Thus perished James Hook.,perish 
100,"“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his figures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.",sing correct figure pay penalty crime night reach shore capture redskin make nurse papoose melancholy come pirate wander world spectacle make precarious living say only man hook fear 
101,"Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”",course stand take part fight watch glisten eye become prominent praise shudder show place kill take cabin point watch hang nail say half past one 
102,"The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.",lateness hour big thing get bed pirate bunk sure strut deck last fall asleep side long have dream night cry sleep long time hold
