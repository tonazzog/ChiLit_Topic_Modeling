1,CHAPTER IX. THE MAN WITH THE BELT OF GOLD,chapter man belt gold 
2,"More than a week went by, in which the ill-luck that had hitherto pursued the Covenant upon this voyage grew yet more strongly marked. Some days she made a little way; others, she was driven actually back. At last we were beaten so far to the south that we tossed and tacked to and fro the whole of the ninth day, within sight of Cape Wrath and the wild, rocky coast on either hand of it. There followed on that a council of the officers, and some decision which I did not rightly understand, seeing only the result: that we had made a fair wind of a foul one and were running south.",more week go ill luck pursue voyage grow mark day make little way other drive last beat south toss tack whole ninth day sight wild rocky coast hand follow council officer decision understand see result make fair wind foul one run 
3,"The tenth afternoon there was a falling swell and a thick, wet, white fog that hid one end of the brig from the other. All afternoon, when I went on deck, I saw men and officers listening hard over the bulwarks--“for breakers,” they said; and though I did not so much as understand the word, I felt danger in the air, and was excited.",tenth afternoon be falling swell thick wet white fog hide end brig other afternoon go deck see man officer listen bulwark breaker say understand word feel danger air excited 
4,"Maybe about ten at night, I was serving Mr. Riach and the captain at their supper, when the ship struck something with a great sound, and we heard voices singing out. My two masters leaped to their feet.",night serve captain supper ship strike great sound hear voice sing master leap foot 
5,“She’s struck!” said Mr. Riach.,strike say 
6,"“No, sir,” said the captain. “We’ve only run a boat down.”",sir say captain run boat 
7,And they hurried out.,hurry 
8,"The captain was in the right of it. We had run down a boat in the fog, and she had parted in the midst and gone to the bottom with all her crew but one. This man (as I heard afterwards) had been sitting in the stern as a passenger, while the rest were on the benches rowing. At the moment of the blow, the stern had been thrown into the air, and the man (having his hands free, and for all he was encumbered with a frieze overcoat that came below his knees) had leaped up and caught hold of the brig’s bowsprit. It showed he had luck and much agility and unusual strength, that he should have thus saved himself from such a pass. And yet, when the captain brought him into the round-house, and I set eyes on him for the first time, he looked as cool as I did.",captain right run boat fog part midst go bottom crew man hear sit stern passenger rest bench row moment blow stern throw air man have hand free encumber frieze overcoat come knee leap catch hold brig bowsprit show have luck much agility unusual strength save pass captain bring round house set eye first time look cool 
9,"He was smallish in stature, but well set and as nimble as a goat; his face was of a good open expression, but sunburnt very dark, and heavily freckled and pitted with the small-pox; his eyes were unusually light and had a kind of dancing madness in them, that was both engaging and alarming; and when he took off his great-coat, he laid a pair of fine silver-mounted pistols on the table, and I saw that he was belted with a great sword. His manners, besides, were elegant, and he pledged the captain handsomely. Altogether I thought of him, at the first sight, that here was a man I would rather call my friend than my enemy.",smallish stature set nimble goat face good open expression sunburnt dark freckle pit small pox eye light have kind dancing madness engaging alarming take great coat lay pair fine silver mount pistol table see belt great sword manners elegant pledge captain think first sight man call friend enemy 
10,"The captain, too, was taking his observations, but rather of the man’s clothes than his person. And to be sure, as soon as he had taken off the great-coat, he showed forth mighty fine for the round-house of a merchant brig: having a hat with feathers, a red waistcoat, breeches of black plush, and a blue coat with silver buttons and handsome silver lace; costly clothes, though somewhat spoiled with the fog and being slept in.",captain take observation man clothes person sure take great coat show fine round house merchant brig have hat feather red waistcoat breeche black plush blue coat silver button handsome silver lace costly clothes spoiled fog sleep

13,“Friends of yours?” said Hoseason.,friend say 
14,"“You have none such friends in your country,” was the reply. “They would have died for me like dogs.”",have such friend country reply die dog 
15,"“Well, sir,” said the captain, still watching him, “there are more men in the world than boats to put them in.”",sir say captain watch be more man world boat put 
16,"“And that’s true, too,” cried the other, “and ye seem to be a gentleman of great penetration.”",true cry other seem gentleman great penetration

20,"“Oho!” says the stranger, “is that how the wind sets?” And he laid his hand quickly on his pistols.",say stranger wind set lay hand pistol 
21,"“Don’t be hasty,” said the captain. “Don’t do a mischief before ye see the need of it. Ye’ve a French soldier’s coat upon your back and a Scotch tongue in your head, to be sure; but so has many an honest fellow in these days, and I dare say none the worse of it.”",hasty say captain do mischief see need have french soldier coat back tongue head sure have many honest fellow day say bad 
22,"“So?” said the gentleman in the fine coat: “are ye of the honest party?”  (meaning, Was he a Jacobite? for each side, in these sort of civil broils, takes the name of honesty for its own).",say gentleman fine coat honest party meaning side sort civil broil take name honesty own 
23,"“Why, sir,” replied the captain, “I am a true-blue Protestant, and I thank God for it.” (It was the first word of any religion I had ever heard from him, but I learnt afterwards he was a great church-goer while on shore.) “But, for all that,” says he, “I can be sorry to see another man with his back to the wall.”",sir reply captain true blue thank first word religion hear learn great church goer shore say sorry see man back wall 
24,"“Can ye so, indeed?” asked the Jacobite. “Well, sir, to be quite plain with ye, I am one of those honest gentlemen that were in trouble about the years forty-five and six; and (to be still quite plain with ye) if I got into the hands of any of the red-coated gentry, it’s like it would go hard with me. Now, sir, I was for France; and there was a French ship cruising here to pick me up; but she gave us the go-by in the fog--as I wish from the heart that ye had done yoursel’! And the best that I can say is this: If ye can set me ashore where I was going, I have that upon me will reward you highly for your trouble.”",ask sir plain honest gentleman trouble year plain get hand red coat gentry go sir be french ship cruise pick give go fog wish heart do yoursel good say set go have reward trouble

26,"And then, unhappily, he observed me standing in my corner, and packed me off to the galley to get supper for the gentleman. I lost no time, I promise you; and when I came back into the round-house, I found the gentleman had taken a money-belt from about his waist, and poured out a guinea or two upon the table. The captain was looking at the guineas, and then at the belt, and then at the gentleman’s face; and I thought he seemed excited.",observe stand corner pack galley get supper gentleman lose time promise come round house find gentleman take money belt waist pour guinea table captain look guinea belt gentleman face think seem excited 
27,"“Half of it,” he cried, “and I’m your man!”",half cry man 
28,"The other swept back the guineas into the belt, and put it on again under his waistcoat. “I have told ye sir,” said he, “that not one doit of it belongs to me. It belongs to my chieftain,” and here he touched his hat, “and while I would be but a silly messenger to grudge some of it that the rest might come safe, I should show myself a hound indeed if I bought my own carcase any too dear. Thirty guineas on the sea-side, or sixty if ye set me on the Linnhe Loch. Take it, if ye will; if not, ye can do your worst.”",other sweep guinea belt put waistcoat tell sir say doit belong belong chieftain touch hat silly messenger grudge rest come safe show hound buy own carcase dear guinea sea side set take do bad 
29,"“Ay,” said Hoseason. “And if I give ye over to the soldiers?”",say give soldier 
30,"“Ye would make a fool’s bargain,” said the other. “My chief, let me tell you, sir, is forfeited, like every honest man in Scotland. His estate is in the hands of the man they call King George; and it is his officers that collect the rents, or try to collect them. But for the honour of Scotland, the poor tenant bodies take a thought upon their chief lying in exile; and this money is a part of that very rent for which King George is looking. Now, sir, ye seem to me to be a man that understands things: bring this money within the reach of Government, and how much of it’ll come to you?”",make fool bargain say other chief let tell sir forfeit honest man estate hand man call officer collect rent try collect honour poor tenant body take thought chief lying exile money part very rent look sir seem man understand thing bring money reach government much come

32,"“Ah, but I’ll begowk* ye there!” cried the gentleman. “Play me false, and I’ll play you cunning. If a hand is laid upon me, they shall ken what money it is.”",begikd cry gentleman play false play cunn hand lay ke money

36,"And thereupon the captain went out (rather hurriedly, I thought), and left me alone in the round-house with the stranger.",captain go think leave round house stranger 
37,"At that period (so soon after the forty-five) there were many exiled gentlemen coming back at the peril of their lives, either to see their friends or to collect a little money; and as for the Highland chiefs that had been forfeited, it was a common matter of talk how their tenants would stint themselves to send them money, and their clansmen outface the soldiery to get it in, and run the gauntlet of our great navy to carry it across. All this I had, of course, heard tell of; and now I had a man under my eyes whose life was forfeit on all these counts and upon one more, for he was not only a rebel and a smuggler of rents, but had taken service with King Louis of France. And as if all this were not enough, he had a belt full of golden guineas round his loins. Whatever my opinions, I could not look on such a man without a lively interest.",period be many exiled gentleman come peril life see friend collect little money chief forfeit common matter talk tenant stint send money clansmen outface soldiery get run gauntlet great navy carry have course hear tell have man eye life forfeit count more rebel smuggler rent take service enough have belt full golden guinea loin opinion look man lively interest

42,"“And that’s naething,” said he. “But I’m saying, Mr. Betwixt-and-Between,” he added, “this bottle of yours is dry; and it’s hard if I’m to pay sixty guineas and be grudged a dram upon the back of it.”",naeth say say add bottle dry hard pay guinea grudge dram back

44,"The fog was as close as ever, but the swell almost down. They had laid the brig to, not knowing precisely where they were, and the wind (what little there was of it) not serving well for their true course. Some of the hands were still hearkening for breakers; but the captain and the two officers were in the waist with their heads together. It struck me (I don’t know why) that they were after no good; and the first word I heard, as I drew softly near, more than confirmed me.",fog close swell lay brig know wind little be serve true course hand hearken breaker captain officer waist head strike know good first word hear draw more confirm

55,"I had never been so be-Davided since I came on board: but I said Yes, as if all I heard were quite natural.",come board say hear natural 
56,"“The trouble is,” resumed the captain, “that all our firelocks, great and little, are in the round-house under this man’s nose; likewise the powder. Now, if I, or one of the officers, was to go in and take them, he would fall to thinking. But a lad like you, David, might snap up a horn and a pistol or two without remark. And if ye can do it cleverly, I’ll bear it in mind when it’ll be good for you to have friends; and that’s when we come to Carolina.”",trouble resume captain firelock great little round house man nose powder officer go take fall think lad snap horn pistol remark do bear mind good have friend come

59,"I told him I would do as he wished, though indeed I had scarce breath to speak with; and upon that he gave me the key of the spirit locker, and I began to go slowly back to the round-house. What was I to do? They were dogs and thieves; they had stolen me from my own country; they had killed poor Ransome; and was I to hold the candle to another murder? But then, upon the other hand, there was the fear of death very plain before me; for what could a boy and a man, if they were as brave as lions, against a whole ship’s company?",tell do wish have scarce breath speak give key spirit locker begin go round house do dog thief steal own country kill poor hold candle murder other hand be fear death plain boy man brave lion whole ship company 
60,"I was still arguing it back and forth, and getting no great clearness, when I came into the round-house and saw the Jacobite eating his supper under the lamp; and at that my mind was made up all in a moment. I have no credit by it; it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion, that I walked right up to the table and put my hand on his shoulder.",argue get great clearness come round house see eat supper lamp mind make moment have credit choice compulsion walk table put hand shoulder

70,"The round-house was built very strong, to support the breaching of the seas. Of its five apertures, only the skylight and the two doors were large enough for the passage of a man. The doors, besides, could be drawn close: they were of stout oak, and ran in grooves, and were fitted with hooks to keep them either shut or open, as the need arose. The one that was already shut I secured in this fashion; but when I was proceeding to slide to the other, Alan stopped me.",round house build strong support breaching sea aperture skylight door large passage man door draw stout oak run groove fit hook keep shut open need arise one shut secure fashion proceed slide other stop

74,"Then he gave me from the rack a cutlass (of which there were a few besides the firearms), choosing it with great care, shaking his head and saying he had never in all his life seen poorer weapons; and next he set me down to the table with a powder-horn, a bag of bullets and all the pistols, which he bade me charge.",give rack cutlass be few firearm choose great care shake head say life see poorer weapon set table powder horn bag bullet pistol bid charge

79,"I told him I would listen closely. My chest was tight, my mouth dry, the light dark to my eyes; the thought of the numbers that were soon to leap in upon us kept my heart in a flutter: and the sea, which I heard washing round the brig, and where I thought my dead body would be cast ere morning, ran in my mind strangely.",tell listen chest tight mouth dry light dark eye thought number leap keep heart flutter sea hear wash brig think dead body cast morning run mind
