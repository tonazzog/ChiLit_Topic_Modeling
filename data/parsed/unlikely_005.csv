3,"“I’ve seen too much trouble come of christening parties,” said he. “However carefully you keep your visiting-book, some fairy or other is sure to get left out, and you know what _that_ leads to. Why, even in my own family, the most shocking things have occurred. The Fairy Malevola was not asked to my great-grandmother’s christening—and you know all about the spindle and the hundred years’ sleep.”",see much trouble come christening party say keep visit book fairy other sure leave know lead own family shocking thing occur ask great grandmother christening know spindle year sleep 
4,"“Perhaps you’re right,” said the Queen. “My own cousin by marriage forgot some stuffy old fairy or other when she was sending out the cards for her daughter’s christening, and the old wretch turned up at the last moment, and the girl drops toads out of her mouth to this day.”",right say own cousin marriage forget stuffy old fairy other send card daughter christening old wretch turn last moment girl drop toad mouth day 
5,"“Just so. And then there was that business of the mouse and the kitchen-maids,” said the King; “we’ll have no nonsense about it. I’ll be her godfather, and you shall be her godmother, and we won’t ask a single fairy; then none of them can be offended.”",be business mouse kitchen maid say have nonsense godfather godmother ask single fairy offend 
6,"“Unless they all are,” said the Queen.",say 
7,"And that was exactly what happened. When the King and the Queen and the baby got back from the christening the parlourmaid met them at the door, and said—",happen baby get christening parlourmaid meet door say

11,"There were about seven hundred. The great Throne Room was crammed with fairies, of all ages and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness—good fairies and bad fairies, flower fairies and moon fairies, fairies like spiders and fairies like butterflies—and as the Queen opened the door and began to say how sorry she was to have kept them waiting, they all cried, with one voice, “Why didn’t you ask _me_ to your christening party?”",be great cramm fairy age degree beauty ugliness good fairy bad fairy flower fairy moon fairy fairy spider fairy butterfly open door begin say sorry keep wait cry voice ask christening party

16,"“Don’t begin to make excuses,” she said, shaking her finger at the Queen. “That only makes your conduct worse. You know well enough what happens if a fairy is left out of a christening party. We are all going to give our christening presents _now_. As the fairy of highest social position, I shall begin. The Princess shall be bald.”",begin make excuse say shake finger make conduct bad know happen fairy leave christening party go give christening present _now_ fairy high social position begin bald 
17,"The Queen nearly fainted as Malevola drew back, and another fairy, in a smart bonnet with snakes in it, stepped forward with a rustle of bats’ wings. But the King stepped forward too.",faint draw fairy smart bonnet snake step rustle bat wing step 
18,"“No you don’t!” said he. “I wonder at you, ladies, I do indeed. How can you be so unfairylike? Have none of you been to school—have none of you studied the history of your own race? Surely you don’t need a poor, ignorant King like me to tell you that this is _no go_?”",say wonder lady unfairylike school have study history own race need poor ignorant tell go_

20,The King actually put his hand over her mouth.,put hand mouth 
21,"“Look here,” he said; “I won’t have it. Listen to reason—or you’ll be sorry afterwards. A fairy who breaks the traditions of fairy history goes out—you know she does—like the flame of a candle. And all tradition shows that only _one_ bad fairy is ever forgotten at a christening party and the good ones are always invited; so either this is not a christening party, or else you were all invited except one, and, by her own showing, that was Malevola. It nearly always is. Do I make myself clear?”",look say have listen reason sorry fairy break tradition fairy history go know flame candle tradition show _one_ bad fairy forget christening party good one invite christening party else invite own show make clear 
22,Several of the better-class fairies who had been led away by Malevola’s influence murmured that there was something in what His Majesty said.,several good class fairy lead influence murmure be say

24,"No one answered, and presently several fairies came up to the Queen and said what a pleasant party it had been, but they really must be going. This example decided the rest. One by one all the fairies said goodbye and thanked the Queen for the delightful afternoon they had spent with her.",answer several fairy come say pleasant party go example decide rest fairy say goodbye thank delightful afternoon spend 
25,"“It’s been quite too lovely,” said the lady with the snake-bonnet; “_do_ ask us again soon, dear Queen. I shall be so _longing_ to see you again, and the _dear_ baby,” and off she went, with the snake-trimming quivering more than ever.",lovely say lady snake bonnet ask dear _longing_ see _dear_ baby go snake trimming quiver more

For all the baby’s downy golden hair came off with the cap, and the Princess Melisande was as bald as an egg.",very last fairy go run look baby tore lace cap burst tear baby downy golden hair come cap bald egg

30,"“Oh, won’t you wish for it _now_?” said the Queen, dropping mixed tears and kisses on the baby’s round, smooth head.",wish say drop mix tear kisse baby round smooth head 
31,"“No, dearest. She may want something else more when she grows up. And besides, her hair may grow by itself.”",dearest want else more grow hair grow 
32,"But it never did. Princess Melisande grew up as beautiful as the sun and as good as gold, but never a hair grew on that little head of hers. The Queen sewed her little caps of green silk, and the Princess’s pink and white face looked out of these like a flower peeping out of its bud. And every day as she grew older she grew dearer, and as she grew dearer she grew better, and as she grew more good she grew more beautiful.",grow beautiful sun good gold hair grow little head sew little cap green silk pink white face look flower peep bud day grow old grow dearer grow dearer grow good grow good grow beautiful 
33,"Now, when she was grown up the Queen said to the King—",grow say 
34,"“My love, our dear daughter is old enough to know what she wants. Let her have the wish.”",love dear daughter old know want let have wish 
35,So the King wrote to his fairy godmother and sent the letter by a butterfly. He asked if he might hand on to his daughter the wish the fairy had given him for a wedding present.,write fairy godmother send letter butterfly ask hand daughter wish fairy give wedding present 
36,"“I have never had occasion to use it,” said he, “though it has always made me happy to remember that I had such a thing in the house. The wish is as good as new, and my daughter is now of an age to appreciate so valuable a present.”",have occasion use say make happy remember have thing house wish good new daughter age appreciate valuable present 
37,To which the fairy replied by return of butterfly:—,fairy reply return butterfly

40,"So the King unlocked his gold safe with the seven diamond-handled keys that hung at his girdle, and took out the wish and gave it to his daughter.",unlock gold safe diamond handle key hang girdle take wish give daughter 
41,"And Melisande said: “Father, I will wish that all your subjects should be quite happy.”",say father wish subject happy 
42,"But they were that already, because the King and Queen were so good. So the wish did not go off.",good wish go 
43,So then she said: “Then I wish them all to be good.”,say wish good 
44,"But they were that already, because they were happy. So again the wish hung fire.",happy wish hang fire 
45,"Then the Queen said: “Dearest, for my sake, wish what I tell you.”",say dearest sake wish tell 
46,"“Why, of course I will,” said Melisande. The Queen whispered in her ear, and Melisande nodded. Then she said, aloud—",course say whisper ear nod say 
47,"“I wish I had golden hair a yard long, and that it would grow an inch every day, and grow twice as fast every time it was cut, and——”",wish have golden hair yard grow inch day grow time cut 
48,"“Stop,” cried the King. And the wish went off, and the next moment the Princess stood smiling at him through a shower of golden hair.",stop cry wish go next moment stand smile shower golden hair

50,“What was the end?” asked the King.,end ask 
51,"“Oh,” said Melisande, “I was only going to say, ‘and twice as thick.’”",say go say thick 
52,"“It’s a very good thing you didn’t,” said the King. “You’ve done about enough.” For he had a mathematical mind, and could do the sums about the grains of wheat on the chess-board, and the nails in the horse’s shoes, in his Royal head without any trouble at all.",good thing say do enough have mathematical mind do sum grain wheat chess board nail horse shoe royal head trouble 
53,"“Why, what’s the matter?” asked the Queen.",matter ask 
54,"“You’ll know soon enough,” said the King. “Come, let’s be happy while we may. Give me a kiss, little Melisande, and then go to nurse and ask her to teach you how to comb your hair.”",know say come let happy give kiss little go nurse ask teach comb hair 
55,"“I know,” said Melisande, “I’ve often combed mother’s.”",know say comb mother 
56,"“Your mother has beautiful hair,” said the King; “but I fancy you will find your own less easy to manage.”",mother have beautiful hair say fancy find own easy manage 
57,"And, indeed, it was so. The Princess’s hair began by being a yard long, and it grew an inch every night. If you know anything at all about the simplest sums you will see that in about five weeks her hair was about two yards long. This is a very inconvenient length. It trails on the floor and sweeps up all the dust, and though in palaces, of course, it is all gold-dust, still it is not nice to have it in your hair. And the Princess’s hair was growing an inch every night. When it was three yards long the Princess could not bear it any longer—it was so heavy and so hot—so she borrowed nurse’s cutting-out scissors and cut it all off, and then for a few hours she was comfortable. But the hair went on growing, and now it grew twice as fast as before; so that in thirty-six days it was as long as ever. The poor Princess cried with tiredness; when she couldn’t bear it any more she cut her hair and was comfortable for a very little time. For the hair now grew four times as fast as at first, and in eighteen days it was as long as before, and she had to have it cut. Then it grew eight inches a day, and the next time it was cut it grew sixteen inches a day, and then thirty-two inches and sixty-four inches and a hundred and twenty-eight inches a day, and so on, growing twice as fast after each cutting, till the Princess would go to bed at night with her hair clipped short, and wake up in the morning with yards and yards and yards of golden hair flowing all about the room, so that she could not move without pulling her own hair, and nurse had to come and cut the hair off before she could get out of bed.",hair begin yard long grow inch night know simple sum see week hair yard long inconvenient length trail floor sweep dust palace course gold dust nice have hair hair grow inch night yard bear heavy hot borrow nurse cut scissors cut few hour comfortable hair go grow grow day poor cry tiredness bear more cut hair comfortable little time hair grow time first day have have cut grow inch day next time cut grow inch day inch inch inch day grow cutting go bed night hair clippe short wake morning yard yard yard golden hair flow room move pull own hair nurse have come cut hair get bed 
58,"“I wish I was bald again,” sighed poor Melisande, looking at the little green caps she used to wear, and she cried herself to sleep o’ nights between the golden billows of the golden hair. But she never let her mother see her cry, because it was the Queen’s fault, and Melisande did not want to seem to reproach her.",wish bald sigh poor look little green cap use wear cry sleep night golden billow golden hair let mother see cry fault want seem reproach 
59,"When first the Princess’s hair grew her mother sent locks of it to all her Royal relations, who had them set in rings and brooches. Later, the Queen was able to send enough for bracelets and girdles. But presently so much hair was cut off that they had to burn it. Then when autumn came all the crops failed; it seemed as though all the gold of harvest had gone into the Princess’s hair. And there was a famine. Then Melisande said—",hair grow mother send lock royal relation have set ring brooche able send enough bracelet girdle much hair cut have burn autumn come crop fail seem gold harvest go hair be famine say 
60,"“It seems a pity to waste all my hair; it does grow so very fast. Couldn’t we stuff things with it, or something, and sell them, to feed the people?”",seem pity waste hair grow stuff thing sell feed person 
61,"So the King called a council of merchants, and they sent out samples of the Princess’s hair, and soon orders came pouring in; and the Princess’s hair became the staple export of that country. They stuffed pillows with it, and they stuffed beds with it. They made ropes of it for sailors to use, and curtains for hanging in Kings’ palaces. They made haircloth of it, for hermits, and other people who wished to be uncomfy. But it was so soft and silky that it only made them happy and warm, which they did not wish to be. So the hermits gave up wearing it, and, instead, mothers bought it for their little babies, and all well-born infants wore little shirts of Princess-haircloth.",call council merchant send sample hair order come pour hair become staple export country stuff pillow stuff bed make rope sailor use curtain hang palace make haircloth hermit other person wish uncomfy soft silky make happy warm wish hermit give wear mother buy little baby bear infant wear little shirt haircloth 
62,And still the hair grew and grew. And the people were fed and the famine came to an end.,hair grow grow person feed famine come end 
63,Then the King said: “It was all very well while the famine lasted—but now I shall write to my fairy godmother and see if something cannot be done.”,say famine last write fairy godmother see do 
64,"So he wrote and sent the letter by a skylark, and by return of bird came this answer—",write send letter skylark return bird come answer 
65,“Why not advertise for a competent Prince? Offer the usual reward.”,advertise competent offer usual reward 
66,So the King sent out his heralds all over the world to proclaim that any respectable Prince with proper references should marry the Princess Melisande if he could stop her hair growing.,send herald world proclaim respectable proper reference marry stop hair grow 
67,"Then from far and near came trains of Princes anxious to try their luck, and they brought all sorts of nasty things with them in bottles and round wooden boxes. The Princess tried all the remedies, but she did not like any of them, and she did not like any of the Princes, so in her heart she was rather glad that none of the nasty things in bottles and boxes made the least difference to her hair.",come train prince anxious try luck bring sort nasty thing bottle round wooden box try remedy like like heart glad nasty thing bottle box make least difference hair

69,"The Princess had to sleep in the great Throne Room now, because no other room was big enough to hold her and her hair. When she woke in the morning the long high room would be quite full of her golden hair, packed tight and thick like wool in a barn. And every night when she had had the hair cut close to her head she would sit in her green silk gown by the window and cry, and kiss the little green caps she used to wear, and wish herself bald again.",have sleep great other room big hold hair wake morning long high room full golden hair pack tight thick wool barn night have hair cut close head sit green silk gown window cry kiss little green cap use wear wish 
70,It was as she sat crying there on Midsummer Eve that she first saw Prince Florizel.,sit cry see 
71,"He had come to the palace that evening, but he would not appear in her presence with the dust of travel on him, and she had retired with her hair borne by twenty pages before he had bathed and changed his garments and entered the reception-room.",come palace evening appear presence dust travel retire hair borne page bath change garment enter reception room 
72,"Now he was walking in the garden in the moonlight, and he looked up and she looked down, and for the first time Melisande, looking on a Prince, wished that he might have the power to stop her hair from growing. As for the Prince, he wished many things, and the first was granted him. For he said—",walk garden moonlight look look first time look wish have power stop hair grow wish many thing first grant say

82,"“Dear Princess,” said he, “your father’s promise is nothing to me. I want yours. Will you give it to me?”",dear say father promise want give

94,"“Now,” said he, when he had given them back to her, “to-night do not go to bed. Stay by your window, and I will stay down here in the garden and watch. And when your hair has grown to the filling of your room call to me, and then do as I tell you.”",say give night go bed stay window stay garden watch hair grow fill room call do tell 
95,"“I will,” said the Princess.",say

101,“Jump!”,jump 
102,"The Princess jumped, and screamed, for there she was hanging from the hook by a yard and a half of her bright hair; the Prince tightened his grasp of the hair and drew his sword across it.",jump scream hang hook yard half bright hair tighten grasp hair draw sword

104,They stayed talking in the garden till all the shadows had crept under their proper trees and the sun-dial said it was breakfast time.,stay talk garden shadow creep proper tree sun-dial say breakfast time

106,"“How did you do it?” asked the King, shaking Florizel warmly by the hand.",do ask shake hand 
107,"“The simplest thing in the world,” said Florizel, modestly. “You have always cut the hair off the Princess. _I_ just cut the Princess off the hair.”",simple thing world say cut hair cut hair 
108,"“Humph!” said the King, who had a logical mind. And during breakfast he more than once looked anxiously at his daughter. When they got up from breakfast the Princess rose with the rest, but she rose and rose and rose, till it seemed as though there would never be an end of it. The Princess was nine feet high.",say have logical mind breakfast more look daughter get breakfast rise rest rise rise rise seem be end foot high 
109,"“I feared as much,” said the King, sadly. “I wonder what will be the rate of progression. You see,” he said to poor Florizel, “when we cut the hair off _it_ grows—when we cut the Princess off _she_ grows. I wish you had happened to think of that!”",fear much say wonder rate progression see say poor cut hair grow cut grow wish happen think 
110,"The Princess went on growing. By dinner-time she was so large that she had to have her dinner brought out into the garden because she was too large to get indoors. But she was too unhappy to be able to eat anything. And she cried so much that there was quite a pool in the garden, and several pages were nearly drowned. So she remembered her “Alice in Wonderland,” and stopped crying at once. But she did not stop growing. She grew bigger and bigger and bigger, till she had to go outside the palace gardens and sit on the common, and even that was too small to hold her comfortably, for every hour she grew twice as much as she had done the hour before. And nobody knew what to do, nor where the Princess was to sleep. Fortunately, her clothes had grown with her, or she would have been very cold indeed, and now she sat on the common in her green gown, embroidered with gold, looking like a great hill covered with gorse in flower.",go grow dinner time large have have dinner bring garden large get unhappy able eat cry be pool garden several page drown remember stop cry stop grow grow big big big have go palace garden sit common small hold hour grow much do hour know do sleep clothes grow cold sit common green gown embroider gold look great hill cover gorse flower

112,"The King did not weep or look on. He sat down at once and wrote to his fairy godmother, asking her advice.

Left no address.”",weep look sit write fairy godmother ask advice send weasel letter return weasel get own letter mark gone left address 
113,"It was now, when the kingdom was plunged into gloom, that a neighbouring King took it into his head to send an invading army against the island where Melisande lived. They came in ships and they landed in great numbers, and Melisande looking down from her height saw alien soldiers marching on the sacred soil of her country.",kingdom plunge gloom neighbour take head send invade army island live come ship land great number look height see alien soldier march sacred soil country

119,"Melisande could easily have sunk them all with one kick, but she did not like to do this because it might have drowned the sailors, and besides, it might have swamped the island.",sink kick like do drown sailor swamp island 
120,"So she simply stooped and picked the island as you would pick a mushroom—for, of course, all islands are supported by a stalk underneath—and carried it away to another part of the world. So that when the warships got to where the island was marked on the map they found nothing but sea, and a very rough sea it was, because the Princess had churned it all up with her ankles as she walked away through it with the island.",stoop pick island pick mushroom course island support stalk carry part world warship get island mark map find sea rough sea churn ankle walk island 
121,"When Melisande reached a suitable place, very sunny and warm, and with no sharks in the water, she set down the island; and the people made it fast with anchors, and then every one went to bed, thanking the kind fate which had sent them so great a Princess to help them in their need, and calling her the saviour of her country and the bulwark of the nation.",reach suitable place sunny warm shark water set island person make anchor one go bed thank kind fate send great help need call saviour country bulwark nation

And when it was dark the Princess came close to the island, and looked down, from far up, at her palace and her tower and cried, and cried, and cried. It does not matter how much you cry into the sea, it hardly makes any difference, however large you may be. Then when everything was quite dark the Princess looked up at the stars.",poor work nation bulwark country saviour mile high have talk want humble right size marry sweetheart dark come island look palace tower cry cry cry matter much cry sea make difference large dark look star

125,“Cut off your hair!” it said.,cut hair say 
126,"Now, everything the Princess was wearing had grown big along with her, so that now there dangled from her golden girdle a pair of scissors as big as the Malay Peninsula, together with a pin-cushion the size of the Isle of Wight, and a yard measure that would have gone round Australia.",wear grow big dangle golden girdle pair scissors big malay pin-cushion size yard measure go 
127,"And when she heard the little, little voice, she knew it, small as it was, for the dear voice of Prince Florizel, and she whipped out the scissors from her gold case and snip, snip, snipped all her hair off, and it fell into the sea. The coral insects got hold of it at once and set to work on it, and now they have made it into the biggest coral reef in the world; but that has nothing to do with the story.",hear little little voice know small dear voice whip scissors gold case snip snip snipp hair fall sea coral insect get hold set work make big coral reef world have do story
