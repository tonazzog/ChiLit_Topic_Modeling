In fact, the landlord was the party who took all the venison off their hands, and disposed of it. They drove into the yard, and, giving the pony and cart in charge of the hostler, went into the inn, where they found the landlord, and one or two other people, who were drinking.",arrive direct way small hostelry keeper verderer resort fact landlord party take venison hand dispose drive yard give pony cart charge hostler go inn find landlord other person drink

20,"Oswald and Edward then entered with the landlord, and arrangements were made between Master Andrew and the latter for a regular supply of venison during the season, at a certain price; but as it would now be dangerous to bring it into the town, it was agreed that when there was any ready, Edward should come to Lymington and give notice, and the landlord would send out people to bring it in during the night. This bargain concluded, they took a glass with the landlord, and then went into the town to make the necessary purchases. Oswald took Edward to all the shops where the articles he required were to be purchased; some they carried away with them; others, which were too heavy, they left, to be called for with the cart as they went away. Among other articles, Edward required powder and lead, and they went to a gunsmith's where it was to be procured. While making his purchases, Edward perceived a sword, which he thought he had seen before, hanging up against the wall among other weapons.",enter landlord arrangement make latter regular supply venison season certain price dangerous bring town agree be ready come give notice landlord send person bring night bargain conclude take glass landlord go town make necessary purchase take shop article require purchase carry other heavy leave call cart go other article require powder lead go gunsmith procure make purchase perceive sword think see hang wall other weapon

All the others remained fast asleep. Humphrey walked about a mile with Oswald, and was returning to the farm when he thought, as he had not examined his pitfall for many days, that he might as well look at it before he went back. He therefore struck out in the direction in which it lay, and arrived there just as the day began to dawn.",stay short time tired resolve set daylight follow morning do disturbing one dress give eat go other remain asleep walk mile return farm think examine pitfall many day look go strike direction lay arrive day begin dawn 
64,"It was the end of March, and the weather was mild for the season. Humphrey arrived at the pit, and it was sufficiently light for him to perceive that the covering had been broken in, and therefore, in all probability, something must have been trapped. He sat down and waited for daylight, but at times he thought he heard a heavy breathing, and once a low groan. This made him more anxious, and he again and again peered into the pit, but could not for a long while discover any thing, until at last he thought that he could make out a human figure lying at the bottom. Humphrey called out, asking if there was any one there. A groan was the reply, and now Humphrey was horrified with the idea that somebody had fallen into the pit, and had perished, or was perishing for want of succor. Recollecting that the rough ladder which he had made to take the soil up out of the pit was against an oak-tree, close at hand, he ran for it, and put it down the pit, and then cautiously descended. On his arrival at the bottom, his fears were found to be verified, for he saw the body of a lad, half clothed, lying there. He turned it up as it was lying with its face to the ground, and attempted to remove it, and to ascertain if there was life in it, which he was delighted to find was the case. The lad groaned several times, and opened his eyes. Humphrey was afraid that he was not strong enough to lift him on his shoulders and carry him up the ladder; but, on making the attempt he found out, from exhaustion, the poor lad was light enough for him to carry him, which he did, and safely landed him by the side of the pit.",end weather mild season arrive pit light perceive covering break probability trap sit wait daylight time think hear heavy breathing low groan make anxious peer pit long while discover thing last think make human figure lie bottom call ask be one groan reply horrify idea fall pit perish perish want succor recollect rough ladder make take soil pit oak tree close hand run put pit descend arrival bottom fear find verify see body lad half cloth lie turn lie face ground attempt remove ascertain be life delighted find case lad groan several time open eye afraid strong lift shoulder carry ladder make attempt find exhaustion poor lad light carry do land side pit 
65,"Recollecting that the watering-place of the herd of cattle was not far off, Humphrey then hastened to it, and filled his hat half full of water. The lad, although he could not speak, drank eagerly, and in a few minutes appeared much recovered. Humphrey gave him some more, and bathed his face and temples. The sun had now risen, and it was broad daylight. The lad attempted to speak, but what he did say was in so low a tone, and evidently in a foreign language, that Humphrey could not make him out. He, therefore, made signs to the lad that he was going away, and would be back soon; and having, as he thought, made the lad comprehend this, Humphrey ran away to the cottage as fast as he could; and as soon as he arrived he called for Edward, who came out, and when Humphrey told him in few words what had happened, Edward went into the cottage again for some milk and some cake, while Humphrey put the pony into the cart.",recollect water place herd cattle hasten fill hat half full water lad speak drink few minute appear recover give more bath face temple sun rise broad daylight lad attempt speak say low tone foreign language make make sign lad go think make lad comprehend run cottage arrive call come tell few word happen go cottage milk cake put pony cart

As soon as it was ready, they gave it to the boy, who then fell back on the bed with exhaustion, and was soon in a sound sleep. He slept soundly all that night; and the next morning, when he awoke, he appeared much better, although very hungry.

In reply to the question as to whether he would like to remain with them, and work with them on the farm, he replied that he should like it very much if they would be kind to him, and not make him work too hard; that he would cook the dinner, and catch them rabbits and birds, and make a great many things.",company several other race go sea coast usual migration pitch tent pitfall night go set snare rabbit go tent dark fall hole remain day night vain attempt get mother party gipsie belong have father know follow gang say go sea coast use look care much leave treat reply question like remain work farm reply like kind make work cook dinner catch rabbit bird make great many thing

118,"""Humphrey,"" said Edward, ""one thing is clear--as the herd is placed at present, we must have a bull or nothing. It is impossible to get within shot of the others without passing a bull, and depend upon it, our passage will be disputed; and moreover the herd will take to flight, and we shall get nothing at all.""",say thing clear herd place present have bull impossible get shot other pass bull depend passage dispute herd take flight get

121,"They advanced gradually, hiding from tree to tree, until they were within eighty yards of one of the bulls. The animal did not perceive them, and as they were now within range, they again stepped behind the tree to consult.",advance hide tree tree yard bull animal perceive range step tree consult

123,"""Very well, do so,"" replied Edward: ""if you can manage, get to that tree with the low branches, and then perhaps you will be within shot of the white bull, which is coming down in this direction. Smoker, lie down! He can not go with you, Humphrey; it will not be safe.""",do reply manage get tree low branch shot white bull come direction smoker lie go safe 
124,"The distance of the tree which Humphrey ventured to get to was one about one hundred and fifty yards from where Edward was standing. Humphrey crawled along for some time in the fern, but at last he came to a bare spot of about ten yards wide, which they were not aware of, and where he could not be concealed. Humphrey hesitated, and at last decided upon attempting to cross it. Edward, who was one moment watching the motions of Humphrey, and at another that of the two animals nearest to them, perceived that the white bull farthest from him, but nearest to Humphrey, threw its head in the air, pawed with his foot, and then advanced with a roar to where Humphrey was on the ground, still crawling toward the tree, having passed the open spot, and being now not many yards from the tree. Perceiving the danger that his brother was in, and that, moreover, Humphrey himself was not aware of it, he hardly knew how to act. The bull was too far from him to fire at it with any chance of success; and how to let Humphrey know that the animal had discovered him and was making toward him, without calling out, he did not know. All this was the thought of a moment, and then Edward determined to fire at the bull nearest to him, which he had promised not to do till Humphrey was also ready to fire, and after firing to call to Humphrey. He therefore, for one moment, turned away from his brother, and, taking aim at the bull, fired his gun; but probably from his nerves being a little shaken at the idea of Humphrey being in danger, the wound was not mortal, and the bull galloped back to the herd, which formed a closed phalanx about a quarter of a mile distant. Edward then turned to where his brother was, and perceived that the bull had not made off with the rest of the cattle, but was within thirty yards of Humphrey, and advancing upon him, and that Humphrey was standing up beside the tree with his gun ready to file. Humphrey fired, and, as it appeared, he also missed his aim; the animal made at him; but Humphrey, with great quickness, dropped his gun, and, swinging by the lower boughs, was into the tree, and out of the bull's reach in a moment. Edward smiled when he perceived that Humphrey was safe; but still he was a prisoner, for the bull went round and round the tree roaring and looking up at Humphrey. Edward thought a minute, then loaded his gun, and ordered Smoker to run in to the bull. The dog, who had only been restrained by Edward's keeping him down at his feet, sprung forward to the attack. Edward had intended, by calling to the dog, to induce the bull to follow it till within gun-shot; but before the bull had been attacked, Edward observed that one or two more of the bulls had left the herd, and were coming at a rapid pace toward him. Under these circumstances, Edward perceived that his only chance was to climb into a tree himself, which he did, taking good care to take his gun and ammunition with him. Having safely fixed himself in a forked bough, Edward then surveyed the position of the parties. There was Humphrey in the tree, without his gun. The bull who had pursued Humphrey was now running at Smoker, who appeared to be aware that he was to decoy the bull toward Edward, for he kept retreating toward him. In the mean time, the two other bulls were quite close at hand, mingling their bellowing and roaring with the first; and one of them as near to Edward as the first bull, which was engaged with Smoker. At last, one of the advancing bulls stood still, pawing the ground as if disappointed at not finding an enemy, not forty yards from where Edward was perched. Edward took good aim, and when he fired the bull fell dead. Edward was reloading his piece when he heard a howl, and looking round, saw Smoker flying up in the air, having been tossed by the first bull; and at the same time he observed that Humphrey had descended from the tree, recovered his gun, and was now safe again upon the lower bough.",distance tree venture get yard stand crawl time fern last come bare spot yard aware conceal hesitate last decide attempt cross moment watch motion animal near perceive white bull farthest near throw head air paw foot advance roar ground crawl tree pass open spot many yard tree perceive danger brother aware know act bull fire chance success let know animal discover make call know thought moment determine fire bull near promise do ready fire fire call moment turn brother take aim bull fire gun nerve little shake idea danger wound mortal bull gallop herd form close phalanx quarter mile distant turn brother perceive bull make rest cattle yard advance stand tree gun ready file fire appear miss aim animal make great quickness drop gun swing low bough tree bull reach moment smile perceive safe prisoner bull go tree roar look think minute load gun order smoker run bull dog restrain keep foot spring attack intend call dog induce bull follow gun shot bull attack observe more bull leave herd come rapid pace circumstance perceive only chance climb tree take good care take gun ammunition fix fork bough survey position party be tree gun bull pursue run appear aware decoy bull keep retreat mean time other bull close hand mingle bellowing roar first first bull engage last advance bull stand paw ground disappoint find enemy yard perch take good aim fire bull fall dead reload piece hear howl look see smoker fly air toss first bull same time observe descend tree recover gun safe low bough 
125,"The first bull was advancing again to attack Smoker, who appeared incapable of getting away, so much was he injured by the fall, when the other bull, who apparently must have been an old antagonist of the first, roared and attacked him; and now the two boys were up in the tree, the two bulls fighting between them, and Smoker lying on the ground, panting and exhausted. As the bulls, with locked horns, were furiously pressing each other, both guns were discharged, and both animals fell. After waiting a little while to see if they rose again, or if any more of the herd came up, Edward and Humphrey descended from the trees and heartily shook hands.",first bull advance attack appear incapable get much injure fall other bull old antagonist first roar attack boy tree bull fight smoker lie ground pant exhaust bull lock horn press other gun discharge animal fall wait little while see rise more herd come descend tree shake hand
