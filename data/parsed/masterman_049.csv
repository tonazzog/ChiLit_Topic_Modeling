2,"The next morning they went with their shovels to the yam plantation, and commenced their work.  As the ground was soft and swampy, the labour was very easy.  The ditch was dug nearly a yard wide, and the earth thrown up on a bank inside.  They then went to where the large patch of prickly pears grew, and cut a quantity, which they planted on the top of the bank.  Before night, they had finished about nine or ten yards of the hedge and ditch.",next morning go shovel yam plantation commence work ground soft swampy labour easy ditch dig yard earth throw bank go large patch prickly pear grow cut quantity plant top bank night finish yard hedge ditch 
3,"""I don't think that the pigs will get over that when it is finished,"" said Ready, ""and William will be able to get on by himself when we are gone, as well as if we were with him.""",think pig get finish say ready able get gone 
4,"""I'll try if I cannot shoot a pig or two,"" said William.",try shoot pig say 
5,"""Let it be a young one, then; we must not kill the old ones.  Now I think we may as well go back.  Juno is carrying in the supper.""",let young one kill old one think go carry supper 
6,"Before Mr Seagrave and Ready started on the following morning, the latter gave William directions as to the boat.  The provisions and the knapsack having been already prepared, they took leave of Mrs Seagrave, and set off, each armed with a musket, and Ready with his axe slung over his shoulder.  They had a long walk before them, as they had first to find their way back to the house, and from thence had to walk through the wood to the cove.",ready start follow morning latter give direction boat provision knapsack prepare take leave set armed musket ready axe sling shoulder have long walk have first find way house have walk wood cove 
7,"In two hours after leaving the house they reached the spot where they had first landed.  The rocks near to it were strewed with timber and planks, which lay bleaching in the sun, or half-buried in the sand.  Mr Seagrave sat down, and sighed deeply as he said, ""Ready, the sight of these timbers, of which the good ship Pacific was built, recalls feelings which I had hoped to have dismissed from my mind; but I cannot help them rising up.  The remains of this vessel appear to me as the last link between us and the civilised world, which we have been torn from, and all my thoughts of home and country, and I may say all my longing for them, are revived as strong as ever.""",hour leave house reach spot land rock strew timber plank lay bleach sun half bury sand sit sigh say ready sight timber good ship build recall feeling hope dismiss mind help rise remains vessel appear last link civilised world tear thought home country say longing revive strong 
8,"""And very natural that they should, Mr Seagrave; I feel it also.  I am content, it is true, because I have nothing to wish or look forward to; but still I could not help thinking of poor Captain Osborn and my shipmates, as I looked upon the wreck, and wishing that I might take them by the hand again.  It is very natural that one should do so.  Why, sir, do you know that I feel unhappy even about the poor ship.  We sailors love our vessels, especially when they have good qualities, and the Pacific was as fine a vessel as ever was built.  Now, sir, I feel quite melancholy when I see her planks and timbers lying about here. But, sir, if we cannot help feeling as we do, it is our duty to check the feeling, so that it does not get the mastery over us.  We can do no more.""",natural feel content true have wish look help think poor shipmate look wreck wish take hand natural do sir know feel unhappy poor ship sailor love vessel have good quality fine vessel build sir feel melancholy see plank timber lie sir help feel do duty check feeling get mastery do more 
9,"""Very true, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, rising up; ""it is not only useless, but even sinful to indulge in them, as they only can lead to our repining at the decrees of heaven.  Let us now examine the rocks, and see if anything has been thrown up that may be of use to us.""",true ready say rise useless sinful indulge lead repining decree heaven let examine rock see throw use 
10,"They walked round, but, with the exception of spars and a barrel or two of tar, they could find nothing of value.  There was no want of staves and iron hoops of broken casks, and these, Ready observed, would make excellent palings for the garden when they had time to bring them round.",walk exception spar barrel tar find value be want stave iron hoop break cask ready observe make excellent paling garden have time bring 
11,"After they had returned, they sat down to rest themselves, and then they went to the tents in the cocoa-nut grove, in which they had collected the articles thrown up when the ship went to pieces.",return sit rest go tent cocoa nut grove collect article throw ship go piece 
12,"""Why, the pigs have been at work here!"" said Ready; ""they have contrived to open one cask of flour somehow or another; look, sir--I suppose it must have been shaky, or they could not have routed into it; the canvas is not good for much, I fear; fortunately, we have several bolts of new, which I brought on shore.  Now, sir, we will see what condition the stores are in.  All these are casks of flour, and we run no risk in opening them, and seeing if they are in good order.""",pig work say ready contrive open cask flour look sir suppose shaky rout canvas good much fear have several bolt new bring shore sir see condition store cask flour run risk open see good order 
13,"The first cask which was opened had a cake round it as hard as a board; but when it was cut through with the axe, the inside was found in a good state.",first cask open have cake board cut axe inside find good state 
14,"""That's all right, sir; and I presume the others will be the same; the salt water has got in so far and made a crust, which has preserved the rest.  But now let us go to dinner, and to work afterwards.""",right sir presume other same salt water get make crust preserve rest let go dinner work
