1,CHAPTER XI.,
2," As the Baron had said, there was more peace now that Lothaire had learnt to know that he must submit, and that no one cared for his threats of his father's or his mother's vengeance.  He was very sulky and disagreeable, and severely tried Richard's forbearance; but there were no fresh outbursts, and, on the whole, from one week to another, there might be said to be an improvement.  He could not always hold aloof from one so good-natured and good-humoured as the little Duke; and the fact of being kept in order could not but have some beneficial effect on him, after such spoiling as his had been at home.",say be more peace learn know submit care threat father mother vengeance sulky disagreeable try forbearance be fresh outburst whole week say improvement hold aloof good natured good humoured little fact keep order have beneficial effect such spoil home 
3,"Indeed, Osmond was once heard to say, it was a pity the boy was not to be a hostage for life; to which Sir Eric replied, ""So long as we have not the training of him.""",hear say pity boy hostage life reply training 
4,"Little Carloman, meanwhile, recovered from his fears of all the inmates of the Castle excepting Hardigras, at whose approach he always shrank and trembled.",little recover fear inmate except approach shrank tremble 
5,"He renewed his friendship with Osmond, no longer started at the entrance of Sir Eric, laughed at Alberic's merry ways, and liked to sit on Fru Astrida's lap, and hear her sing, though he understood not one word; but his especial love was still for his first friend, Duke Richard. Hand-in-hand they went about together, Richard sometimes lifting him up the steep steps, and, out of consideration for him, refraining from rough play; and Richard led him to join with him in those lessons that Father Lucas gave the children of the Castle, every Friday and Sunday evening in the Chapel.  The good Priest stood on the Altar steps, with the children in a half circle round him--the son and daughter of the armourer, the huntsman's little son, the young Baron de Montemar, the Duke of Normandy, and the Prince of France, all were equal there--and together they learnt, as he explained to them the things most needful to believe; and thus Carloman left off wondering why Richard thought it right to be good to his enemies; and though at first he had known less than even the little leather-coated huntsman, he seemed to take the holy lessons in faster than any of them--yes, and act on them, too.  His feeble health seemed to make him enter into their comfort and meaning more than even Richard; and Alberic and Father Lucas soon told Fru Astrida that it was a saintly-minded child.",renew friendship start entrance laugh merry way like sit lap hear sing understand word especial love first friend hand hand go lift steep step consideration refrain rough play lead join lesson give child evening good stand step child half circle son daughter armourer huntsman little son young equal learn explain thing needful believe leave wonder think right good enemy first know less little leather coat huntsman seem take holy lesson fast act feeble health seem make enter comfort meaning more tell saintly minded child 
6,"Indeed, Carloman was more disposed to thoughtfulness, because he was incapable of joining in the sports of the other boys.  A race round the court was beyond his strength, the fresh wind on the battlements made him shiver and cower, and loud shouting play was dreadful to him.  In old times, he used to cry when Lothaire told him he must have his hair cut, and be a priest; now, he only said quietly, he should like it very much, if he could be good enough.",dispose thoughtfulness incapable join sport other boy race court strength fresh wind battlement make shiver cower loud shouting play dreadful old time use cry tell have hair cut priest say like good 
7,"Fru Astrida sighed and shook her head, and feared the poor child would never grow up to be anything on this earth.  Great as had been the difference at first between him and Richard, it was now far greater. Richard was an unusually strong boy for ten years old, upright and broad-chested, and growing very fast; while Carloman seemed to dwindle, stooped forward from weakness, had thin pinched features, and sallow cheeks, looking like a plant kept in the dark.",sigh shake head fear poor child grow earth great difference first great strong boy year old upright broad chested grow seem dwindle stoop weakness have thin pinch feature sallow cheek look plant keep dark 
8,"The old Baron said that hardy, healthy habits would restore the puny children; and Lothaire improved in health, and therewith in temper; but his little brother had not strength enough to bear the seasoning.  He pined and drooped more each day; and as the autumn came on, and the wind was chilly, he grew worse, and was scarcely ever off the lap of the kind Lady Astrida.  It was not a settled sickness, but he grew weaker, and wasted away.  They made up a little couch for him by the fire, with the high settle between it and the door, to keep off the draughts; and there he used patiently to lie, hour after hour, speaking feebly, or smiling and seeming pleased, when any one of those he loved approached.  He liked Father Lucas to come and say prayers with him; and he never failed to have a glad look, when his dear little Duke came to talk to him, in his cheerful voice, about his rides and his hunting and hawking adventures. Richard's sick guest took up much of his thoughts, and he never willingly spent many hours at a distance from him, softening his step and lowering his voice, as he entered the hall, lest Carloman should be asleep.",old say hardy healthy habit restore puny child improve health temper little brother strength bear seasoning pine droop day autumn come wind chilly grow bad lap kind settle sickness grow weak waste make little couch fire high settle door keep draught use lie hour hour speak smile seem pleased one love approach like come say prayer fail have glad look dear little come talk cheerful voice ride hunting hawking adventure sick guest take much thought spend many hour distance soften step lower voice enter hall asleep 
9,"""Richard, is it you?"" said the little boy, as the young figure came round the settle in the darkening twilight.",say little boy young figure come settle darken twilight 
10,"""Yes.  How do you feel now, Carloman; are you better?""",feel good 
11,"""No better, thanks, dear Richard;"" and the little wasted fingers were put into his.",good thanks dear little waste finger put 
12,"""Has the pain come again?""",pain come 
13,"""No; I have been lying still, musing; Richard, I shall never be better.""",lie muse good 
14,"""Oh, do not say so!  You will, indeed you will, when spring comes.""",say spring come 
15,"""I feel as if I should die,"" said the little boy; ""I think I shall.  But do not grieve, Richard.  I do not feel much afraid.  You said it was happier there than here, and I know it now.""",feel die say little boy think grieve feel afraid say happy know 
16,"""Where my blessed father is,"" said Richard, thoughtfully.  ""But oh, Carloman, you are so young to die!""",bless father say young die 
17,"""I do not want to live.  This is a fighting, hard world, full of cruel people; and it is peace there.  You are strong and brave, and will make them better; but I am weak and fearful--I could only sigh and grieve.""",want live fight hard world full cruel person peace strong brave make good weak fearful sigh grieve 
18,"""Oh, Carloman!  Carloman!  I cannot spare you.  I love you like my own brother.  You must not die--you must live to see your father and mother again!""",spare love own brother die live see father mother 
19,"""Commend me to them,"" said Carloman.  ""I am going to my Father in heaven. I am glad I am here, Richard; I never was so happy before.  I should have been afraid indeed to die, if Father Lucas had not taught me how my sins are pardoned.  Now, I think the Saints and Angels are waiting for me.""",commend say go father heaven glad happy afraid die teach sin pardon think wait 
20,"He spoke feebly, and his last words faltered into sleep.  He slept on; and when supper was brought, and the lamps were lighted, Fru Astrida thought the little face looked unusually pale and waxen; but he did not awake.  At night, they carried him to his bed, and he was roused into a half conscious state, moaning at being disturbed.  Fru Astrida would not leave him, and Father Lucas shared her watch.",speak last word falter sleep sleep supper bring lamp light think little face look pale waxen awake night carry bed rouse half conscious state moan disturb leave share watch 
21,"At midnight, all were wakened by the slow notes, falling one by one on the ear, of the solemn passing-bell, calling them to waken, that their prayers might speed a soul on its way.  Richard and Lothaire were soon at the bedside.  Carloman lay still asleep, his hands folded on his breast, but his breath came in long gasps.  Father Lucas was praying over him, and candles were placed on each side of the bed.  All was still, the boys not daring to speak or move.  There came a longer breath--then they heard no more.  He was, indeed, gone to a happier home--a truer royalty than ever had been his on earth.",midnight waken slow note fall ear solemn passing bell call wake prayer speed soul way bedside lay asleep hand fold breast breath come long gasp pray candle place side bed boy dare speak move come long breath hear more go happy home truer royalty earth 
22,"Then the boys' grief burst out.  Lothaire screamed for his mother, and sobbed out that he should die too--he must go home.  Richard stood by the bed, large silent tears rolling down his cheeks, and his chest heaving with suppressed sobs.",boy grief burst scream mother sobb die go stand bed large silent tear roll cheek chest heave suppress sob 
23,"Fru Astrida led them from the room, back to their beds.  Lothaire soon cried himself to sleep.  Richard lay awake, sorrowful, and in deep thought; while that scene in St. Mary's, at Rouen, returned before his eyes, and though it had passed nearly two years ago, its meaning and its teaching had sunk deep into his mind, and now stood before him more completely.",lead room bed cry sleep lay awake sorrowful deep thought scene return eye pass year meaning teaching sink mind stand 
24,"""Where shall I go, when I come to die, if I have not returned good for evil?""  And a resolution was taken in the mind of the little Duke.",go come die return good evil resolution take mind little 
25,"Morning came, and brought back the sense that his gentle little companion was gone from him; and Richard wept again, as if he could not be consoled, as he beheld the screened couch where the patient smile would never again greet him.  He now knew that he had loved Carloman all the more for his weakness and helplessness; but his grief was not like Lothaire's, for with the Prince's was still joined a selfish fear: his cry was still, that he should die too, if not set free, and violent weeping really made him heavy and ill.",morning come bring sense gentle little companion gone goot console beheld screen couch patient smile greet know love more weakness helplessness grief join selfish fear cry die set free violent weeping make heavy ill 
26,"The little corpse, embalmed and lapped in lead, was to be sent back to France, that it might rest with its forefathers in the city of Rheims; and Lothaire seemed to feel this as an additional stroke of desertion. He was almost beside himself with despair, imploring every one, in turn, to send him home, though he well knew they were unable to do so.",little corpse embalm lap lead send rest forefather city seem feel additional stroke desertion despair implor one turn send know unable do
