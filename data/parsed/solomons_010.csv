2,"It will not be necessary for me to detail at length the incidents of our journey to Loo. It took two full days' travelling along Solomon's Great Road, which pursued its even course right into the heart of Kukuanaland. Suffice it to say that as we went the country seemed to grow richer and richer, and the kraals, with their wide surrounding belts of cultivation, more and more numerous. They were all built upon the same principles as the first camp which we had reached, and were guarded by ample garrisons of troops. Indeed, in Kukuanaland, as among the Germans, the Zulus, and the Masai, every able-bodied man is a soldier, so that the whole force of the nation is available for its wars, offensive or defensive. As we travelled we were overtaken by thousands of warriors hurrying up to Loo to be present at the great annual review and festival, and more splendid troops I never saw.",necessary detail length incident journey take full day travelling great pursue even course heart suffice say go country seem grow richer richer kraal wide surround belt cultivation numerous build same principle first camp reach guard ample garrison troops able bodied man soldier whole force nation available war offensive defensive travel overtake thousand warrior hurry present great annual review festival splendid troops see 
3,"At sunset on the second day, we stopped to rest awhile upon the summit of some heights over which the road ran, and there on a beautiful and fertile plain before us lay Loo itself. For a native town it is an enormous place, quite five miles round, I should say, with outlying kraals projecting from it, that serve on grand occasions as cantonments for the regiments, and a curious horseshoe-shaped hill, with which we were destined to become better acquainted, about two miles to the north. It is beautifully situated, and through the centre of the kraal, dividing it into two portions, runs a river, which appeared to be bridged in several places, the same indeed that we had seen from the slopes of Sheba's Breasts. Sixty or seventy miles away three great snow-capped mountains, placed at the points of a triangle, started out of the level plain. The conformation of these mountains is unlike that of Sheba's Breasts, being sheer and precipitous, instead of smooth and rounded.",sunset second day stop rest summit height road run beautiful fertile plain lay native town enormous place mile say outly kraal project serve grand occasion cantonment regiment curious horseshoe shape hill destine become acquainted mile north situate centre kraal divide portion run river appear bridg several place same see slope mile great snow cap mountain place point triangle start level plain conformation mountain breast sheer precipitous smooth round

21,"Slowly the sun sank, then suddenly darkness rushed down on the land like a tangible thing. There was no breathing-space between the day and night, no soft transformation scene, for in these latitudes twilight does not exist. The change from day to night is as quick and as absolute as the change from life to death. The sun sank and the world was wreathed in shadows. But not for long, for see in the west there is a glow, then come rays of silver light, and at last the full and glorious moon lights up the plain and shoots its gleaming arrows far and wide, filling the earth with a faint refulgence.",sun sink darkness rush land tangible thing be breathing space day night soft transformation scene latitude twilight exist change day night quick absolute change life death sun sink world wreathe shadow see west be glow come ray silver light last full glorious moon light plain shoot gleam arrow fill earth faint refulgence 
22,"We stood and watched the lovely sight, whilst the stars grew pale before this chastened majesty, and felt our hearts lifted up in the presence of a beauty that I cannot describe. Mine has been a rough life, but there are a few things I am thankful to have lived for, and one of them is to have seen that moon shine over Kukuanaland.",stand watch lovely sight star grow pale chasten majesty feel heart lift presence beauty describe rough life be few thing thankful live see moon shine

25,"We assented, and in an hour's time were at the outskirts of the town, of which the extent, mapped out as it was by thousands of camp fires, appeared absolutely endless. Indeed, Good, who is always fond of a bad joke, christened it ""Unlimited Loo."" Soon we came to a moat with a drawbridge, where we were met by the rattling of arms and the hoarse challenge of a sentry. Infadoos gave some password that I could not catch, which was met with a salute, and we passed on through the central street of the great grass city. After nearly half an hour's tramp, past endless lines of huts, Infadoos halted at last by the gate of a little group of huts which surrounded a small courtyard of powdered limestone, and informed us that these were to be our ""poor"" quarters.",assent hour time outskirt town extent map thousand camp fire appear endless fond bad joke christen unlimited come moat drawbridge meet rattling arm hoarse challenge sentry give password catch meet salute pass central street great grass city hour tramp past endless line hut halt last gate little group hut surround small courtyard powder limestone inform poor quarter 
26,"We entered, and found that a hut had been assigned to each of us. These huts were superior to any that we had yet seen, and in each was a most comfortable bed made of tanned skins, spread upon mattresses of aromatic grass. Food too was ready for us, and so soon as we had washed ourselves with water, which stood ready in earthenware jars, some young women of handsome appearance brought us roasted meats, and mealie cobs daintily served on wooden platters, and presented them to us with deep obeisances.",enter find hut assign hut superior see comfortable bed make tann skin spread mattress aromatic grass food ready wash water stand ready earthenware jar young woman handsome appearance bring roast meat mealie cob serve wooden plateer present deep obeisance

28,"When we woke it was to find the sun high in the heavens, and the female attendants, who did not seem to be troubled by any false shame, already standing inside the hut, having been ordered to attend and help us to ""make ready.""",wake find sun high heaven female attendant seem trouble false shame stand hut order attend help make ready

31,"Somewhat to their astonishment and disappointment, having requested the young ladies to step outside, we proceeded to make the best toilet of which the circumstances admitted. Good even went the length of again shaving the right side of his face; the left, on which now appeared a very fair crop of whiskers, we impressed upon him he must on no account touch. As for ourselves, we were contented with a good wash and combing our hair. Sir Henry's yellow locks were now almost upon his shoulders, and he looked more like an ancient Dane than ever, while my grizzled scrub was fully an inch long, instead of half an inch, which in a general way I considered my maximum length.",astonishment disappointment request young lady step proceed make good toilet circumstance admit good go length shave right side face left appear fair crop whisker impress account touch content good wash comb hair yellow lock shoulder look ancient grizzled scrub inch long inch general way consider maximum length

33,"We remarked in reply that we should prefer to wait till the sun was a little higher, we were yet weary with our journey, &c., &c. It is always well, when dealing with uncivilised people, not to be in too great a hurry. They are apt to mistake politeness for awe or servility. So, although we were quite as anxious to see Twala as Twala could be to see us, we sat down and waited for an hour, employing the interval in preparing such presents as our slender stock of goods permitted--namely, the Winchester rifle which had been used by poor Ventvögel, and some beads. The rifle and ammunition we determined to present to his royal highness, and the beads were for his wives and courtiers. We had already given a few to Infadoos and Scragga, and found that they were delighted with them, never having seen such things before. At length we declared that we were ready, and guided by Infadoos, started off to the audience, Umbopa carrying the rifle and beads.",remark reply prefer wait sun little high weary journey &c. deal uncivilised person great hurry apt mistake politeness awe servility anxious see see sit wait hour employ interval prepare such present slender stock goods permit rifle use poor bead rifle ammunition determine present royal highness bead wife courtier give few find delight see such thing length declare ready guide start audience carry rifle bead 
34,"After walking a few hundred yards we came to an enclosure, something like that surrounding the huts which had been allotted to us, only fifty times as big, for it could not have covered less than six or seven acres of ground. All round the outside fence stood a row of huts, which were the habitations of the king's wives. Exactly opposite the gateway, on the further side of the open space, was a very large hut, built by itself, in which his majesty resided. All the rest was open ground; that is to say, it would have been open had it not been filled by company after company of warriors, who were mustered there to the number of seven or eight thousand. These men stood still as statues as we advanced through them, and it would be impossible to give an adequate idea of the grandeur of the spectacle which they presented, with their waving plumes, their glancing spears, and iron-backed ox-hide shields.",walk few yard come enclosure surround hut allot time big cover less acre ground outside fence stand row hut habitation king wife gateway further side open space large hut build majesty reside rest open ground say open fill company company warrior muster number man stand statue advance impossible give adequate idea grandeur spectacle present wave plume glancing spear iron back ox hide shield 
35,"The space in front of the large hut was empty, but before it were placed several stools. On three of these, at a sign from Infadoos, we seated ourselves, Umbopa standing behind us. As for Infadoos, he took up a position by the door of the hut. So we waited for ten minutes or more in the midst of a dead silence, but conscious that we were the object of the concentrated gaze of some eight thousand pairs of eyes. It was a somewhat trying ordeal, but we carried it off as best we could. At length the door of the hut opened, and a gigantic figure, with a splendid tiger-skin karross flung over its shoulders, stepped out, followed by the boy Scragga, and what appeared to us to be a withered-up monkey, wrapped in a fur cloak. The figure seated itself upon a stool, Scragga took his stand behind it, and the withered-up monkey crept on all fours into the shade of the hut and squatted down.",space front large hut empty place several stool sign seat stand take position door hut wait minute more midst dead silence conscious object concentrate gaze pair eye try ordeal carry good length door hut open gigantic figure splendid tiger skin karross flung shoulder step follow boy appear wither monkey wrap fur cloak figure seat stool take stand wither monkey creep four shade hut squatet 
36,Still there was silence.,be silence 
37,"Then the gigantic figure slipped off the karross and stood up before us, a truly alarming spectacle. It was that of an enormous man with the most entirely repulsive countenance we had ever beheld. This man's lips were as thick as a Negro's, the nose was flat, he had but one gleaming black eye, for the other was represented by a hollow in the face, and his whole expression was cruel and sensual to a degree. From the large head rose a magnificent plume of white ostrich feathers, his body was clad in a shirt of shining chain armour, whilst round the waist and right knee were the usual garnishes of white ox-tail. In his right hand was a huge spear, about the neck a thick torque of gold, and bound on the forehead shone dully a single and enormous uncut diamond.",gigantic figure slip karross stand alarming spectacle enormous man repulsive countenance beheld man lip thick nose flat have gleam black eye other represent hollow face whole expression cruel sensual degree large head rise magnificent plume white ostrich feather body clad shirt shine chain armour waist right knee usual garnish white ox tail right hand huge spear neck thick torque gold bind forehead shine single enormous uncut diamond 
38,"Still there was silence; but not for long. Presently the man, whom we rightly guessed to be the king, raised the great javelin in his hand. Instantly eight thousand spears were lifted in answer, and from eight thousand throats rang out the royal salute of ""_Koom_."" Three times this was repeated, and each time the earth shook with the noise, that can only be compared to the deepest notes of thunder.",be silence man guess king raise great javelin hand spear lift answer throat ring royal salute time repeat time earth shake noise compare deep note thunder

52,"""Once, twice,"" he waved the spear, and then struck, ah! right home--the spear stood out a foot behind the soldier's back. He flung up his hands and dropped dead. From the multitude about us rose something like a murmur, it rolled round and round, and died away.

It crept on all fours, but when it reached the place where the king sat it rose upon its feet, and throwing the furry covering from its face, revealed a most extraordinary and weird countenance. Apparently it was that of a woman of great age so shrunken that in size it seemed no larger than the face of a year-old child, although made up of a number of deep and yellow wrinkles. Set in these wrinkles was a sunken slit, that represented the mouth, beneath which the chin curved outwards to a point. There was no nose to speak of; indeed, the visage might have been taken for that of a sun-dried corpse had it not been for a pair of large black eyes, still full of fire and intelligence, which gleamed and played under the snow-white eyebrows, and the projecting parchment-coloured skull, like jewels in a charnel-house. As for the head itself, it was perfectly bare, and yellow in hue, while its wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the hood of a cobra.",king take lay foot observe wizened monkey figure creep shadow hut creep four reach place king sit rise foot throw furry covering face reveal extraordinary weird countenance woman great age shrunk size seem large face year old child make number deep yellow wrinkle set wrinkle sink slit represent mouth chin curved point be nose speak visage take sun dry corpse pair large black eye full fire intelligence gleam play snow white eyebrow project parchment coloured skull jewel charnel house head bare yellow hue wrinkled scalp move contract hood cobra 
98,"The figure to which this fearful countenance belonged, a countenance so fearful indeed that it caused a shiver of fear to pass through us as we gazed on it, stood still for a moment. Then suddenly it projected a skinny claw armed with nails nearly an inch long, and laying it on the shoulder of Twala the king, began to speak in a thin and piercing voice--",figure fearful countenance belong countenance fearful cause shiver fear pass gaze stand moment project skinny claw arm nail inch lay shoulder king begin speak thin piercing voice
