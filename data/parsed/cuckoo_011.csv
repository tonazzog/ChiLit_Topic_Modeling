It _was_ a short cut home, and it was very comfortable in the boat, and I certainly saw a great deal last night, and I'm very much obliged to you--particularly for making it all right with Phil about not coming to play with me to-day. Ah! that reminds me, I'm in disgrace. I wonder if Aunt Grizzel will really make me stay in my room all day. How tired I shall be, and what will Mr. Kneebreeches think! But it serves me right.

7,"""Exceedingly well, thank you, Dorcas.

8,"""That's good news,"" said Dorcas in a tone of relief; ""and I've good news for you, too, missie. At least, I hope you'll think it so.

11,"""It seems to me, Dorcas,"" said Griselda dreamily, when, a few minutes later, she was standing by the window while the old servant brushed out her thick, wavy hair, ""it seems to me, Dorcas, that it's _all_ 'obeying orders' together. There's the sun now, just getting up, and the moon just going to bed--_they_ are always obeying, aren't they?

""So will you please tell Aunt Grizzel that I'm very sorry about last night, and I'll do just as she likes about staying in my room or anything. But, if she _would_ let me, I'd far rather go down and do my lessons as usual for Mr. Kneebreeches.

15,"""I only hope the child's not going to be ill,"" she said to herself. But she proved a skilful ambassadress, notwithstanding her misgivings; and Griselda's imprisonment confined her only to the bounds of the house and terrace walk, instead of within the four walls of her own little room, as she had feared.",hope child go ill say prove skilful ambassadress notwithstand misgiving imprisonment confine bound house terrace walk wall own little room fear

20,"Lady Lavander knew all about him; his father and mother were friends of hers, for whom she had a great regard, and for some time she had been intending to ask the little boy to spend the day at Merrybrow Hall, to be introduced to her god-daughter Griselda. So, _of course_, as Lady Lavander knew all about him, there could be no objection to his playing in Miss Grizzel's garden!",know father mother friend have great regard time intend ask little boy spend day introduce god daughter course know be objection playing garden

22,"""What did you do yesterday, Phil?"" asked Griselda. ""Were you sorry not to come to play with me?""",do yesterday ask sorry come play

27,"""Very well,"" said Griselda; and off they set.",say set 
28,"Whether it was the way to fairyland or not, it was not to be wondered at that little Phil thought so. He led Griselda right across the wood to a part where she had never been before. It was pretty rough work part of the way. The children had to fight with brambles and bushes, and here and there to creep through on hands and knees, and Griselda had to remind Phil several times of her promise to his nurse that his clothes should not be the worse for his playing with her, to prevent his scrambling through ""anyhow"" and leaving bits of his knickerbockers behind him.",way fairyland wonder little think lead wood part rough work part way child have fight bramble bush creep hand knee have remind several time promise nurse clothes bad playing prevent scramble anyhow leave bit knickerbocker 
29,"But when at last they reached Phil's favourite spot all their troubles were forgotten. Oh, how pretty it was! It was a sort of tiny glade in the very middle of the wood--a little green nest enclosed all round by trees, and right through it the merry brook came rippling along as if rejoicing at getting out into the sunlight again for a while. And all the choicest and sweetest of the early summer flowers seemed to be collected here in greater variety and profusion than in any other part of the wood.",last reach favourite spot trouble forget sort tiny glade very middle wood little green nest enclose tree merry brook come ripple rejoice get sunlight while choicest sweetest early summer flower seem collect great variety profusion other part wood 
30,"""_Isn't_ it nice?"" said Phil, as he nestled down beside Griselda on the soft, mossy grass. ""It must have been a fairies' garden some time, I'm sure, and I shouldn't wonder if one of the doors into fairyland is hidden somewhere here, if only we could find it.""",nice say nestle soft mossy grass fairy garden time sure wonder door fairyland hide find

32,"Then at Phil's suggestion they set to work to make themselves a house in the centre of this fairies' garden, as he called it. They managed it very much to their own satisfaction, by dragging some logs of wood and big stones from among the brushwood hard by, and filling the holes up with bracken and furze.",suggestion set work make house centre fairy garden call manage own satisfaction drag log wood big stone brushwood fill hole bracken furze 
33,"""And if the fairies _do_ come here,"" said Phil, ""they'll be very pleased to find a house all ready, won't they?""",fairy come say pleased find house ready 
34,"Then they had to gather flowers to ornament the house inside, and dry leaves and twigs all ready for a fire in one corner. Altogether it was quite a business, I can assure you, and when it was finished they were very hot and very tired and _rather_ dirty. Suddenly a thought struck Griselda.",have gather flower ornament house dry leave twig ready fire corner business assure finish hot tired dirty thought strike

47,"They had followed the little path till it came to a point where two roads, rough cart-ruts only, met; or, rather, where the path ran across the road. Right, or left, or straight on, which should it be? Griselda stood still in perplexity. Already it was growing dusk; already the moon's soft light was beginning faintly to glimmer through the branches. Griselda looked up to the sky.",follow little path come point road rough cart rut meet path run road right leave stand perplexity grow dusk moon soft light begin glimmer branch look sky

55,"They had some way to go, for they had wandered far in a wrong direction, but the cuckoo never failed them. Whenever they were at a loss--whenever the path turned or divided, they heard his clear, sweet call; and, without the least misgiving, they followed it, till at last it brought them out upon the high-road, a stone's throw from Farmer Crouch's gate.",have way go wander wrong direction cuckoo fail loss path turn divide hear clear sweet call least misgiving follow last bring high road stone throw gate

58,"There was a little bustle about the door of the farmhouse as the children wearily came up to it. Two or three men were standing together receiving directions from Mr. Crouch himself, and Phil's nurse was talking eagerly. Suddenly she caught sight of the truants.",be little bustle door farmhouse child come man stand receive direction nurse talk catch sight truant 
59,"""Here he is, Mr. Crouch!"" she exclaimed. ""No need now to send to look for him. Oh, Master Phil, how could you stay out so late?

61,"More to please Phil than from any wish for ""supper,"" for she was really in a fidget to get home, Griselda let the little boy lead her into the parlour. But she was for a moment perfectly startled by the cry that broke from him when he opened the door and looked into the room.
