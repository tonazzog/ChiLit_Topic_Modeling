2,"She caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in another moment the White Queen came running wildly through the wood, with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and Alice very civilly went to meet her with the shawl.",catch shawl speak look owner moment white come run wood arm stretch fly go meet shawl

4,"The White Queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way, and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like ‘bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,’ and Alice felt that if there was to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. So she began rather timidly: ‘Am I addressing the White Queen?’",white look helpless frighten sort way keep repeat whisper sound bread butter bread butter feel be be conversation manage begin address white

8,"It would have been all the better, as it seemed to Alice, if she had got some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. ‘Every single thing’s crooked,’ Alice thought to herself, ‘and she’s all over pins!--may I put your shawl straight for you?’ she added aloud.",good seem get one else dress untidy single thing crooked think pin put shawl add

26,‘What sort of things do YOU remember best?’ Alice ventured to ask.,sort thing remember good venture ask 
27,"‘Oh, things that happened the week after next,’ the Queen replied in a careless tone. ‘For instance, now,’ she went on, sticking a large piece of plaster on her finger as she spoke, ‘there’s the King’s Messenger. He’s in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn’t even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.’",thing happen week reply careless tone instance go stick large piece plaster finger speak be prison punish trial begin next course crime come last

36,"Alice was just beginning to say ‘There’s a mistake somewhere--,’ when the Queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished. ‘Oh, oh, oh!’ shouted the Queen, shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off. ‘My finger’s bleeding! Oh, oh, oh, oh!’",begin say be mistake begin scream have leave sentence unfinished shout shake hand want shake finger bleed 
37,"Her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that Alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.",scream whistle steam engine have hold hand ear

Oh, oh!’ As she said the words the brooch flew open, and the Queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it again.",fast shawl poor groan brooch come undone say word brooch fly open clutch try clasp 
42,"‘Take care!’ cried Alice. ‘You’re holding it all crooked!’ And she caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the Queen had pricked her finger.",take care cry hold crooked catch brooch late pin slip prick finger

45,"‘Why, I’ve done all the screaming already,’ said the Queen. ‘What would be the good of having it all over again?’",do scream say good have

47,"‘I wish _I_ could manage to be glad!’ the Queen said. ‘Only I never can remember the rule. You must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like!’",wish manage glad say remember rule happy live wood glad like 
48,‘Only it is so VERY lonely here!’ Alice said in a melancholy voice; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks.,lonely say melancholy voice thought loneliness large tear come roll cheek 
49,"‘Oh, don’t go on like that!’ cried the poor Queen, wringing her hands in despair. ‘Consider what a great girl you are. Consider what a long way you’ve come to-day. Consider what o’clock it is. Consider anything, only don’t cry!’",go cry poor wring hand despair consider great girl consider long way come day consider o'clock consider cry

57,"‘I daresay you haven’t had much practice,’ said the Queen. ‘When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!’",have much practice say age do half hour day believe many impossible thing breakfast go shawl 
58,"The brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew the Queen’s shawl across a little brook. The Queen spread out her arms again, and went flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself. ‘I’ve got it!’ she cried in a triumphant tone. ‘Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!’",brooch come undone speak sudden gust wind blow shawl little brook spread arm go fly time succeed catching get cry triumphant tone see pin

64,"She looked at the Queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool. Alice rubbed her eyes, and looked again. She couldn’t make out what had happened at all. Was she in a shop? And was that really--was it really a SHEEP that was sitting on the other side of the counter? Rub as she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was an old Sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.",look seem wrap wool rub eye look make happen shop sheep sit other side counter rub make more little dark shop lean elbow counter old sheep sit arm chair knitting leave look great pair spectacle 
65,"‘What is it you want to buy?’ the Sheep said at last, looking up for a moment from her knitting.",want buy say last look moment knitting

68,"But these, as it happened, Alice had NOT got: so she contented herself with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.",happen get content turn look shelf come 
69,"The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the oddest part of it all was, that whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty: though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold.",shop seem full manner curious thing oddest part look shelf make have particular shelf empty other crowd full hold 
70,"‘Things flow about so here!’ she said at last in a plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing, that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a work-box, and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at. ‘And this one is the most provoking of all--but I’ll tell you what--’ she added, as a sudden thought struck her, ‘I’ll follow it up to the very top shelf of all. It’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!’",thing flow say last plaintive tone spend minute pursue large bright thing look doll work box shelf one look one provoking tell add sudden thought strike follow very top shelf puzzle go ceiling expect 
71,"But even this plan failed: the ‘thing’ went through the ceiling as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.",plan fail thing go ceiling possible use 
72,"‘Are you a child or a teetotum?’ the Sheep said, as she took up another pair of needles. ‘You’ll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round like that.’ She was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and Alice couldn’t help looking at her in great astonishment.",child teetotum say take pair needle make giddy go turn work pair help look great astonishment 
73,‘How CAN she knit with so many?’ the puzzled child thought to herself. ‘She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!’,knit many puzzle child think get more porcupine minute 
74,"‘Can you row?’ the Sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles as she spoke.",row ask hand pair knitting needle speak 
75,"‘Yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--’ Alice was beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between banks: so there was nothing for it but to do her best.",little land needle begin say needle turn oar hand find little boat glide bank be do good 
76,"‘Feather!’ cried the Sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.",feather cry take pair needle 
77,"This didn’t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so Alice said nothing, but pulled away. There was something very queer about the water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and would hardly come out again.",sound remark need answer say pull be queer water think oar get fast come 
78,"‘Feather! Feather!’ the Sheep cried again, taking more needles. ‘You’ll be catching a crab directly.’",feather feather cry take more needle catching crab 
79,‘A dear little crab!’ thought Alice. ‘I should like that.’,dear little crab think like 
80,"‘Didn’t you hear me say “Feather”?’ the Sheep cried angrily, taking up quite a bunch of needles.",hear say feather cry take bunch needle 
81,"‘Indeed I did,’ said Alice: ‘you’ve said it very often--and very loud. Please, where ARE the crabs?’",say say crab 
82,"‘In the water, of course!’ said the Sheep, sticking some of the needles into her hair, as her hands were full. ‘Feather, I say!’",water course say stick needle hair hand full feather say 
83,"‘WHY do you say “feather” so often?’ Alice asked at last, rather vexed. ‘I’m not a bird!’",say feather ask last vex bird 
84,"‘You are,’ said the Sheep: ‘you’re a little goose.’",say little goose 
85,"This offended Alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever), and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks frowning over their heads.",offend little be more conversation minute boat glide bed weed make oar stick water bad tree same tall river bank frown head 
86,"‘Oh, please! There are some scented rushes!’ Alice cried in a sudden transport of delight. ‘There really are--and SUCH beauties!’",be scented rushe cry sudden transport delight be such beauty 
87,"‘You needn’t say “please” to ME about ‘em,’ the Sheep said, without looking up from her knitting: ‘I didn’t put ‘em there, and I’m not going to take ‘em away.’",say say look knitting put go take 
88,"‘No, but I meant--please, may we wait and pick some?’ Alice pleaded. ‘If you don’t mind stopping the boat for a minute.’",mean wait pick plead mind stop boat minute 
89,"‘How am _I_ to stop it?’ said the Sheep. ‘If you leave off rowing, it’ll stop of itself.’",stop say leave rowing stop 
90,"So the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it glided gently in among the waving rushes. And then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for a while Alice forgot all about the Sheep and the knitting, as she bent over the side of the boat, with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water--while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes.",boat leave drift stream glide wave rushe little sleeve roll little arm plunge elbow deep get rushe good long way break while forget knitting bend side boat end tangle hair dip water bright eager eye catch bunch darling scent rushe 
91,"‘I only hope the boat won’t tipple over!’ she said to herself. ‘Oh, WHAT a lovely one! Only I couldn’t quite reach it.’ ‘And it certainly DID seem a little provoking (‘almost as if it happened on purpose,’ she thought) that, though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by, there was always a more lovely one that she couldn’t reach.",hope boat tipple say lovely one reach seem little provoking happen purpose think manage pick plenty beautiful rushe boat glide be lovely one reach 
92,"‘The prettiest are always further!’ she said at last, with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and began to arrange her new-found treasures.",prettiest further say last sigh obstinacy rushe grow flush cheek drip hair hand scramble place begin arrange new find treasure 
93,"What mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she picked them? Even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little while--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as they lay in heaps at her feet--but Alice hardly noticed this, there were so many other curious things to think about.",matter rushe begin fade lose scent beauty very moment pick real scented rushe know last little while dream rushe melt snow lay heap foot notice be many other curious thing think 
94,"They hadn’t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and WOULDN’T come out again (so Alice explained it afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of ‘Oh, oh, oh!’ from poor Alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among the heap of rushes.",go blade oar get water come explain consequence handle catch chin spite series little shriek poor sweep seat heap rushe 
95,"However, she wasn’t hurt, and was soon up again: the Sheep went on with her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. ‘That was a nice crab you caught!’ she remarked, as Alice got back into her place, very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.",hurt go knitting while happen nice crab catch remark get place relieve find boat 
96,"‘Was it? I didn’t see it,’ Said Alice, peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water. ‘I wish it hadn’t let go--I should so like to see a little crab to take home with me!’ But the Sheep only laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.",see said peep side boat dark water wish let go like see little crab take laugh go knitting 
97,‘Are there many crabs here?’ said Alice.,be many crab say 
98,"‘Crabs, and all sorts of things,’ said the Sheep: ‘plenty of choice, only make up your mind. Now, what DO you want to buy?’",crab sort thing say plenty choice make mind want buy 
99,"‘To buy!’ Alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened--for the oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.",buy echoe tone astonished half frighten oar boat river vanish moment little dark shop 
100,"‘I should like to buy an egg, please,’ she said timidly. ‘How do you sell them?’",like buy egg say sell 
101,"‘Fivepence farthing for one--Twopence for two,’ the Sheep replied.",fivepence farthing reply 
102,"‘Then two are cheaper than one?’ Alice said in a surprised tone, taking out her purse.",cheap say surprise tone take purse 
103,"‘Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two,’ said the Sheep.",eat buy say 
104,"‘Then I’ll have ONE, please,’ said Alice, as she put the money down on the counter. For she thought to herself, ‘They mightn’t be at all nice, you know.’",have say put money counter think nice know 
105,"The Sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said ‘I never put things into people’s hands--that would never do--you must get it for yourself.’ And so saying, she went off to the other end of the shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.",take money put box say put thing person hand do get say go other end shop set egg shelf 
106,"‘I wonder WHY it wouldn’t do?’ thought Alice, as she groped her way among the tables and chairs, for the shop was very dark towards the end. ‘The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it. Let me see, is this a chair? Why, it’s got branches, I declare! How very odd to find trees growing here! And actually here’s a little brook! Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!’",wonder do think grope way table chair shop dark end egg seem get more walk let see chair get branch declare odd find tree grow little brook very queerest shop see
