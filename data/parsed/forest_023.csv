2," The next morning, before they had quitted their beds, a messenger arrived with letters from General Middleton, and from him they found that the king's army had encamped on the evening before not six miles from Portlake. As they hastily dressed themselves, Chaloner proposed to Edward that a little alteration in his dress would be necessary; and taking him to a wardrobe in which had been put aside some suits of his own, worn when he was a younger and slighter-made man than he now was, he requested Edward to make use of them. Edward, who was aware that Chaloner was right in his proposal, selected two suits of colors which pleased him most; and dressing in one, and changing his hat for one more befitting his new attire, was transformed into a handsome Cavalier. As soon as they had broken their fast they took leave of the old ladies, and mounting their horses set off for the camp. An hour's ride brought them to the outposts; and communicating with the officer on duty, they were conducted by an orderly to the tent of General Middleton, who received Chaloner with great warmth as an old friend, and was very courteous to Edward as soon as he heard that he was the son of Colonel Beverley.",next morning quit bed messenger arrive letter find king army encamp evening mile dress propose little alteration dress necessary take wardrobe put suit own wear young slighter make man request make use aware right proposal select suit color pleased most dress change hat befit new attire transform handsome break take leave old lady mount horse set camp hour ride bring outpost communicate officer duty conduct orderly tent receive great warmth old friend courteous hear son

13,"""Indeed!"" replied his majesty; ""I heard that all his family perished at the ruthless burning of Arnwood. I hold myself fortunate, as a king, that even one son of so loyal and brave a gentleman as Colonel Beverley has escaped. You are welcome, young sir--most welcome to us; you must be near us; the very name of Beverley will be pleasing to our ears by night or day.""",reply majesty hear family perish ruthless burning hold fortunate king son loyal brave gentleman escape welcome young sir welcome very name pleasing ear night day

18,"After a few more courteous words from his majesty, they withdrew, but General Middleton was recalled by the king for a minute or two to receive his commands. When he rejoined Edward and Chaloner, he said to Edward--",few more courteous word majesty withdraw recall king minute receive command rejoin say 
19,"""I have orders to send in for his majesty's signature your commission as captain of horse, and attached to the king's personal staff; it is a high compliment to the memory of your father, sir, and, I may add, your own personal appearance.

22,"Edward was soon equipped, and now attended upon the king. When they arrived at Warrington, they found a body of horse drawn up to oppose their passage onward. These were charged, and fled with a trifling loss; and as they were known to be commanded by Lambert, one of Cromwell's best generals, there was great exultation in the king's army; but the fact was, that Lambert had acted upon Cromwell's orders, which were to harass and delay the march of the king as much as possible, but not to risk with his small force any thing like an engagement. After this skirmish it was considered advisable to send back the Earl of Derby and many other officers of importance into Lancashire, that they might collect the king's adherents in that quarter and in Cheshire. Accordingly the earl, with about two hundred officers and gentlemen, left the army with that intention. It was then considered that it would be advisable to march the army direct to London; but the men were so fatigued with the rapidity of the march up to the present time, and the weather was so warm, that it was decided in the negative; and as Worcester was a town well affected to the king, and the country abounded with provisions, it was resolved that the army should march there, and wait for English re-enforcements. This was done; the city opened the gates with every mark of satisfaction, and supplied the army with all that it required. The first bad news which reached them was the dispersion and defeat of the whole of the Earl of Derby's party, by a regiment of militia which had surprised them at Wigan during the night, when they were all asleep, and had no idea that any enemy was near to them. Although attacked at such disadvantage, they defended themselves till a large portion of them was killed, and the remainder were taken prisoners, and most of them brutally put to death. The Earl of Derby was made a prisoner, but not put to death with the others.",equip attend king arrive find body horse draw oppose passage charge flead trifl loss know command good general be great exultation king army fact act order harass delay march king possible risk small force thing engagement skirmish consider advisable send many other officer importance collect king adherent quarter earl officer gentleman leave army intention consider advisable march army direct man fatigued rapidity march present time weather warm decide negative town affect king country abound provision resolve army march wait english re-enforcement do city open gate mark satisfaction supply army require first bad news reach dispersion defeat whole party regiment militia surprise night asleep have idea enemy attack such disadvantage defend large portion kill remainder take prisoner most put death make prisoner put death other 
23,"""This is bad news, Chaloner,"" said Edward.",bad news say 
24,"""Yes; it is more than bad,"" replied the latter; ""we have lost our best officers, who never should have left the army; and now the consequences of the defeat will be, that we shall not have any people come forward to join us. The winning side is the right side in this world; and there is more evil than that; the Duke of Buckingham has claimed the command of the army, which the king has refused, so that we are beginning to fight among ourselves. General Leslie is evidently dispirited, and thinks bad of the cause. Middleton is the only man who does his duty. Depend upon it, we shall have Cromwell upon us before we are aware of it; and we are in a state of sad confusion: officers quarreling, men disobedient, much talking, and little doing. Here we have been five days, and the works which have been proposed to be thrown up as defenses, not yet begun.""",more bad reply latter lose good officer leave army consequence defeat have person come join win side right side world be more evil claim command army king refuse begin fight dispirite think bad cause only man do duty depend have aware state sad confusion officer quarrel man disobedient talk little do day work propose throw defens begin

26,"""He must be patient, perforce,"" replied Chaloner; ""he plays for a crown, and it is a high stake; but he can not command the minds of men, although he may the persons.

28,"""I wish I could be of your opinion, Beverley,"" replied Chaloner; ""but I have mixed with the world longer than you have, and I think otherwise.""",wish opinion reply mix world have think 
29,"Several more days passed, during which no defenses were thrown up, and the confusion and quarreling in the army continued to increase, until at last news arrived that Cromwell was within half a day's march of them, and that he had collected all the militia on his route, and was now in numbers nearly double to those in the king's army. All was amazement and confusion--nothing had been done--no arrangements had been made--Chaloner told Edward that all was lost if immediate steps were not taken.",several more day pass defens throw confusion quarreling army continue increase last news arrive day march collect militia route number double king army amazement confusion do arrangement make tell lose immediate step take 
30,"On the 3d of October, the army of Cromwell appeared in sight. Edward had been on horseback, attending the king, for the best part of the night; the disposition of the troops had been made as well as it could; and it was concluded, as Cromwell's army remained quiet, that no attempt would be made on that day. About noon the king returned to his lodging, to take some refreshment after his fatigue. Edward was with him; but before an hour had passed, the alarm came that the armies were engaged. The king mounted his horse, which was ready saddled at the door; but before he could ride out of the city, he was met and nearly beaten back by the whole body almost of his own cavalry, who came running on with such force that he could not stop them. His majesty called to several of the officers by name, but they paid no attention; and so great was the panic, that both the king and his staff, who attended him, were nearly overthrown, and trampled under foot.",3d army appear sight horseback attend king good part night disposition troops make conclude army remain quiet attempt make day noon king return lodging take refreshment fatigue hour pass alarm come army engage king mount horse ready saddle door ride city meet beat whole body own cavalry come run such force stop majesty call several officer name pay attention great panic king staff attend overthrown trample foot 
31,"Cromwell had passed a large portion of his troops over the river without the knowledge of the opponents, and when the attack was made in so unexpected a quarter, a panic ensued. Where General Middleton and the Duke Hamilton commanded, a very brave resistance was made; but Middleton being wounded, Duke Hamilton having his leg taken off by a round-shot, and many gentlemen having fallen, the troops, deserted by the remainder of the army, at last gave way, and the rout was general, the foot throwing away their muskets before they were discharged.",pass large portion troops river knowledge opponent attack make unexpected quarter panic ensue command brave resistance make wound have leg take round shot many gentleman fall troops desert remainder army last give way rout general foot throw musket discharge 
32,"His majesty rode back into the town, and found a body of horse, who had been persuaded by Chaloner to make a stand. ""Follow me,"" said his majesty; ""we will see what the enemy are about. I do not think they pursue, and if so, we may yet rally from this foolish panic.""",majesty ride town find body horse persuade make stand follow say majesty see enemy think pursue rally foolish panic 
33,"His majesty, followed by Edward, Chaloner, and several of his personal staff, then galloped out to reconnoiter; but to his mortification he found that the troops had not followed him, but gone out of the town by the other gate, and that the enemy's cavalry in pursuit were actually in the town. Under such circumstances, by the advice of Chaloner and Edward, his majesty withdrew, and, turning his horse's head, he made all haste to leave Worcester. After several hours' riding, the king found himself in company of about 4000 of the cavalry who had so disgracefully fled; but they were still so panic-struck that he could put no confidence in them, and having advised with those about him, he resolved to quit them. This he did without mentioning his intention to any of his staff, not even Chaloner or Edward--leaving at night with two of his servants, whom he dismissed as soon as it was daylight, considering that his chance of escape would be greater if he were quite alone.",majesty follow several personal staff gallop reconnoiter mortification find troops follow go town other gate enemy cavalry pursuit town such circumstance advice majesty withdraw turn horse head make haste leave several hour riding king find company cavalry flead panic strike put confidence advise resolve quit do mention intention staff leave night servant dismiss daylight consider chance escape great alone 
34,"It was not till the next morning that they discovered that the king had left them, and then they determined to separate, and, as the major portion were from Scotland, to make what haste they could back to that country. And now Chaloner and Edward consulted as to their plans.",next morning discover king leave determine separate major portion make haste country consult plan 
35,"""It appears to me,"" said Edward, laughing, ""that the danger of this campaign of ours will consist in getting back again to our own homes, for I can most safely assert that I have not as yet struck a blow for the king.""",appear say laugh danger campaign consist get own home assert strike blow king 
36,"""That is true enough, Beverly. When do you purpose going back to the New Forest? I think, if you will permit me, I will accompany you,"" said Chaloner. ""All the pursuit will be to the northward, to intercept and overtake the retreat into Scotland. I can not therefore go to Lancashire; and, indeed, as they know that I am out, they will be looking for me every where.""",true purpose go new think permit accompany say pursuit northward intercept overtake retreat go know look 
37,"""Then come with me,"" said Edward, ""I will find you protection till you can decide what to do. Let us ride on away from this, and we will talk over the matter as we go; but depend upon it, the further south we get the safer we shall be, but still not safe, unless we can change our costume. There will be a strict search for the king to the south, as they will presume that he will try to get safe to France. Hark! what is that? I heard the report of arms. Let us ride up this hill and see what is going on.""",come say find protection decide do let ride talk matter go depend further south get safe safe change costume be strict search king south presume try get safe hark hear report arm let ride hill see go

39,"""Come, Chaloner, let us at all events have one blow,"" said Edward.",come let event have blow say

The Parliamentary troopers, thinking that there were more than two coming upon them, made off after another minute's combat, leaving five or six of their men on the ground.",sudden attack decide affair parliamentary trooper think be more come make minute combat leave man ground 
42,"""Thanks, Chaloner! thanks, Beverley!"" said a voice which they immediately recognized. It was that of Grenville, one of the king's pages. ""These fellows with me were just about to run, if you had not come to our aid. I will remain with them no longer, but join you if you will permit me. At all events, remain here till they go away--I will send them off.""",thanks thanks say voice recognize king page fellow about run come aid remain join permit event remain go send

44,"The men, about fifteen in number, who had been in company with Grenville, considered that Chaloner's advice was good, and without ceremony set off, with their horses' heads to the northward, leaving Chaloner, Edward, and Grenville together on the field of the affray. About a dozen men were lying on the ground, either dead or severely wounded: seven of them were of the king's party, and the other five of the Parliamentary troops.",man number company consider advice good ceremony set horse head northward leave field affray man lie ground dead wound king party other parliamentary troops 
45,"""Now, what I propose,"" said Edward, ""is this: let us do what we can for those who are wounded, and then strip off the dresses and accouterments of those Parliamentary dragoons who are dead, and dress ourselves in them, accouterments and all. We can then pass through the country in safety, as we shall be supposed to be one of the parties looking for the king.""",propose say let do wound strip dress accouterment parliamentary dragoon dead dress accouterment pass country safety suppose party look king

48,"They tied their horses to a tree, and having given what assistance they could to the wounded men, they proceeded to strip three of the Parliamentary troopers; and then laying aside their own habiliments, they dressed themselves in the uniform of the enemy, and, mounting their horses, made all haste from the place. Having gained about twelve miles, they pulled up their horses, and rode at a more leisurely pace. It was now eight o'clock in the evening, but still not very dark; they therefore rode on another five miles, till they came to a small village, where they dismounted at an ale-house, and put their horses into the stable.",tie horse tree give assistance wound man proceed strip parliamentary trooper lay own habiliment dress uniform enemy mount horse make haste place gain mile pull horse ride leisurely pace o'clock evening dark ride mile come small village dismount ale house put horse stable

50,"""Very true,"" said Grenville, giving the hostler a kick, and telling him to bestir himself, if he did not want his ears cropped.",true say give hostler kick tell bestir want ear croppe 
51,"They entered the ale-house, and soon found out they were held in great terror. They ordered every thing of the best to be produced, and threatened to set fire to the house if it was not; they turned the man and his wife out of their bed, and all three went to sleep in it; and, in short, they behaved in such an arbitrary manner, that nobody doubted that they were Cromwell's horse. In the morning they set off again by Chaloner's advice, paying for nothing that they had ordered, although they had all of them plenty of money. They now rode fast, inquiring at the places which they passed through, whether any fugitives had been seen, and, if they came to a town, inquiring, before they entered, whether there were any Parliamentary troops. So well did they manage, that after four days they had gained the skirts of the New Forest, and concealed themselves in a thicket till night-time, when Edward proposed that he should conduct his fellow-travelers to the cottage, where he would leave them till his plans were adjusted.",enter ale house find hold great terror order thing good produce threaten set fire house turn man wife bed go sleep short behave arbitrary manner doubt horse morning set advice pay order have plenty money ride inquire place pass fugitive see come town inquire enter be parliamentary troops manage day gain skirt new conceal thicket night time propose conduct fellow traveler cottage leave plan adjust 
52,"Edward had already arranged his plans. His great object was to ward off any suspicion of where he had been, and, of course, any idea that the intendant had been a party to his acts; and the fortunate change of his dress enabled him now to do so with success. He had decided to conduct his two friends to the cottage that night, and the next morning to ride over in his Parliamentary costume to the intendant's house, and bring the first news of the success of Cromwell and the defeat at Worcester; by which stratagem it would appear as if he had been with the Parliamentary, and not with the Jacobite, army.",arrange plan great object ward suspicion course idea intendant party act fortunate change dress enable do success decide conduct friend cottage night next morning ride parliamentary costume intendant house bring first news success defeat stratagem appear army 
53,"As they had traveled along, they found that the news of Cromwell's success had not yet arrived: in those times there was not the rapidity of communication that we now have, and Edward thought it very probable that he would be the first to communicate the intelligence to the intendant and those who resided near him.",travel find news success arrive time be rapidity communication have think probable first communicate intelligence intendant reside 
54,"As soon as it was dusk the three travelers left their retreat, and, guided by Edward, soon arrived at the cottage. Their appearance at first created no little consternation, for Humphrey and Pablo happened to be in the yard, when they heard the clattering of the swords and accouterments, and through the gloom observed, as they advanced, that the party were troopers. At first, Humphrey was for running on and barring the door; but, on a second reflection, he felt that he could not do a more imprudent thing if there was danger; and he therefore contented himself with hastily imparting the intelligence to his sisters, and then remaining at the threshold to meet the coming of the parties. The voice of Edward calling him by name dissipated all alarm, and in another minute he was in the arms of his brother and sisters.",dusk traveler leave retreat guide arrive cottage appearance create little consternation happen yard hear clattering sword accouterment gloom observe advance party trooper run barr door second reflection feel do imprudent thing be danger content impart intelligence sister remain threshold meet coming party voice call name dissipate alarm minute arm brother sister 
55,"""First, let us take our horses to the stables, Humphrey,"" said Edward, after the first greeting was over, ""and then we will come and partake of any thing that Alice can prepare for us, for we have not fared over well for the last three days.""",let take horse stable say first greeting come partake thing prepare fare last day 
56,"Accompanied by Humphrey and Pablo, they all went to the stables, and turned out the ponies to make room for the horses; and as soon as they were all fed and littered down, they returned to the cottage, and Chaloner and Grenville were introduced. Supper was soon on the table, and they were too hungry to talk while they were eating, so that but little information was gleaned from them that night. However, Humphrey ascertained that all was lost, and that they had escaped from the field previous to Alice and Edith leaving the room to prepare beds for the new-comers. When the beds were ready, Chaloner and Grenville retired, and then Edward remained half an hour with Humphrey, to communicate to him what had passed. Of course he could not enter into detail; but told him that he would get information from their new guests after he had left, which he must do early in the morning.",accompany go stable turn pony make room horse feed litter return cottage introduce supper table hungry talk eat little information glean night ascertain lose escape field previous leave room prepare bed new comer bed ready retire remain hour communicate pass course enter detail tell get information new guest leave do morning 
57,"""And now, Humphrey, my advice is this. My two friends can not remain in this cottage, for many reasons; but we have the key of Clara's cottage, and they can take up their lodging there, and we can supply them with all they want, until they find means of going abroad, which is their intention. I must be off to the intendant's to-morrow, and the day after I will come over to you. In the mean time, our guests can remain here, while you and Pablo prepare the cottage for them; and when I return every thing shall be settled, and we will conduct them to it. I do not think there is much danger of their being discovered while they remain there, certainly not so much as if they were here; for we must expect parties of troops in every direction now, as they were when the king's father made his escape from Hampton Court.

59,"The next morning, long before their guests were awake, Edward had been called by Humphrey, and found Pablo at the door with his horse. Edward, who had put on his Parliamentary accouterments, bade a hasty farewell to them, and set off across the forest to the house of the intendant, where he arrived before they had left their bedrooms. The first person he encountered was, very fortunately, Oswald, who was at his cottage door. Edward beckoned to him, being then about one hundred yards off; but Oswald did not recognize him at first, and advanced toward him in a very leisurely manner, to ascertain what the trooper might wish to inquire. But Edward called him Oswald, and that was sufficient. In a few words Edward told him how all was lost, and how he had escaped by changing clothes with one of the enemy.",next morning guest awake call find door horse put parliamentary accouterment bid hasty farewell set forest house intendant arrive leave bedroom first person encounter cottage door beckon yard recognize advance leisurely manner ascertain trooper wish inquire call sufficient few word tell lose escape change clothes enemy

63,"Edward put spurs to his horse, and arrived at the intendant's at full speed, making no small clattering in the yard below as he went in, much to the surprise of Sampson, who came out to ascertain what was the cause, and who was not a little surprised at perceiving Edward, who threw himself off the horse, and desiring Sampson to take it to the stable, entered the kitchen, and disturbed Phoebe, who was preparing breakfast.

69,"""You have done very prudently,"" replied the intendant, ""and you have probably saved me; at all events, you have warded off all suspicion, and those who are spies upon me will now have nothing to report, except to my favor. Your absence has been commented upon, and made known at high quarters, and suspicion has arisen in consequence. Your return as one of the Parliamentary forces will now put an end to all ill-natured remarks. My dear Edward, you have done me a service. As my secretary, and having been known to have been a follower of the Beverleys, your absence was considered strange, and it was intimated at high quarters that you had gone to join the king's forces, and that with my knowledge and consent. This I have from Langton; and it has in consequence injured me not a little: but now your appearance will make all right again. Now we will first to prayers, and then to breakfast; and after that we will have a more detailed account of what has taken place since your departure. Patience and Clara will not be sorry to recover their companion; but how they will like you in that dress I can not pretend to say.

Perhaps it may be better that we should suffer the infliction for a time, as for a time only can it be upheld, and it may be the cause of the king being more schooled and more fitted to reign than, by what you have told me in the course of your narrative, he at present appears to be.""",perceive present more do please time come monarch reseat throne present bow power tell opinion aim sovereignty obtain good suffer infliction time time upheld cause king school fit reign tell course narrative present appear
