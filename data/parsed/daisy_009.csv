4," The misfortunes of that day disheartened and disconcerted Etheldred. To do mischief where she most wished to do good, to grieve where she longed to comfort, seemed to be her fate; it was vain to attempt anything for anyone’s good, while all her warm feelings and high aspirations were thwarted by the awkward ungainly hands and heedless eyes that Nature had given her. Nor did the following day, Saturday, do much for her comfort, by giving her the company of her brothers. That it was Norman’s sixteenth birthday seemed only to make it worse. Their father had apparently forgotten it, and Norman stopped Blanche when she was going to put him in mind of it; stopped her by such a look as the child never forgot, though there was no anger in it. In reply to Ethel’s inquiry what he was going to do that morning, he gave a yawn and stretch, and said, dejectedly, that he had got some Euripides to look over, and some verses to finish.",misfortune day dishearten disconcert do mischief wish do good grieve long comfort seem fate vain attempt good warm feeling high aspiration thwart awkward ungainly hand heedless eye give follow day do much comfort give company brother sixteenth birthday seem make bad father forget stop go put mind stop look child forget be anger reply inquiry go do morning give yawn stretch say get look verse finish

16,"Dr. May was not come home; he had gone with Richard far into the country, and was to return to tea. He was thought to be desirous of avoiding the family dinners that used to be so delightful. Harry was impatient to depart, and when Mary and Tom ran after him, he ordered them back.",come go country return tea think desirous avoid family dinner use delightful impatient depart run order

29,"“I wish he would. We never have any fun now,” said Mary; “but oh! there he is,” as she spied Hector peeping over the gate which led from the field into the garden. It was the first time that he had been to Dr. May’s since his brother’s departure, and he was rather shy, but the joyful welcome of Mary and Tom took off all reluctance, and they claimed him for a good game at play in the wood-house. Mary ran upstairs to beg to be excused the formal walk, and, luckily for her, Miss Winter was in Margaret’s room. Margaret asked if it was very wet and dirty, and hearing “not very,” gave gracious permission, and off went Mary and Blanche to construct some curious specimens of pottery, under the superintendence of Hector and Tom. There was a certain ditch where yellow mud was attainable, whereof the happy children concocted marbles and vases, which underwent a preparatory baking in the boys’ pockets, that they might not crack in the nursery fire. Margaret only stipulated that her sisters should be well fenced in brown holland, and when Miss Winter looked grave, said, “Poor things, a little thorough play will do them a great deal of good.”",wish have fun say spy peep gate lead field garden first time brother departure shy joyful welcome take reluctance claim good game play wood house run beg excuse formal walk room ask wet dirty hear give gracious permission go construct curious specimen pottery superintendence be certain ditch yellow mud attainable happy child concoct marble vase underwent preparatory baking boy pocket crack nursery fire stipulate sister fence brown holland look grave say poor thing little thorough play do great deal good

31,"In the meantime, Norman had disconsolately returned to his Euripides, and Ethel, who wanted to stay with him and look out his words, was ordered out by Miss Winter, because she had spent all yesterday indoors. Miss Winter was going to stay with Margaret, and Ethel and Flora coaxed Norman to come with them, “just one mile on the turnpike road and back again; he would be much fresher for his Greek afterwards.”",meantime return want stay look word order spend yesterday go stay coax come mile road fresher 
32,"He came, but he did not enliven his sisters. The three plodded on, taking a diligent constitutional walk, exchanging very few words, and those chiefly between the girls. Flora gathered some hoary clematis, and red berries, and sought in the hedge-sides for some crimson “fairy baths” to carry home; and, at the sight of the amusement Margaret derived from the placing the beauteous little Pezizas in a saucer of damp green moss, so as to hide the brown sticks on which they grew, Ethel took shame to herself for want of perception of little attentions. When she told Norman so, he answered, “There’s no one who does see what is the right thing. How horrid the room looks! Everything is nohow!”  added he, looking round at the ornaments and things on the tables, which had lost their air of comfort and good taste. It was not disorder, and Ethel could not see what he meant. “What’s wrong?” said she.",come enlive sister plodd take diligent constitutional walk exchang few word girl gather hoary clematis red berries seek hedge side crimson fairy bath carry home sight amusement derive place beauteous little saucer damp green moss hide brown stick grow take shame want perception little attention tell answer be see right thing horrid room look nohow add look ornament thing table lose air comfort good taste disorder see mean wrong say

At last she found the article, and eagerly read him the description of the strange forms of the coral animals, and the beauties of their flower-like feelers and branching fabrics. It would once have delighted him, but his first comment was, “Nasty little brutes!”  However, the next minute he thanked her, took the book, and said he could hammer something out of it, though it was too bad to give such an unclassical subject. At dusk he left off, saying he should get it done at night, his senses would come then, and he should be glad to sit up.",rest sofa sister rummage chiffonier last find article read description strange form coral animal beauty flower feeler branching fabric delight first comment nasty little brute next minute thank take book say hammer bad give unclassical subject dusk leave say get do night sense come glad sit

Don’t you remember the beautiful perspective drawing she made of this room for me to take to Oxford?

He stood over her, counted her shovelfuls of tea, and watched the water into the teapot--he superintended her warming the cups, and putting a drop into each saucer. “Ah!” said Ethel, with a concluding sigh, “it makes one hotter than double equations!”",let stand count shovelful tea watch water teapot superintend warm cup put drop saucer say conclude sigh make hot double equation 
81,"It was all right, as Flora allowed with a slightly superior smile. She thought Richard would never succeed in making a notable or elegant woman of Ethel, and it was best that the two sisters should take different lines. Flora knew that, though clever and with more accomplishments, she could not surpass Ethel in intellectual attainments, but she was certainly far more valuable in the house, and had been proved to have just the qualities in which her sister was most deficient. She did not relish hearing that Ethel wanted nothing but attention to be more than her equal, and she thought Richard mistaken. Flora’s remembrance of their time of distress was less unmixedly wretched than it was with the others, for she knew she had done wonders.",right allow superior smile think succeed make notable elegant woman good sister take different line know clever more accomplishment surpass intellectual attainment valuable house prove have quality sister deficient relish hearing want attention more equal think mistaken remembrance time distress wretched other know do wonder 
82,"The next day Norman told Ethel that he had got on very well with the verses, and finished them off late at night. He showed them to her before taking them to school on Monday morning, and Ethel thought they were the best he had ever written. There was too much spirit and poetical beauty for a mere schoolboy task, and she begged for the foul copy to show it to her father. “I have not got it,” said Norman. “The foul copy was not like these; but when I was writing them out quite late, it was all I don’t know how. Flora’s music was in my ears, and the room seemed to get larger, and like an ocean cave; and when the candle flickered, ‘twas like the green glowing light of the sun through the waves.”",next day tell get verse finish night show take school morning think good write be much spirit poetical beauty mere schoolboy task begg foul copy show father get say foul copy write know music ear room seem get large ocean cave candle flicker twat green glow light sun wave

Harry, come along.”",shiver get head much ear sing roaring sea think foot freeze iceberg come darkness sea monster drown horrid face express more say quarter go say long yawn rub eye sure right come 
89,"Ethel thought those verses ought to make a sensation, but all that came of them was a Quam optime, and when she asked Norman if no special notice had been taken of them, he said, in his languid way, “No; only Dr. Hoxton said they were better than usual.”",think verse make sensation come quam optime ask special notice take say languid way say good usual

He really sometimes makes very striking verses.”",have satisfaction hear happen meet say boy have more poet come way make striking verse 
91,"Richard watched for an opportunity of speaking to Harry, which did not at once occur, as the boy spent very little of his time at home, and, as if by tacit consent, he and Norman came in later every evening. At last, on Thursday, in the additional two hours’ leisure allowed to the boys, when the studious prepared their tasks, and the idle had some special diversion, Richard encountered him running up to his own room to fetch a newly-invented instrument for projecting stones.",watch opportunity speak occur boy spend little time home tacit consent come evening last additional hour leisure allow boy studious prepare task idle have special diversion encounter run own room fetch invent instrument project stone

95,"The awe-struck, shy, yet sorrowful look on his rosy face showed preparation enough, and Richard’s only preface was to say, “It is a bit of a letter that she was in course of writing to Aunt Flora, a description of us all. The letter itself is gone, but here is a copy of it. I thought you would like to read what relates to yourself.”",awe strike shy sorrowful look rosy face show preparation preface say bit letter course writing description letter gone copy think like read relate

She was full of asseverations that they should go; she took them to church sometimes herself, when it was fine weather and they had clothes, and they could say their catechiz as well as anybody already; yes, they should come, that they should, and next Sunday. Ethel promised to be there to introduce them to the chief lady, the president of the Committee, Mrs. Ledwich, and, with a profusion of thanks, they took leave.",few moment make appearance rough ragged compel grandmother duck way courtesy finger mouth stand shy show delight garment unfold granny talk bring stipulation frock wear school church mild steady way bring old woman listen full asseveration go take church fine weather have clothes say catechiz come next promise introduce chief lady president profusion thanks take leave

It seemed to be a great relief that they were not come to complain of Lucy, and there were many looks of surprise on hearing what their business really was. Mrs. Taylor thanked them, and appeared not to know whether she was glad or sorry; and her husband, pipe in hand, gazed at the young gentleman as if he did not comprehend the species, since he could not be old enough to be a clergyman.",find come hospital look weak ill smoke pipe fire wife bustle great rate infant cry seem great relief come complain be many look surprise hear business thank appear know glad sorry husband pipe hand gaze young gentleman comprehend species old clergyman

112,"“I believe you will be glad of it,” said Richard; and he went on to speak of the elder children coming to school on Sunday, thus causing another whining from the wife about distance and bad weather, and no one else going that way. He said the little Halls were coming, but Mrs. Taylor begun saying she disliked their company for the children--granny let them get about so much, and they said bad words. The father again interfered. Perhaps Mr. Wilmot, who acted as chaplain at the hospital, had been talking to him, for he declared at once that they should come; and Richard suggested that he might see them home when he came from church; then, turning to the boy and girl, told them they would meet their sister Lucy, and asked them if they would not like that.",believe glad say go speak elder child come school cause whining wife distance bad weather else go way say little hall come begin say dislike company child granny let get much say bad word father interfer act chaplain hospital talk declare come suggest see come church turn boy girl tell meet sister ask like 
113,"On the whole, the beginning was not inauspicious, though there might be a doubt whether old Mrs. Hall would keep all her promises. Ethel was so much diverted and pleased as to be convinced she would; Richard was a little doubtful as to her power over the wild girls. There could not be any doubt that John Taylor was in earnest, and had been worked upon just at the right moment; but there was danger that the impression would not last. “And his wife is such a horrible whining dawdle!” said Ethel--“there will be no good to be done if it depends on her.”",whole beginning inauspicious be doubt old keep promise divert pleased convince little doubtful power wild girl be doubt earnest work right moment be danger impression last wife horrible whining dawdle say be good do depend
