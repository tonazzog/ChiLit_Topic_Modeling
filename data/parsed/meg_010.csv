2,"Meg and her children did not fail to make their appearance the next morning at Mrs Blossom's shop, where she welcomed them heartily, and made them comfortable again by the kitchen fire.  When they were well warmed, and had finished some bread, and some coffee which had been kept hot for them, Mrs Blossom put on a serious business air.",child fail make appearance next morning shop welcome make comfortable kitchen fire warm finish bread coffee keep hot put serious business air

7,"'I'm not a rich woman,' resumed Mrs Blossom, 'and Mr George has his old father to keep, as lives down in my own village, and I know him well; so we can't give great wages.  I'd give you a half-quartern loaf a day, and Mr George threepence for the present, while it's winter.  Would that suit your views?'",rich woman resume have old father keep live own village know give great wage give half quartern loaf day threepence present winter suit view

9,'Couldn't you leave 'em with a neighbour?' suggested Mrs Blossom.,leave neighbour suggest 
10,"Meg pondered deeply for a while.  Kitty had told her the night before that she had got some sailors' shirts to sew, and would stay at home to make them.  She could trust Robin and the baby with Kitty, and instead of lighting a fire in her own attic she could give her the coals, and so save her fuel, as part payment for taking charge of the children. Yet Meg felt a little sad at the idea of leaving them for so long a time, and seeing so little of them each day, and she knew they would miss her sorely.  But nothing else could be done, and she accepted Mrs Blossom's offer thankfully.",ponder while tell night get sailor shirt sew stay home make trust baby light fire own attic give coal save fuel part payment take charge child feel little sad idea leave time see little day know miss else do accept offer 
11,"'You needn't be here afore nine o' the morning,' said Mrs Blossom; 'it's too early for Posy to be passing by; and you can go away again as soon as it's dark in the evening.  You mustn't get any breakfast, you know, because that's in our bargain; and I'd never grudge you a meal's meat for the children either, bless 'em!  They shall come and have a good tea with us sometimes, they shall--specially on Sundays, when Mr George is at home; and if you'd only got your clothes out o' pawn, we'd all go to church together.  But we'll see, we'll see.'",morning say early pass go dark evening get breakfast know bargain grudge meal meat child bless come have good tea home get clothes pawn go church see see 
12,"Meg entered upon her new duties the next morning, after committing the children, with many lingering kisses and last good-byes, into Kitty's charge, who promised faithfully to be as kind to them as Meg herself. If it had not been for her anxiety with regard to them, she would have enjoyed nothing better than being Mrs Blossom's little maid.  The good woman was so kindly and motherly that she won Meg's whole heart; and to see her sit by the shop window, knitting a very large long stocking for Mr George, but with her eyes scanning every woman's face that went by, made her feel full of an intense and childish interest.  She began herself to watch for Posy, as her mother described her; and whenever the form of a grown-up girl darkened the doorway, she held her breath to listen if Mrs Blossom called her by that pet name.  Mr George also was very good to Meg in his bluff way, and bought her a pair of nearly new shoes with his first week's wages, over and above the threepence a day which he paid her.  With Mrs Blossom she held many a conversation about the lost girl, who had grown up wicked, and was therefore worse than dead; and before long Mr George observed that Meg had done her a world of good.",enter new duty next morning commit child many linger kisse last good by charge promise kind anxiety regard enjoy good little maid good woman motherly win whole heart see sit shop window knitting large long stock eye scan woman face go make feel full intense childish interest begin watch mother describe form grow girl darken doorway hold breath listen call pet name good bluff way buy pair new shoe first week wage threepence day pay hold many conversation lose girl grow wicked bad dead long observe do world good 
13,"Christmas Day was a great treat to Meg; for though Mr George went down into the country to see his old father, Mrs Blossom invited her and the children to come to dinner, and to stay with her till it was the little ones' bedtime.  When they sat round the fire in the afternoon she told them wonderful stories about the country--of its fields, and gardens, and lanes.",great treat go country see old father invite child come dinner stay little one bedtime sit fire afternoon tell wonderful story country field garden lane

17,"'Rosemary Lane!' repeated Mrs Blossom.  'Why, the lanes in the country are nothing like the lanes in London.  They're beautiful roads, with tall trees growing all along 'em, and meeting one another overhead; and there are roses and honeysuckles all about the hedges, and birds singing, and the sun shining.  Only you don't know anything about roses, and honeysuckles, and birds.'",repeat lane country lane beautiful road tall tree grow meet be rose honeysuckle hedge bird sing sun shine know rose honeysuckle bird

22,"Robin asked no more questions, and Mrs Blossom was glad to talk of something else.  It was a very happy day altogether, but it came too quickly to an end.  Meg wrapped up her children well before turning out into the cold streets, and Mrs Blossom gave them a farewell kiss each, with two to Meg because she was such a comfort to her.",ask more question glad talk else happy day come end wrap child turn cold street give farewell kiss comfort 
23,"When they reached their own attic they heard Kitty call to them, and Meg opened her door.  She was sitting without any fire, stitching away as for her life at a coarse striped shirt, lighted only by a small farthing candle; but she laid down her task for a minute, and raised her thin pale face, and her eyes half blinded with tears and hard work.",reach own attic hear call open door sit fire stitch life coarse stripe shirt light small farthing candle lay task minute raise thin pale face eye half blind tear hard work

38,"Kitty threw down her work, and clasped Meg strongly in her arms, pressing down Meg's head upon her breast, and crying, 'Oh, my dear little Meg!  My good little Meg!'  Then she put them all three gently out of her room, and bade them good-night and God bless them, in a husky and tremulous voice.",throw work clasp arm press head breast cry dear little good little put room bid good night bless husky tremulous voice
