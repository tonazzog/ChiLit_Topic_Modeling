1,CHAPTER 48. DARK DAYS.,dark day 
2,"A whole week had passed, and there were no tidings whatever of little Nan or of Annie Forest.  No one at Lavender House had heard a word about them; the police came and went, detectives even arrived from London, but there were no traces whatever of the missing children.",whole week pass be tiding little hear word police come go detective arrive be trace missing child 
3,"The Midsummer holiday was now close at hand, but no one spoke of it or thought of it.  Mrs Willis told the teachers that the prizes should be distributed, but she said she could invite no guests and could allow of no special festivities.  Miss Danesbury and Miss Good repeated her words to the school-girls, who answered without hesitation that they did not wish for feasting and merriment; they would rather the day passed unnoticed.  In truth, the fact that their baby was gone, that their favourite and prettiest and brightest school-mate had also disappeared, caused such gloom, such distress, such apprehension that even the most thoughtless of those girls could scarcely have laughed or been merry. School-hours were still kept after a fashion, but there was no life in the lessons.  In truth, it seemed as if the sun would never shine again at Lavender House.",holiday close hand speak think tell teacher prize distribute say invite guest allow special festivity repeat word school girl answer hesitation wish feasting merriment rather day pass unnoticed truth fact baby gone favourite prettiest brightest school mate disappear cause such gloom such distress such apprehension thoughtless girl laugh merry school hour keep fashion be life lesson truth seem sun shine 
4,"Hester was ill; not very ill--she had no fever, she had no cold; she had, as the good doctor explained it, nothing at all wrong, except that her nervous system had got a shock.",ill ill have fever have cold good doctor explain wrong nervous system get shock 
5,"""When the little one is found, Miss Hetty will be quite well again,"" said the good doctor: but the little one had not been found yet, and Hester had completely broken down.  She lay on her bed, saying little or nothing, eating scarcely anything, sleeping not at all.  All the girls were kind to her, and each one in the school took turns in trying to comfort her; but no one could win a smile from Hester, and even Mrs Willis failed utterly to reach or touch her heart.",little one find say good doctor little one find break lay bed say little eat sleep girl kind one school take turn try comfort win smile fail reach touch heart 
6,"Mr Everard came once to see her, but he had scarcely spoken many words when Hester broke into an agony of weeping, and begged him to go away. He shook his head when he left her, and said sadly to himself--",come see speak many word break agony weep begg go shake head leave say 
7,"""That girl has got something on her mind; she is grieving for more than the loss of her little sister.""",girl get mind grieve more loss little sister 
8,"The twentieth of June came at last, and the girls sat about in groups in the pleasant, shady garden, and talked of the very sad breaking-up day they were to have on the morrow, and wondered if, when they returned to school again, Annie and little Nan would have been found.  Cecil Temple, Dora Russell, and one or two others were sitting together, and whispering in low voices.  Mary Price joined them, and said anxiously--",twentieth come last girl sit group pleasant shady garden talk sad breaking day have morrow wonder return school little find other sit whisper low voice join say 
9,"""I don't think the doctor is satisfied about Hester.  Perhaps I ought not to have listened, but I heard him talking to Miss Danesbury just now; he said she must be got to sleep somehow, and she is to have a composing draught to-night.""",think doctor satisfied listen hear talk say get sleep have compose draught night

11,"""Have you been praying about it, Cecil?"" asked Mary, kneeling on the grass, laying her elbows on Cecil's knees, and looking into her face. ""Do you say this because you have faith?""",pray ask kneel grass lay elbow knee look face say have faith 
12,"""I have prayed, and I have faith,"" replied Cecil in her simple, earnest way.  ""Why, Dora, what is the matter?""",pray have faith reply simple earnest way matter 
13,"""Only that it's horrid to leave like this,"" said Dora; ""I--I thought my last day at school would have been so different, and somehow I am sorry I spoke so much against that poor little Annie.""",horrid leave say think last day school different sorry speak poor little

15,"""Thank you, Dora,"" she said with fervour; ""I love you for those words.""",thank say fervour love word 
16,"""Here comes Susy,"" remarked Mary Price.  ""I really don't think _anything_ would move Susy; she's just as stolid and indifferent as ever.  Ah, Susy, here's a place for you--oh, what _is_ the matter with Phyllis? see how she's rushing toward us!  Phyllis, my dear, don't break your neck.""",come remark think move stolid indifferent place matter see rush dear break neck 
17,"Susan, with her usual nonchalance, seated herself by Dora Russell's side.  Phyllis burst excitedly into the group.",usual nonchalance seat side burst group 
18,"""I think,"" she exclaimed, ""I really, really do think that news has come of Annie's father.  Nora said that Janet told her that a foreign letter came this morning to Mrs Willis, and somebody saw Mrs Willis talking to Miss Danesbury--oh, I forgot, only I know that the girls of the school are whispering the news that Mrs Willis cried, and Miss Danesbury said, `After waiting for him four years, and now, when he comes back, he won't find her!'  Oh, dear, oh, dear! there is Danesbury. Cecil, darling love, go to her, and find out the truth.""",think exclaim think news come father say tell foreign letter come morning see talk forget know girl school whisper news cry say wait year come find dear be darling love go find truth

20,"""It is true,"" she said sadly; ""there came a letter this morning from Captain Forest; he will be at Lavender House in a week.  Miss Danesbury says it is a wonderful letter, and he has been shipwrecked, and on an island by himself for ever so long; but he is safe now, and will soon be in England.  Miss Danesbury says Mrs Willis can scarcely speak about that letter; she is in great, great trouble, and Miss Danesbury confesses that they are all more anxious than they dare to admit about Annie and little Nan.""",true say come letter morning week say wonderful letter shipwreck island safe say speak letter great great trouble confess anxious dare admit little 
21,"At this moment the sound of carriage wheels was heard on the drive, and Susan, peering forward to see who was arriving, remarked in her usual nonchalant manner--",moment sound carriage wheel hear drive peer see arrive remark usual nonchalant manner

24,"From where they sat they could see the basket-carriage waiting at the front entrance--the little ladies had gone inside, all was perfect silence and stillness.",sit see basket carriage wait front entrance little lady go perfect silence stillness 
25,"Suddenly on the stillness a sound broke--the sound of a girl running quickly; nearer and nearer came the steps, and the four or five who sat together under the oak-tree noticed the quick panting breath, and felt even before a word was uttered that evil tidings were coming to them. They all started to their feet, however; they all uttered a cry of horror and distress when Hester herself broke into their midst.  She was supposed to be lying down in a darkened room, she was supposed to be very ill--what was she doing here?",stillness sound break sound girl run come step sit oak tree notice quick panting breath feel word utter evil tiding come start foot utter cry horror distress break midst suppose lie darken room suppose ill do
