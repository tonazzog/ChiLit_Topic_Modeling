1,CHAPTER 1. Leaving Home.,chapter leave 
2," A lady in deep mourning was sitting, crying bitterly, by a fire in small lodgings in the town of Yarmouth. Beside her stood a tall lad of sixteen. He was slight in build, but his schoolfellows knew that Charlie Marryat's muscles were as firm and hard as those of any boy in the school. In all sports requiring activity and endurance, rather than weight and strength, he was always conspicuous. Not one in the school could compete with him in long-distance running, and when he was one of the hares there was but little chance for the hounds. He was a capital swimmer, and one of the best boxers in the school. He had a reputation for being a leader in every mischievous prank; but he was honorable and manly, would scorn to shelter himself under the semblance of a lie, and was a prime favourite with his masters, as well as his schoolfellows. His mother bewailed the frequency with which he returned home with blackened eyes and bruised face; for between Dr. Willet's school and the fisher lads of Yarmouth there was a standing feud, whose origin dated so far back that none of those now at school could trace it. Consequently, fierce fights often took place in the narrow rows, and sometimes the fisher boys would be driven back on to the broad quay shaded by trees, by the river, and there being reinforced from the craft along the side, would reassume the offensive and drive their opponents back into the main street.",lady deep mourn sit cry fire small lodging town stand tall lad slight build schoolfellow know muscle firm hard boy school sport require activity endurance weight strength conspicuous school compete long distance running hare little chance hound capital swimmer good boxer school have reputation leader mischievous prank honorable manly scorn shelter semblance lie prime favourite master schoolfellow mother bewail frequency return blacken eye bruise face school fisher lad be standing feud origin date school trace fierce fight take place narrow row fisher boy drive broad quay shade tree river reinforce craft side reassume offensive drive opponent main street 
3,"It was but six months since Charlie had lost his father, who was the officer in command at the coast guard station, and his scanty pension was now all that remained for the support of his widow and children. His mother had talked his future prospects over, many times, with Charlie. The latter was willing to do anything, but could suggest nothing. His father had but little naval interest, and had for years been employed on coast guard service. Charlie agreed that, although he should have liked of all things to go to sea, it was useless to think of it now, for he was past the age at which he could have entered as a midshipman.",month lose father officer command coast guard station scanty pension remain support widow child mother talk future prospect many time latter willing do suggest father have little naval interest year employ coast guard service agree like thing go sea useless think age enter midshipman 
4,"The matter had been talked over four years before, with his father; but the latter had pointed out that a life in the navy, without interest, is in most cases a very hard one. If a chance of distinguishing himself happened, promotion would follow; but if not, he might be for years on shore, starving on half pay and waiting in vain for an appointment, while officers with more luck and better interest went over his head.",matter talk year father latter point life navy interest most case hard one chance distinguish happen promotion follow year shore starve half pay wait vain appointment officer more luck good interest go head 
5,"Other professions had been discussed, but nothing determined upon, when Lieutenant Marryat suddenly died. Charlie, although an only son, was not an only child, as he had two sisters both younger than himself. After a few months of effort, Mrs. Marryat found that the utmost she could hope to do, with her scanty income, was to maintain herself and daughters, and to educate them until they should reach an age when they could earn their own living as governesses; but that Charlie's keep and education were beyond her resources. She had, therefore, very reluctantly written to an uncle, whom she had not seen for many years, her family having objected very strongly to her marriage with a penniless lieutenant in the navy. She informed him of the loss of her husband, and that, although her income was sufficient to maintain herself and her daughters, she was most anxious to start her son, who was now sixteen, in life; and therefore begged him to use his influence to obtain for him a situation of some sort. The letter which she now held in her hand was the answer to the appeal.",other profession discuss determine die only son only child have sister young few month effort find utmost hope do scanty income maintain daughter educate reach age earn own living governess keep education resource write uncle see many year family object marriage penniless lieutenant navy inform loss husband income sufficient maintain daughter anxious start son life begg use influence obtain situation sort letter hold hand answer appeal 
6,"""My dear Niece,"" it began, ""Since you, by your own foolish conduct and opposition to all our wishes, separated yourself from your family, and went your own way in life, I have heard little of you, as the death of your parents so shortly afterwards deprived me of all sources of information. I regret to hear of the loss which you have suffered. I have already taken the necessary steps to carry out your wishes. I yesterday dined with a friend, who is one of the directors of the Honorable East India Company, and at my request he has kindly placed a writership in the Company at your son's service. He will have to come up to London to see the board, next week, and will probably have to embark for India a fortnight later. I shall be glad if he will take up his abode with me, during the intervening time. I shall be glad also if you will favour me with a statement of your income and expenses, with such details as you may think necessary. I inclose four five-pound bank notes, in order that your son may obtain such garments as may be immediately needful for his appearance before the board of directors, and for his journey to London. I remain, my dear niece, yours sincerely,",dear begin own foolish conduct opposition wish separate family go own way life hear little death parent deprive source information regret hear loss suffer take necessary step carry wish yesterday dine friend director honorable request place writership company son service have come see board next week have embark fortnight glad take abode intervene time glad favour statement income expense such detail think necessary inclose pound bank note order son obtain such garment needful appearance board director journey remain dear niece

9,"""Not so bad as that, Mother, I hope,"" Charlie said sympathizingly, although he could not repress a smile; ""other people have managed to live out there, and have come back safe.""",bad mother hope say repress smile other person manage live come safe 
10,"""Yes,"" Mrs. Marryat said, sobbing; ""I know how you will come back. A little, yellow, shrivelled up old man with no liver, and a dreadful temper, and a black servant. I know what it will be.""",say sobb know come little yellow shrivell old man liver dreadful temper black servant know 
11,This time Charlie could not help laughing.,time help laugh 
12,"""That's looking too far ahead altogether, Mother. You take the two extremes. If I don't die in a fortnight, I am to live to be a shrivelled old man. I'd rather take a happy medium, and look forward to coming back before my liver is all gone, or my temper all destroyed, with lots of money to make you and the girls comfortable.",look mother take extreme die fortnight live shrivell old man take happy medium look come liver gone temper destroy lot money make girl comfortable 
13,"""There is only one thing. I wish it had been a cadetship, instead of a writership.""",be thing wish cadetship writership 
14,"""That is my only comfort,"" Mrs. Marryat said. ""If it had been a cadetship, I should have written to say that I would not let you go. It is bad enough as it is; but if you had had to fight, I could not have borne it.""",only comfort say cadetship write say let go bad have fight borne 
15,"Charlie did his best to console his mother, by telling her how everyone who went to India made fortunes, and how he should be sure to come back with plenty of money; and that, when the girls grew up, he should be able to find rich husbands for them; and at last he succeeded in getting her to look at matters in a less gloomy light.",do good console mother tell go make fortune sure come plenty money girl grow able find rich husband last succeed get look matter gloomy light 
16,"""And I'm sure, Mother,"" he said, ""Uncle means most kindly. He sends twenty pounds, you see, and says that that is for immediate necessities; so I have no doubt he means to help to get my outfit, or at any rate to advance money, which I can repay him out of my salary. The letter is rather stiff and businesslike, of course, but I suppose that's his way; and you see he asks about your income, so perhaps he means to help for the girls' education. I should go away very happy, if I knew that you would be able to get on comfortably. Of course it's a long way off, Mother, and I should have liked to stay at home, to be a help to you and the girls; but one can't have all one wishes. As far as I am concerned, myself, I would rather go out as a writer there, where I shall see strange sights and a strange country, than be stuck all my life at a desk in London.",sure mother say uncle mean most send pound see say immediate necessity have doubt mean help get outfit rate advance money repay salary letter stiff businesslike course suppose way see ask income mean help girl education go happy know able get course long way mother like stay home help girl have wish concerned go writer see strange sight strange country stick life desk 
17,"""What is Uncle like?""",uncle 
18,"""He is a short man, my dear, rather stiff and pompous, with a very stiff cravat. He used to give me his finger to shake, when I was a child, and I was always afraid of him. He married a most disagreeable woman, only a year or two before I married, myself. But I heard she died not very long afterwards;"" and so Mrs. Marryat got talking of her early days and relations, and was quite in good spirits again, by the time her daughters returned from school; and she told them what she was now coming to regard as the good fortune which had befallen their brother.",short man dear stiff pompous stiff cravat use give finger shake child afraid marry disagreeable woman year marry hear die get talk early day relation good spirit time daughter return school tell come regard good fortune befall brother 
19,"The girls were greatly affected. They adored their brother, and the thought that he was going away for years was terrible to them. Nothing that could be said pacified them in the slightest degree, and they did nothing but cry, until they retired to bed. Charlie was much affected by their sorrow; but when they had retired, he took his hat and went out to tell the news of his approaching departure to some of his chums.",girl affect adore brother thought go year terrible say pacify slight degree do cry retire bed affect sorrow retire take hat go tell news approach departure chum 
20,"The next day, Mrs. Marryat wrote thanking her uncle for his kindness, and saying that Charlie would go round to London by the packet which sailed on the following Monday; and would, if the wind were fair and all went well, reach London on the Wednesday.",next day write thank uncle kindness say go packet sail follow wind fair go reach 
21,"School was, of course, at once given up, and the girls also had a holiday till their brother's departure. When the necessary clothes were ordered, there was little more to do; and Charlie spent the time, when his boy friends were in school, in walking with the girls along the shore, talking to them of the future, of the presents he would send them home, and of the life he should lead in India; while at other times he went out with his favourite schoolfellows, and joined in one last grand battle with the smack boys.",school course give girl have holiday brother departure necessary clothes order be little more do spend time boy friend school walk girl shore talk future present send life lead other time go favourite schoolfellow join last grand battle smack boy 
22,"On Monday morning, after a sad farewell to his family, Charlie embarked on board the Yarmouth Belle, a packet which performed the journey to and from London once a fortnight. She was a roomy lugger, built for stowage rather than speed, and her hold was crammed and her deck piled with packages of salted fish. There were five or six other persons also bound for London, the journey to which was, in those days, regarded as an arduous undertaking.",morning sad farewell family embark board packet perform journey fortnight roomy lugger build stowage speed hold cramm deck pile package salt fish be other person bind journey day regard arduous undertaking 
23,"As soon as the Yarmouth Belle issued from the mouth of the river, she began to pitch heavily; and Charlie, who from frequently going out with his father in the revenue cutter, was a good sailor, busied himself in doing his best for his afflicted fellow passengers. Towards evening the wind got up, and shifting ahead, the captain dropped anchor off Lowestoft. The next morning was finer, and the Yarmouth Belle continued her way. It was not, however, till Thursday afternoon that she dropped anchor in the Pool.",issue mouth river begin pitch go father revenue cutter good sailor busy do good afflict fellow passenger evening wind get shift captain drop anchor next morning finer continue way afternoon drop anchor 
24,"Charlie was soon on shore, and giving his trunk to a porter, desired him to lead the way to Bread Street, in which his uncle resided; for in the last century, such things as country villas were almost unknown, and the merchants of London for the most part resided in the houses where they carried on their business. Keeping close to the porter, to see that he did not make off with his trunk, for Charlie had received many warnings as to the extreme wickedness of London, he followed him through the busy streets, and arrived safely at his uncle's door.",shore give trunk porter desire lead way uncle reside last century such thing country villa unknown merchant most part reside house carry business keep porter see make trunk receive many warning extreme wickedness follow busy street arrive uncle door 
25,"It was now dusk, and Charlie, on giving his name, was shown upstairs to a large room, which was lighted by a fire blazing in the hearth. Standing with his back to this was a gentleman whom he at once recognized, from his mother's description, as her uncle, although he was a good deal more portly than when she had seen him last.",dusk give name show large room light fire blaze hearth stand back gentleman recognize mother description uncle good deal portly see last 
26,"""So you are my grandnephew,"" he said, holding out what Charlie considered to be a very limp and flabby hand towards him.",grandnephew say hold consider limp flabby hand 
27,"""Yes, Uncle,"" Charlie said cheerfully; ""and we are very much obliged to you, Mamma and I, for your kindness.""",say oblige kindness 
28,"""Humph!"" the old gentleman grunted.",old gentleman grunt 
29,"""And how is it,"" he asked severely, ""that you were not here yesterday? My niece's letter led me to expect that you would arrive yesterday.""",ask yesterday niece letter lead expect arrive yesterday 
30,"""We came as fast as we could, Uncle,"" Charlie laughed; ""but of course the time depends upon the wind. The captain tells me that he has been as much as three weeks coming round.""",come laugh course time depend wind captain tell much week come 
31,Mr. Tufton grunted again as if to signify that such unpunctuality was altogether displeasing to him.,grunt signify such unpunctuality displeasing 
32,"""You are tall,"" he said, looking up at Charlie, who stood half a head above him, ""and thin, very thin. You have a loose way of standing, which I don't approve of.""",tall say look stand head thin thin have loose way standing approve 
33,"""I'm sorry I'm loose, sir,"" Charlie said gravely, ""if you do not approve of it; but you see, running about and playing games make one lissome. I suppose, now that's all over and I am going to spend my time in writing, I shall get stiffer.""",sorry loose sir say approve see run play game make lissome suppose go spend time writing get stiffer 
34,"""I hope so, I hope so,"" Mr. Tufton said encouragingly, and as if stiffness were one of the most desirable things in life. ""I like to see young men with a sedate bearing.",hope hope say stiffness desirable thing life like see young man sedate bear 
35,"""And you left my niece and grandnieces well, I hope?""",leave niece grandniece hope 
36,"""Quite well, thank you, sir,"" Charlie said; ""but, of course, a good deal upset with parting from me.""",thank sir say course good deal upset parting 
37,"""Yes,"" Mr. Tufton said; ""I suppose so. Women are so emotional. Now there's nothing I object to more than emotion.""",say suppose woman emotional be object more emotion 
38,"As Charlie thought that this was probably the case, he was silent, although the idea vaguely occurred to him that he should like to excite a little emotion in his uncle, by the sudden insertion of a pin, or some other such means. The silence continued for some little time, and then Mr. Tufton said:",think case silent idea occur like excite little emotion uncle sudden insertion pin other such means silence continue little time say 
39,"""I always dine at two o'clock; but as probably you are hungry--I have observed that boys always are hungry--some food will be served you in the next room. I had already given my housekeeper orders. No doubt you will find it prepared. After that, you may like to take a walk in the streets. I have supper at nine, by which hour you will, of course, have returned.""",dine o'clock hungry observe boy hungry food serve next room give housekeeper order find prepare like take walk street have supper hour course return 
40,"Charlie, as he ate his meal, thought to himself that his uncle was a pompous old gentleman, and that it would be very hard work getting on with him, for the next three weeks. However, he consoled himself by the thought:",eat meal think uncle pompous old gentleman hard work get next week console thought 
41,"""Kind is as kind does after all, and I expect the old gentleman is not as crusty as he looks.""",kind kind expect old gentleman crusty look 
42,"Charlie had handed to Mr. Tufton a letter which his mother had given him, and when he returned from a ramble through the streets, he found that gentleman sitting by the fire, with lights upon a small table beside him. Upon this Mrs. Marryat's letter lay open.",hand letter mother give return ramble street find gentleman sit fire light small table letter lay open 
43,"""So you have soon become tired of the streets of London, Grandnephew!"" he said.",become tired street say 
44,"""There is not much to see, sir. The lamps do not burn very brightly, and the fog is coming on. I thought that, if it grew thicker, I might lose my way, and in that case I might not have been in at the hour you named for supper.""",be much see sir lamp burn fog come think grow thick lose way case hour name supper 
45,"""Humph!"" the other gentleman grunted. ""So your mother has taught you to be punctual to meals. But, no; boys' appetites teach them to be punctual then, if never at any other time.",other gentleman grunt mother teach punctual meal boy appetite teach punctual other time 
46,"""And why, sir?"" he asked severely, ""Did my niece not write to me before?""",sir ask niece write 
47,"""I don't know, sir,"" Charlie said. ""I suppose she did not like--that is, she didn't think--that is--""",know sir say suppose like think 
48,"""Think, sir! Like, sir!"" said his uncle. ""What right had she either to think or to like? Her duty clearly was to have made me acquainted, at once, with all the circumstances. I suppose I had a right to say whether I approved of my grandnieces going tramping about the world as governesses, or not. It isn't because a woman chooses, by her folly, to separate herself from her family, that they are to be deprived of their rights in a matter of this kind. Eh, sir, what do you say to that?"" and Mr. Tufton looked very angry, indeed.",think sir sir say uncle right have think like duty make acquainted circumstance suppose have right say approve grandniece go tramp world governess woman choose folly separate family deprive right matter kind sir say look angry

50,"""Why, sir, suppose she had made you a tinker, sir, and you turned out a thief, as likely as not you would have done, and you'd been hung, sir, what then? Am I to have such discredit as this brought upon me, without my having any option in the matter?""",sir suppose make tinker sir turn thief likely do hang sir have such discredit bring have option matter 
51,"""I suppose not, sir,"" Charlie said. ""I hope I shouldn't have turned out a thief, even if I'd been a tinker; but perhaps it was because my mother feared that this might be the case, that she did give you the option.""",suppose sir say hope turn thief tinker mother fear case give option 
52,"His uncle looked at him keenly; but Charlie, though with some difficulty, maintained the gravest face.",uncle look difficulty maintain gravest face 
53,"""It is well she did so,"" Mr. Tufton said; ""very well. If she had not done so, I should have known the reason why. And you, sir, do you like the thought of going to India?""",do say do know reason sir like thought go 
54,"""Yes, Uncle, I like the thought very much, though I would rather, if I may say so, have gone as a cadet.""",like thought say go cadet 
55,"""I thought so,"" Mr. Tufton said, sarcastically. ""I was sure of it. You wanted to wear a red coat and a sword, and to swagger about the streets of Calcutta, instead of making an honorable living and acquiring a fortune.""",think say sure want wear red coat sword swagger street make honorable living acquire fortune 
56,"""I don't think, sir,"" Charlie said, ""that the idea of the red coat and sword entered into my mind; but it seemed to me the choice of a life of activity and adventure, against one as a mere clerk.""",think sir say idea red coat sword enter mind seem choice life activity adventure mere clerk 
57,"""Had you entered the military service of the Company, even if you didn't get shot, you could only hope to rise to the command of a regiment, ranking with a civilian very low down on the list. The stupidity of boys is unaccountable. It's a splendid career, sir, that I have opened to you; but if I'd known that you had no ambition, I would have put you into my own counting house; though there, that wouldn't have done either, for I know you would have blotted the ledger, and turned all the accounts topsy-turvy.",enter military service company shoot hope rise command regiment rank civilian low list stupidity boy unaccountable splendid career sir open know have ambition put own counting house do know blote ledger turn account topsy turvy 
58,"""And now, sir, supper is ready;"" and the old gentleman led the way into the next room.",sir supper ready old gentleman lead way next room 
59,"Upon the following day Charlie was introduced, by his uncle, to the director who had given him his nomination, and was told by him that the board would sit upon the following day, and that he must call at the India House, at eleven o'clock. The ordeal was not a formidable one. He was shown into a room where eight or ten elderly gentlemen were sitting round a large table. Among these was his friend of the day before. He was asked a question or two about his age, his father's profession, and his place of education. Then the gentleman at the head of the table nodded to him, and said he could go, and instructions would be sent to him, and that he was to prepare to sail in the Lizzie Anderson, which would leave the docks in ten days' time, and that he would be, for the present, stationed at Madras.",follow day introduce uncle director give nomination tell board sit follow day call o'clock ordeal formidable one show room elderly gentleman sit large table friend day ask question age father profession place education gentleman head table nod say go instruction send prepare sail leave dock day time present station

He did not venture to penetrate into the latter's counting house, but awaited his coming upstairs to dinner, to tell him the news.",delight get ordeal return uncle venture penetrate latter counting house await come dinner tell news 
61,"""Humph!"" said his uncle; ""it is lucky they did not find out what a fool you were, at once. I was rather afraid that even the two minutes would do it. After dinner, I will send my clerk round with you, to get the few things which are necessary for your voyage.",say uncle lucky find fool afraid minute do dinner send clerk get few thing necessary voyage 
62,"""I suppose you will want to, what you call amuse yourself, to see the beasts at Exeter Change, and the playhouses. Here are two sovereigns. Don't get into loose company, and don't get drinking, sir, or out of the house you go.""",suppose want call amuse see beast playhouse sovereign get loose company get drinking sir house go 
63,"Charlie attempted to express his thanks, but his uncle stopped him abruptly.",attempt express thanks uncle stop 
64,"""Hold your tongue, sir. I am doing what is right; a thing, sir, Joshua Tufton always has done, and doesn't expect to be thanked for it. All I ask you is, that if you rob the Company's till and are hung, don't mention that you are related to me.""",hold tongue sir do right thing sir do expect thank ask rob company hung mention related 
65,"After dinner was over, Charlie went out under the charge of an old clerk, and visited tailors' and outfitters' shops, and found that his uncle's idea of the few necessaries for a voyage differed very widely from his own. The clerk, in each case, inquired from the tradesmen what was the outfit which gentlemen going to India generally took with them, and Charlie was absolutely appalled at the magnitude of the orders. Four dozen shirts, ten dozen pairs of stockings, two dozen suits of white cotton cloth, and everything else in proportion. Charlie in vain remonstrated, and even implored the clerk to abstain from ordering what appeared to him such a fabulous amount of things; and begged him, at any rate, to wait until he had spoken to his uncle. The clerk, however, replied that he had received instructions that the full usual outfit was to be obtained, and that Mr. Tufton never permitted his orders to be questioned. Charlie was forced to submit, but he was absolutely oppressed with the magnitude of his outfit, to carry which six huge trunks were required.",dinner go charge old clerk visit tailor outfitter shop find uncle idea few necessary voyage differ own clerk case inquire tradesmen outfit gentleman go take appalled magnitude order shirt pair stocking suit white cotton cloth else proportion vain remonstrate implore clerk abstain order appear fabulous amount thing begg rate wait speak uncle clerk reply receive instruction full usual outfit obtain permit order question force submit oppress magnitude outfit carry huge trunk require 
66,"""It is awful,"" Charlie said to himself, ""positively awful. How much it will all come to, goodness only knows; three or four hundred pounds, at least.""",awful say awful much come goodness know pound least 
67,"In those days, before steam was thought of, and the journey to India was often of six months' duration, men never came home more than once in seven years, and often remained in India from the day of their arrival until they finally retired, without once revisiting England. The outfits taken out were, therefore, necessarily much larger than at the present time, when a run home to England can be accomplished in three weeks, and there are plenty of shops, in every town in India, where all European articles of necessity or luxury can be purchased.",day steam think journey month duration man come more year remain day arrival retire revisit outfit take large present time run home accomplish week be plenty shop town european article necessity luxury purchase 
68,"After separating from the clerk, Charlie felt altogether unable to start out in search of amusement. He wandered about vaguely till supper time, and then attempted to address his uncle on the subject.",separate clerk feel unable start search amusement wander supper time attempt address uncle subject 
69,"""My dear Uncle,"" he began, ""you've been so awfully kind to me, that I really do not like to trespass upon you. I am positively frightened at the outfit your clerk has ordered. It is enormous. I'm sure I can't want so many things, possibly, and I would really rather take a much smaller outfit; and then, as I want them, I can have more things out from England, and pay for them myself.""",dear begin kind like trespass frighten outfit clerk order enormous sure want many thing take small outfit want have more thing pay 
70,"""You don't suppose,"" Mr. Tufton said sternly, ""that I'm going to have my nephew go out to India with the outfit of a cabin boy. I ordered that you were to have the proper outfit of a gentleman, and I requested my clerk to order a considerable portion of the things to be made of a size which will allow for your growing, for you look to me as if you were likely enough to run up into a lanky giant, of six feet high.
