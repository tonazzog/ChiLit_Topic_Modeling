2, THERE was a knock at the King’s study door. The King looked up from his plans for the new municipal washhouses and sighed; for that was the twenty-seventh knock that had come to his door since breakfast.,knock study door look plan new municipal washhouse sigh seventh knock come door breakfast 
3,"“Come in,” said the King, wearily.",come say 
4,"And the Lord Chief Good-doer came in. He wore a white gown and carried a white wand. If you had been there you would have noticed how clean the King’s study looked. All the books were bound in white vellum, and the floor was covered with white matting, and the window curtains were of white silk. Of course, it would not be right for every one to have such things, even if we were all kings because it would make such a lot of work for the servants. But this king, whose name was Alban, had an excellent housekeeper. She did all the cooking and cleaned everything by white magic, which is better even than _nettoyage-à-sec_ (if you know what that is), and only took the good lady five minutes every morning.",chief doer come wear white gown carry white wand notice clean study look book bind white vellum floor cover white matting window curtain white silk course right one have such thing king make lot work servant king name have excellent housekeeper do cooking clean white magic good sec_ know take good lady minute morning

8,"At the front door of the Palace was the King’s brother just getting off his elephant. He was a brown and yellow brother, withered and shrivelled like a very old apple, and dressed in a suite of plush of a bright orange, sown thick with emeralds. All the white marble terrace in front of the Palace was crowded with the retinue of the new arrival. Slaves of all colours—black, brown, yellow, and cream colour, dressed in all sorts of bright hues, scarlet and blue and purple and orange, with rubies and sapphires and amethysts and topazes sewn thickly on them, so that the eye could hardly bear the glow and glitter of them as they shone in the sunlight on the terrace.",front door brother get elephant brown yellow brother wither shrivell old apple dress suite plush bright orange sow thick emerald white marble terrace front crowd retinue new arrival slave colour black brown yellow cream colour dress sort bright hue scarlet blue purple orange ruby sapphire amethyst topaze sew eye bear glow glitter shine sunlight terrace 
9,"“Welcome, welcome!” King Alban cried, and kissed his brother on both cheeks, as is the fashion in Albanatolia and in many other civilised lands. Then, still holding him by both hands, he led him into the Palace. The jewelled gorgeous retinue followed him in, and the head parlour-maid shut the front door and put the chain up, because she knew it to be more than possible that a few odd rubies and sapphires and things would drop off the retinue on to the floor, and she thought any such little odds and ends might as well go into her dust-pan, when she swept up after lunch, as into the pockets of any poor people who might look in during the afternoon to ask the King’s advice, as they were fond of doing. This was the beginning of the trouble that was wrought by the coming of the King’s brother. Before this every door stood unfastened all day long, because every one was contented, and therefore honest.",cry kiss brother cheek fashion many other civilised land hold hand lead jewell gorgeous retinue follow head parlour maid shut front door put chain know more possible few odd ruby sapphire thing drop retinue floor think such little odd end go dust pan sweep lunch pocket poor person look afternoon ask advice fond do beginning trouble wring coming brother door stand unfasten day one contented honest 
10,"King Alban entertained his brother royally for seven days in the good old fashion, and then gave him a palace of his own to live in. The Palace was of white marble, like most of the buildings in Albanatolia, but the King’s brother had it painted red all over without a moment’s delay. And then he began to give parties and to have processions and to scatter money among the crowd, and every day the people loved him more. He was a loud, jolly, joking sort of man, with a black beard, and he always wore clothes of plush, a material hitherto unknown; and he always blazed with jewels, and he had a circus set up at his own expense in the field at the back of his Palace; and he introduced horse-racing and animated photographs—all highly coloured—and thus became extraordinarily popular: so much so that the people presently began to forget all the good that King Alban had done for them, and to wish secretly that the kingdom had happened to have a bright, cheerful king like Prince Negretti.",entertain brother day good old fashion give palace own live white marble most building brother have paint red moment delay begin give party have procession scatter money crowd day person love more loud jolly joke sort man black beard wear clothes plush material unknown blaze jewel have circus set own expense field back introduce horse racing animate photograph coloured become popular much person begin forget good do wish kingdom happen have bright cheerful king 
11,"For King Alban had worked so hard for his people’s good that he had not had time to be amusing. He had never had processions and circuses, preferring rather small tea-parties with the Lord Chief Good-doer, the Commissioner of Public Health, and a few chosen spirits from the Education Department, and loving best of all to wander alone, dreaming, among the blossoming orchards or in the meadows beyond the river, where the white jonquils grew, or in the lanes between the pearly may-bushes, or in the terraced garden of his Palace, where the white roses hung in heavy-scented clusters, and the white peacocks spread their tails upon the marble balustrades. And wherever he went he thought of the people’s good, and devised new ways of making them comfortable. Everything was beautifully managed. Every one had enough to wear and enough to eat, and enough to do, which is very important; but they had not enough to play at, and this was what made them ready to lend long and discontented ears to the whispers of the King’s brother.",work person good have time amusing have procession circuse prefer small tea- party chief public few choose spirit love good wander dreaming blossoming orchard meadow river white jonquil grow lane pearly bush terrace garden white rose hang heavy scent cluster white peacock spread tail marble balustrade go think person good devise new way make comfortable manage one have enough wear eat do important have enough play make ready lend long discontented ear whisper brother

13,"Now Negretti was a Magician, and his was the black or coloured magic which won’t wash clothes. He was always messing about with acids and alkalis, and sulphites and bicarbonates, and retorts and furnaces, and test-tubes, and pestles and mortars, and the like; and whenever he happened to make a nice colour by mixing two or more of these things together, he always put it in a bottle and stuck it up in one of the Palace windows, so that at night his windows were brighter than any chemist’s and druggist’s in any street, and the people said it was as good as fireworks. The King’s palace windows only sent out a soft white light like moonlight, and this was now considered very tame.",magician black coloured magic wash clothes mess acid alkalis sulphite bicarbonate retort furnace test tube pestle mortar like happen make nice colour mix more thing put bottle stick window night window bright chemist druggist street person say good firework palace window send soft white light moonlight consider tame 
14,"It was the Magician’s habit to wander about the town stirring up discontent as easily as if it had been one of his chemical messes; and though he was so well known among the people he was never recognised, because he always took care to disguise himself as a respectable person, and the disguise was quite impenetrable. (I hope you know what that is?)",habit wander town stir discontent chemical messe know person recognise take care disguise respectable person disguise impenetrable hope know 
15,"One night he sat disguised at the King’s Head—the finest of the municipal alehouses—drinking dog’s-nose out of a pewter-pot, and the grumbling of the people was music in his wicked ears.",night disguise fine municipal alehouse drinking dog nose pewter pot grumbling person music wicked ear

But, no; it’s white, white, white, till I’m sick of it. And us all wearing white by law, and washing done free, by white magic, at the Palace, on Mondays from 10 to 4.

23,"Then Negretti threw off his disguise—the pewter with the municipal arms on it rolled on the sanded floor, and spilt what was left of the dog’s-nose on to the disguise—and the Magician stood before them, pale but firm, his dark lantern in his hand. It was a magic lantern, of course.",throw disguise pewter municipal arm roll sand floor spilt leave dog nose disguise stand pale firm dark lantern hand magic lantern course 
24,"“Down-trodden slaves!” he cried, “poor benighted, oppressed people! Follow me!

26,"Now while the Magician was drinking his dog’s-nose, disguised as a respectable person, the King in his white robes was walking under the boughs of the white-blossomed pear-trees, for it was spring, and the moon was at the full. And presently, coming along over the dewy grey grass of the orchard, he saw a figure in white, and when it came close to him he saw that it was a lady more fair than the fair stars of that fair night.",drink dog nose disguise respectable person white robe walk bough white blossom pear tree spring moon full come dewy grey grass orchard see figure white come see lady fair fair star fair night

30,"“You will rest under my roof to-night,” said the King, and led her through the long sweet grass under the blossoming boughs to the Palace garden. When they came to the terrace the Princess loosed a lantern from her girdle, set it on the stone balustrade close by where one of the white peacocks perched in fluffy feathery slumber, kindled it, and threw open the horn door. A flood of light streamed out, bright as spring sunshine, and fell full upon her, and then the King saw that her gown was not white, as it had seemed in the moonlight, but was the colour of yellow gold, and her hair was red gold, and her eyes were of gold and grey mingled. Then for the first time in all his life the King thought of himself and of his own happiness, and he caught her hands and said—",rest roof night say lead long sweet grass blossoming bough garden come terrace loose lantern girdle set stone balustrade white peacock perch fluffy feathery slumber kindle throw open horn door flood light stream bright spring sunshine fall full see gown white seem moonlight colour yellow gold hair red gold eye gold grey mingle first time life think own happiness catch hand say

35,"“Always, my Queen,” said he, “exactly the same as you will love me. We are not of the race that changes heart.”",say same love race change heart 
36,"So then they kissed each other as lovers should, and wandered along the yew-tree avenue deep in lovers’ talk, and never even heard the crowd that the Magician had brought to the front door. So when the crowd found that the Palace door was locked for the night it went home again, but it came back in the morning with trumpets and banners and scraps of coloured stuff tied over its white clothing, and the King went out to meet it.",kiss other lover wander yew tree avenue deep lover talk hear crowd magician bring front door crowd find door lock night go come morning trumpet banner scrap coloured stuff tie white clothing go meet 
37,When the crowd saw him every one began to shout: “Down with Alban!” “Down with the White King!” “Free Beer!” “No more washing!” and things like that.,crowd see one begin shout white free beer more washing thing 
38,Then the King stood forth and said—,stand say 
39,"“What have I done but seek for your good? When, till now, have I thought of my own happiness? Who has stirred you up to these ill thoughts of me? My people, my own beloved people, have my ears ever been closed to your complaints? Have you wrongs? Tell me, and I will right them. Have you sorrows? Make them known and let me soothe them.

42,"“I did not know,” said the King, gently. “But now you have spoken I will at once appoint a Minister of Public Enjoyment, and——”",know say speak appoint public 
43,"The Magician was watching the crowd, and he saw how the sight of the King’s good face and the sound of his good voice were working on their hearts that had once loved him. Now Negretti sprang forward. “One word, brother!” he cried, and led the King into the shadow of a close-clipped yew-tree walk. The moment they were hidden he caught his brother’s arm and whispered a wicked spell: and the first words of it were in Persian, and the next in Greek, and after that came words in Arabic and Spanish, and the speech of the county of Essex, and the last words of all were “be changed to a stone.”",watch crowd see sight good face sound good voice work heart love spring word brother cry lead shadow close clippe yew tree walk moment hide catch brother arm whisper wicked spell first word next come word speech county last word change stone 
44,"And so strong was the spell that the King was turned to a stone that very minute—a great white stone—and fell under the yew hedge, and lay there.",strong spell turn stone minute great white stone fall yew hedge lay 
45,"Then the Magician said “Ha, ha!” and, after waiting so long as he deemed prudent, he went back to the people, and said—",say wait deem prudent go person say 
46,"“I regret to inform you that your King has proved quite unreliable as a man of business. When I urged him to sign a written agreement to keep you always in a good humour he refused, and then he remembered an urgent appointment in Nova Scotia; and he has gone, and taken most of the crown treasure with him. But, do not despair, I will be your King, and I have an income quite sufficient to keep up a small establishment of my own. And my golden argosies are now on the way from the Indies, bearing all manner of precious things, and bales of plush are on their way from Yorkshire. So now I am King.”",regret inform prove unreliable man business urge sign write agreement keep good humour refuse remember urgent appointment go take most crown treasure despair have income sufficient keep small establishment own golden argosies way bear manner precious thing bale plush way 
47,"The people believed him, for they had never known a King who spoke anything but the truth. So they shouted, “Long live the King!” and the matter was settled. That very day Negretti had the Palace painted magenta, and covered all the window-sashes and mantelpieces with gold paint, and stuck embossed coloured scraps on them.",person believe know speak truth shout live matter settle day have paint magenta cover window sashe mantelpiece gold paint stuck emboss coloured scrap 
48,"Then he went out into the garden to get a good look at his magenta Palace from the outside, and as he went along the clipped-yew walk there was the Princess Perihelia weeping over the white stone.",go garden get good look outside go clippe yew walk weep white stone

53,"The very next day Negretti put on the purple plush suit as well as the Royal Crown, and went to the wing of the Palace which the White King had set apart for the Princess Perihelia to live in. Alban’s crown was made of silver and pearls and moonstones, and the new King had ordered a new crown, all gold, and stuck as full of rubies and emeralds and sapphires as a really good Christmas cake is of plums. (I do not mean the cake they call “good, wholesome school cake,” but the kind they have at home when there is a party.) He took all his many-coloured retinue with him, and they waited on the terrace while the Magician knocked at the door.",next day put purple plush suit royal go wing white set live crown make silver pearl moonstone new order new crown gold stuck full ruby emerald sapphire good cake plum mean cake call good wholesome school cake kind have home be party take many coloured retinue wait terrace knock door 
54,"“Come in,” said the Princess.",come say 
55,"“I’ve come to marry you,” said the Magician, coming to the point at once; for he had arranged to have a procession that afternoon, and he was a little pressed for time.",come marry say come point arrange have procession afternoon little press time 
56,"But Perihelia said, “No, thank you.”",say thank 
57,"The Magician could hardly believe his ears. “But you’ll be Queen of the land,” said he, “and that’s what you’d have been if you’d married my brother, and, I suppose, what you wanted to be.”",magician believe ear land say marry brother suppose want

61,"“It’s the same thing,” he said.",same thing say 
62,"But she said: “No, it isn’t, not a bit.” And it was in vain that he showed her his best plush suit and the plush suits of his retainers; she simply wouldn’t look at them, nor at the precious stones either; so at last he went off to his Palace to make more rubies and precious stones and things like that, and she went off to cry over the white stone.",say bit vain show good plush suit plush suit retainer look precious stone last go make more ruby precious stone thing go cry white stone 
63,"Now a lot of tell-tale-tits had built their nests above the Palace, and some of them flew off and told the Magician how Perihelia was always crying in the yew avenue over the white stone. So he said to his slaves: “Get a hand-cart, and carry the thing on to the middle of the bridge and drop it into the river.” So they did, and the stone stuck, end-up, in the mud; and when the golden argosies of the Magician came up the river, bearing peacocks and apes and turquoises, every single galley split on that stone, and the whole treasure went to the bottom; all but the peacocks, and they flew away into the country of a neighbouring King, who thought every one should be useful and not ornamental; so he cut off the peacocks tails, and clipped their wings, and tried to teach them to lay turkey’s eggs. But it is very difficult to get a peacock to do anything useful.",lot tell tale tit build nest fly tell cry yew avenue white stone say slave get hand cart carry thing middle bridge drop river stone stuck end mud golden argosies come river bear peacock ape turquoise single galley split stone whole treasure go bottom peacock fly country neighbour think one useful ornamental cut peacock tail clippe wing try teach lay turkey egg difficult get peacock do useful 
64,"So then the Magician set a lot of people dredging for the lost treasure; and, among other things, they fished up some poor dead apes and the big white stone, and as the stone seemed to have been rather in the way in the bed of the river, they carted it away to the fields behind the town, where the white jonquils grew, and dumped it down there, and left it among the long grass.",set lot person dredg lose treasure other thing fish poor dead ape big white stone stone seem way bed river cart field town white jonquil grow dump leave long grass 
65,"And the Princess could not come and cry over it there because she did not know where it was, and besides she was very busy; for, after she had refused to marry him, the Magician said, “Very well, then, you can just do the free washing;” for the royal housekeeper had given five minutes’ notice, and left at the end of it, as soon as the new King had the Palace painted magenta, and no one else knew how to do washing by white magic, and though the people had sneered at it in the White King’s time they stood out for it now, and said free washing was what they had always been accustomed to. Poor Perihelia did not know the white magic; but she washed by the Sunlight Magic, and everything she sent home from the wash was pinky or pearly or greeny, like the little clouds in a May dawn. The people were pleased, but not the Magician.",come cry know busy refuse marry say do free washing royal housekeeper give minute notice leave end new have paint magenta else know do washing white magic person sneer white time stand say free washing accustom poor know white magic wash send wash pinky pearly greeny little cloud dawn person pleased 
66,"“I like a colour to _be_ a colour,” he said. “I hate your half measures.”",like colour colour say hate half measure 
67,"He was beginning to remodel the kingdom to his own fancy. Instead of a Lord Chief Good-doer he had a Lord Chief Magician, and instead of the Education Department he had a Permanent Committee of Black and Coloured Magic, and he shut up the free washhouses. “Who wants to wash?” said he, and he ordered a free distribution of nasty medicine instead; and altogether he was really beginning to enjoy himself when another tell-tale-tit came fluttering in at the window of his laboratory, and, perching on the top of a crucible, told him of a Rumour. The Rumour had been running about the town like a mad thing, and wherever it ran it left its tail behind it. Rumour, as you know, is a beast with many tales; and now everybody knew that the white stone had moved in the night and had come rolling up to the gate of the town.",begin remodel kingdom own fancy chief doer have chief have permanent black coloured shut free washhouse want wash say order free distribution nasty medicine begin enjoy tell tale tit come flutter window laboratory perch top crucible tell run town mad thing run leave tail rumour know beast many tale know white stone move night come roll gate town

70,"So the Lord Chief Magician called together the Permanent Committee of Black and Coloured Magic and sent them to break the stone. And when they began to hit it with their hammers and picks seventeen sharp splinters of white stone flew off, and each splinter hit a member of the Committee in the eye and killed him. There were exactly seventeen members, as it happened. So then the Lord Chief Magician shut the town gates and ran home and hid under the bed.",chief call permanent black coloured send break stone begin hit hammer pick sharp splinter white stone fly splinter hit member eye kill be member happen chief shut town gate run hide bed

74,"That night the stone rose up in the thickest of the black dark, when no one at all is out of doors, except the Police—and not always him—and it smashed through the town gate and came rolling right up into the Square and lay there.",night stone rise thickest black dark door police smash town gate come roll lay

78,"So he gave orders, and the stone was carted to the Palace, and built into the wall over the great gate; and while they were gone to fetch the red paint to cover up the stone and the mortar the Lord Chief Magician came out from under his bed, and went sneaking up to the Palace and in at the gate, and the stone fell on him and smashed him quite flat.",give order stone cart build wall great gate gone fetch red paint cover stone mortar chief come bed go sneak gate stone fall smash flat 
79,"Then Perihelia came running out, and she washed the mortar off the white stone by her Sunlight Magic; and when the Magician come out she said: “Let it lie here to-night, and to-morrow, if you will let me go, I will take it away to my own kingdom, so that it shall never trouble you again.”",come run wash mortar white stone come say let lie night let go take own kingdom trouble 
80,"Negretti agreed, because he did not know what else to do, and he was beginning to despair of the Princess ever marrying him, because he had now asked her to do so every day for a month, and always with more display of plush and jewels, and she said “No” more decidedly, and even crossly, every time. So he began to lose heart.",agree know else do begin despair marry ask do day month more display plush jewel say time begin lose heart 
81,"That night, just when the moon was waning, and before morning broke, Princess Perihelia slipped down the Palace stairs and into the garden to look once more on the place where the White King had promised to love her always.",night moon wane morning break slip stair garden look place white promise love 
82,"And when she came to that same place there was the white stone lying under the shadow of the white rose bushes, and pearly rose leaves had fallen all over it, and were falling still, like tears.",come same place be white stone lie shadow white rose bush pearly rose leave fall fall tear 
83,"Perihelia knelt down beside the stone and put her arms round it, and said—",knolt stone put arm say 
84,"“Poor stone, dear stone, what is it that troubles you so that you cannot rest? If I only knew, I might help you with my Sunlight Magic. Why are you so troubled, and why do I pity you so? Oh, if my White King were here he would understand and help you! But I can do nothing!”",poor stone dear stone trouble rest know help troubled pity white understand help do 
85,"With that she began to weep over the stone, calling on the White King to come back to her. And all the while she was talking and weeping the moon was waning and the light in the East grew pearlier and prettier minute by minute. And as she wept and clasped the stone she presently saw in the glowing light that the stone was changing in her arms. Like white sands falling in an hour-glass, the white stone fell away and fell away until the sun looked through the white rose bushes and saw Perihelia clasp the living form of the White King in her loving arms.",begin weep stone call white come talk weep moon wane light grow pearly pretty minute minute goot clasp stone see glow light stone change arm white sand fall hour glass white stone fall fall sun look white rose bush see clasp living form white loving arm 
86,"The sun’s was not the only eye which saw that meeting. The Magician had had a bad night, and he came out early, curious to see whether the stone had moved again. His curiosity was gratified.",sun only eye see meeting have bad night come curious see stone move curiosity gratified 
87,"When the White King saw his treacherous brother his tongue was loosed—hitherto kisses had been speech enough for him—and he spoke the words which he found in his mouth. And they were, naturally enough, the last words that had gone in at his ears, and the words were first Persian and then Greek, and then Arabic and Spanish, and the language of foreigners from Essex; and the words he wound up with were, “be changed into a stone.”",white see treacherous brother tongue loose hitherto kisse speech speak word find mouth last word go ear word first persian arabic language foreigner word wind change stone 
88,"But the wicked spell that had turned King Alban into a stone had grown weaker by keeping (as even ’20 port did when it was kept too long), and it had no longer power to do what it ought to have done. It could not turn the wicked Magician into a stone, as I am sure you would wish it to have done; it was only strong enough to turn him into a wooden post.",wicked spell turn stone grow weak keep port keep long have long power do do turn wicked magician stone sure wish do strong turn wooden post

90,"I do not wish to have to mention such an unpleasant character as Negretti again, so I will tell you at once the end of him. He remained a post for ever and ever, and later on, when King Alban had begun to do things for his people’s good again, he thought it a pity to waste even a post, for he was ever a careful King. So he had it made into a pump, and the water from it was bitter and nasty, like the medicine the Magician used to give the people; and it was very good for children, and gave them a nice bright colour in their cheeks. Take care you do not grow pale, or you may have to drink the water out of that pump. It is now at Harrogate, or Epsom, or Bath, or somewhere, and you might quite easily be taken there and made to drink that unpleasant water. The first persons who had to drink it were the Magician’s retinue. The King thought it would be good for them, and they were very grateful; but the next night they stole the State barge, and went home by sea to their own country.",wish have mention unpleasant character tell end remain post begin do thing person good think pity waste post careful have make pump water bitter nasty medicine use give person good child give nice bright colour cheek take care grow pale have drink water pump take make drink unpleasant water first person have drink retinue think good grateful next night steal barge go sea own country 
91,"Among his other improvements, the King started municipal omnibuses, which were white and gold. But the pump being near the place where the omnibuses changed horses the conductors used to take the bitter water to wash the omnibuses with, and gradually they became scarlet and blue and green and violet, just as you see them to-day. So now you know the reason of the colour of omnibuses. And this is the end of the Magician’s part of the story.",other improvement start municipal omnibuse white gold pump place omnibuse change horse conductor use take bitter water wash omnibuse become scarlet blue green violet see day know reason colour omnibuse end part story

93,"When the Magician had been turned into a post, the King said—",turn post say 
94,“I’m very sorry;” but the Princess said—,sorry say

97,"“Well,” said Perihelia, “I am Princess of the Sun, and if I marry you, my own dear King, I shan’t be able to help colouring your pretty white kingdom a little. Just soft sweet colours, dear, and not an inch of plush. We’ll make a law against _that_ the very first thing. And you shall go on teaching your people to be good, and I’ll try to teach them to be happy. Do you think I can?”",say marry own dear able help colour pretty white kingdom little soft sweet colour dear inch plush make law very first thing go teach person good try teach happy think 
98,"The White King smiled. “You’ve taught _me_,” he said; “but now, before we do anything for the people, let’s go and get married, and we can begin to make the new laws directly we’ve finished breakfast. We shall just have time to be married if we go off to church at once.”",white smile teach say do person let go married begin make new law finish breakfast have time married go church

100,"The first law was “There is to be no Plush at all in this kingdom.” And now Albanatolia is the most beautiful country in the world, all soft sweet colours and clear pearly white; and the Queen Perihelia has taught the people how to be happy, so the King has very little work to do, for they are good almost without his interfering at all. It is a lovely country. I hope you will go there some day. I went there once but they would not let me stay because I had a black coat on, and gaiters; and the sight of these clothes made the people so unhappy that the Queen asked me as a private and personal favour to go away, and never to come back unless I could come dressed in something like the colours of the clouds at dawn. I have never been able to manage this, and, anyway, I don’t suppose I could find the way there now. But, if you could get the proper dress, perhaps you could?",first law be plush kingdom beautiful country world soft sweet colour clear pearly white teach person happy have little work do good interfere lovely country hope go day go let stay have black coat gaiter sight clothes make person unhappy ask private personal favour go come come dress colour cloud dawn able manage suppose find way get proper dress
