1,CHAPTER 24. The Cruise of the Coracle,
2,"IT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west end of Treasure Island. The sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs.",broad day awoke find toss south west end sun hide great bulk glass side descend sea formidable cliff 
3,"Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock. I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.",elbow hill bare dark head bind cliff foot high fring great mass fall rock scarce quarter mile seaward first thought paddle land 
4,"That notion was soon given over. Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself, if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.",notion give fall rock breaker spout bellow loud reverberation heavy spray fly fall succeed second second see venture dash death rough shore spend strength vain scale beetling crag 
5,"Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their barkings.",crawl flat table rock let drop sea loud report beheld huge slimy monster soft snail incredible bigness score make rock echo barking 
6,"I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless. But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that landing-place. I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils.",understand sea lion harmless look add difficulty shore high running surf more disgust landing place feel willing starve sea confront such peril 
7,"In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me. North of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand. To the north of that, again, there comes another cape--Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.",meantime have good chance suppose land run long way leave low tide long stretch yellow sand north come cape mark chart bury tall green pine descend margin sea 
8,"I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods.",remember say current set whole west coast see position influence prefer leave reserve strength attempt land kindly look 
9,"There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. The wind blowing steady and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.",be great smooth swell sea wind blow steady gentle south be contrariety current billow rise fall unbroken 
10,"Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was, it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride. Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me; yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.",perish surprising little light boat ride lay bottom keep more eye gunwale see big blue summit heave close coracle bounce little dance spring subside other side trough bird 
11,"I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling. But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next wave.",begin little grow bold sit try skill paddling small change disposition weight produce violent change behaviour coracle move boat give gentle dancing movement run slope water steep make giddy strike nose spout spray deep side next wave 
12,"I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching land?",drench terrify fall old position coracle seem find head lead billow plain interfer rate way influence course hope leave reach land 
13,"I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.",begin frighten keep head move care bale coracle sea cap get eye more gunwale set study manage slip roller 
14,"I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the wave.",find wave big smooth glossy mountain look shore vessel deck world range hill dry land full peak smooth place valley coracle leave turn side side thread speak way low part avoid steep slope high topple summit wave 
15,"""Well, now,"" thought I to myself, ""it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land."" No sooner thought upon than done. There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.",think plain lie disturb balance plain put paddle side time time smooth place give shove land think do lay elbow try attitude give weak stroke turn head shore 
16,"It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail.",tiring slow work gain ground draw see miss point make yard easting see cool green tree top sway breeze feel sure make next promontory fail 
17,"It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.",high time begin torture thirst glow sun thousandfold reflection wave sea water fall dry cake very lip salt combine make throat burn brain ache sight tree hand make sick longing current carry point next reach sea open beheld sight change nature thought 
18,"Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder.",front mile beheld sail make sure course take distressed want water know glad sorry thought come conclusion surprise take entire possession mind do stare wonder 
19,"The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering.",main sail jib beautiful white canvas shine sun snow silver sight sail draw lie course north presume man board go island way anchorage begin fetch more more westward think sight go chase last fall wind eye take dead stand helpless sail shiver 
20,"""Clumsy fellows,"" said I; ""they must still be drunk as owls."" And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping.",clumsy fellow say drunk owl think set skip 
21,"Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain.",schooner fall fill tack sail minute bring dead wind eye repeat for north south east sail swoop dashe repetition end begin flap canvas become plain steering man dead drunk desert think get board return vessel captain 
22,"The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate. As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage.",current bear coracle schooner equal rate latter sailing wild intermittent hang time iron gain lose dare sit paddle make sure overhaul scheme have air adventure inspire thought water breaker fore companion double grow courage 
23,"Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face.",get welcome cloud spray time stick purpose set strength caution paddle unsteered ship sea heavy have stop bail heart flutter bird get way thing guide coracle wave blow bow dash foam face 
24,"I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her decks. I could not choose but suppose she was deserted. If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do what I chose with the ship.",gain schooner see brass glist tiller bang soul appear deck choose suppose desert man lie drunk bat do choose ship 
25,"For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me--standing still. She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all the time. Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again. I have said this was the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her leeway, which was naturally great.",time do bad thing possible stand head due south yaw course time time fall sail fill bring moment wind say bad thing possible helpless look situation canvas cracking block trundle bang deck continue run speed current whole amount leeway great 
26,"But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was stock-still but for the current.",last have chance breeze fall second low current turn revolve centre last present stern cabin window gape open lamp table burn day main sail hang droop banner stock current 
27,"For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase.",last little lose redoubl effort begin more overhaul chase 
28,"I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow.",yard wind come clap fill port tack stoop skimm swallow 
29,"My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle.",first impulse despair second joy round come broadside cover half third quarter distance separate see wave boil white forefoot tall look low station coracle 
30,"And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.",sudden begin comprehend have scarce time think scarce time act save summit swell schooner come stoop next bowsprit head spring foot leap stamp coracle water hand catch jib boom foot lodg stay brace cling pant dull blow tell schooner charge strike coracle leave retreat
