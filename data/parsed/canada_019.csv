2," The next morning, a little after daybreak, Martin and John made their appearance, leading the magnificent dog which Captain Sinclair had given to John. Like most large dogs, Oscar appeared to be very good-tempered, and treated the snarling and angry looks of the other dogs with perfect contempt.",next morning little daybreak make appearance lead magnificent dog give most large dog appear good temper treat snarling angry look other dog perfect contempt

4,"""It's a fine creature,"" observed Malachi, ""a wolf would stand no chance against him, and even a bear would have more on its hands than it could well manage I expect; but, come here, boy,"" said the old hunter to John, leading the dog outside of the door.",fine creature observe wolf stand chance bear have more hand manage expect come say old hunter lead dog door

6,"John made no reply, and the hunter continued--",make reply hunter continue 
7,"""I say it will be of use here, for the girls might meet with another wolf, or the house might be attacked; but good hunters don't want dogs. Is it to watch for us, and give us notice of danger? Why that's our duty, and we must trust to ourselves, and not to an animal. Is it to hunt for us? Why no dog can take a deer so well as we can with our rifles; a dog may discover us when we wish to be hidden; a dog's track will mark us out when we would wish our track to be doubted. The animal will be of no utility ever to us, John, and may do us harm, 'specially now the snow's on the ground. In the summer-time, you can take him and teach him how to behave as a hunter's dog should behave; but we had better leave him now, and start at once.""",say use girl meet wolf house attack good hunter want dog watch give notice danger duty trust animal hunt dog take deer rifle dog discover wish hide dog track mark wish track doubt animal utility do harm snow ground summer time take teach behave hunter dog behave leave start

10,"""Won't take the dog! well, that's very kind of you, John,"" said Mary, ""for we were longing to have him to protect us.""",take dog kind say long have protect 
11,"John shouldered his rifle, made a sign to Strawberry Plant, who rose, and looking kindly at Mrs. Campbell and the girls, without speaking, followed John out of the hut. Malachi certainly was not very polite, for he walked off, in company with John and the squaw, without taking the trouble to say ""Good-by."" It must, however, be observed that he was in conversation with Martin, who accompanied them on the way.",shoulder rifle make sign rise look girl speak follow hut polite walk company squaw take trouble say good observe conversation accompany way 
12,"The winter had now become very severe. The thermometer was twenty degrees below the freezing point, and the cold was so intense, that every precaution was taken against it. More than once Percival, whose business it was to bring in the firewood, was frost bitten, but as Mrs. Campbell was very watchful, the remedy of cold snow was always successfully applied. The howling of the wolves continued every night, but they were now used to it, and the only effect was, when one came more than usually close to the house, to make Oscar raise his head, growl, listen awhile, and then lie down to sleep again. Oscar became very fond of the girls, and was their invariable companion whenever they left the house. Alfred, Martin and Henry went out almost daily on hunting excursions; indeed, as there were no crops in the barn, they had little else to do. Mr. Campbell remained at home with his wife and nieces; occasionally, but not very often, Percival accompanied the hunters; of Malachi and John, they saw but little; John returned about every ten days, but although he adhered to his promise, his anxiety to go back to Malachi was so very apparent, and he was so restless, that Mrs. Campbell rather wished him to be away, than remain at home so much against his will.",winter become severe thermometer degree freezing point cold intense precaution take more business bring firewood bit watchful remedy cold snow apply howling wolf continue night use only effect come more close house make raise head grow listen lie sleep become fond girl invariable companion leave house go hunting excursion be crop barn have little else do remain home wife niece accompany hunter see little return day adhere promise anxiety go apparent restless wish remain home will 
13,"Thus passed away the time till the year closed in; confined as they were by the severity of the weather, and having little or nothing to do, the winter appeared longer and more tedious than it would have done had they been settled longer, and had the crops to occupy their attention; for it is in the winter that the Canadian farmer gets through all his thrashing and other work connected with the farm, preparatory for the coming spring. This being their first winter, they had, of course, no crops gathered in, and were, therefore, in want of employment. Mrs. Campbell and her nieces worked and read, and employed themselves in every way that they could, but constantly shut up within doors, they could not help feeling the monotony and _ennui_ of their situation. The young men found occupation and amusement in the chase; they brought a variety of animals and skins, and the evenings were generally devoted to a narration of what occurred in the day during their hunting excursions, but even these histories of the chase were at last heard with indifference. It was the same theme only with variations, over and over again, and there was no longer much excitement in listening.",pass time year close confine severity weather have little do winter appear long tedious do settle have crop occupy attention winter canadian farmer get thrashing other work connect farm preparatory come spring first winter course crop gather want employment niece work read employ way shut door help feel monotony _ennui_ situation young man find occupation amusement chase bring variety animal skin evening devote narration occur day hunting excursion history chase last hear indifference same theme variation be much excitement listen

18,"""Yes, well; that old Malachi will never bring us any more news about the Indians,"" continued Emma, yawning.",old bring more news continue yawn 
19,"""Why, I do not think that any news about them is likely to be pleasant news, Emma, and therefore, why should you wish it?""",think news likely pleasant news wish 
20,"""Why, my dear Mary, because I want _some_ news; I want something to excite me, I feel so dull. It's nothing but stitch, stitch, all day, and I am tired of always doing the same thing. What a horrid thing a Canadian winter Is, and not one-half over yet.""",dear want _some_ news want excite feel dull stitch stitch day tired do same thing horrid thing canadian winter half 
21,"""It is very dull and monotonous, my dear Emma, I admit, and if we had more variety of employment, we should find it more agreeable, but we ought to feel grateful that we have a good house over our heads, and more security than we anticipated.""",dull monotonous dear admit have more variety employment find agreeable feel grateful have good house head more security anticipate 
22,"""Almost too much security, Mary; I begin to feel that I could welcome an Indian even in his war-paint, just by way of a little change.""",much security begin feel welcome war paint way little change 
23,"""I think you would soon repent of your wish, if it were gratified.""",think repent wish gratified

25,"""Indeed, Emma, you are wrong to feel such discontent and weariness.""",wrong feel such discontent weariness 
26,"""Perhaps I am, but I have not walked a hundred yards for nearly one hundred days, and that will give one the blues, as they call them, and I do nothing but yawn, yawn, yawn, for want of air and exercise. Uncle won't let us move out on account of that horrid wolf. I wonder how Captain Sinclair is getting on at the fort, and whether he is as dull as we are.""",walk yard day give blue call do want air exercise uncle let move account horrid wolf wonder get fort dull 
27,"To do Emma justice, it was seldom that she indulged herself in such lamentations, but the tedium was more than her high flow of spirits could well bear. Mrs. Campbell made a point of arranging the household, which gave her occupation, and Mary from natural disposition did not feel the confinement as much as Emma did; whenever, therefore, she did show symptoms of restlessness or was tempted to utter a complaint, they reasoned with and soothed, but never reproached her.",do justice seldom indulge such lamentation tedium more high flow spirit bear make point arrange household give occupation natural disposition feel confinement much show symptom restlessness tempt utter complaint reason sooth reproach 
28,"The day after this conversation, Emma, to amuse herself, took a rifle and went out with Percival. She fired several shots at a mark, and by degrees acquired some dexterity; gradually she became fond of the exercise, and not a day passed that she and Percival did not practice for an hour or two, until at last Emma could fire with great precision. Practice and a knowledge of the perfect use of your weapon gives confidence, and this Emma did at last acquire. She challenged Alfred and Henry to fire at the bull's eye with her, and whether by their gallantry or her superior dexterity, she was declared victor. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell smiled when Emma came in and narrated her success, and felt glad that she had found something which afforded her amusement.",day conversation amuse take rifle go fire several shot mark degree acquire dexterity become fond exercise day pass practice hour last fire great precision practice knowledge perfect use weapon give confidence last acquire challenge fire bull eye gallantry superior dexterity declare victor smile come narrate success feel glad find afford amusement 
29,"It happened that one evening the hunters were very late; it was a clear moonlight night, but at eight o'clock they had not made their appearance; Percival had opened the door to go out for some firewood which had been piled within the palisades, and as it was later than the usual hour for locking the palisade gates, Mr. Campbell had directed him so to do. Emma, attracted by the beauty of the night, was at the door of the house, when the howl of a wolf was heard close to them; the dogs accustomed to it merely sprang on their feet, but did not leave the kitchen fire; Emma went out, and looked through the palisades to see if she could perceive the animal, and little Trim, the terrier, followed her. Now Trim was so small, that he could creep between the palisades, and as soon as he was close to them, perceiving the wolf, the courageous little animal squeezed through them and flew toward it, barking as loud as he could. Emma immediately ran in, took down her rifle and went out again, as she knew that poor Trim would soon be devoured. The supposition was correct: the wolf, instead of retreating, closed with the little dog and seized it. Emma, who could now plainly perceive the animal, which was about forty yards from her, took aim and fired, just as poor Trim gave a loud yelp. Her aim was good, and the wolf and dog lay side by side. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, and Mary, hearing the report of the rifle, ran out, and found Percival and Emma at the palisades behind the house.",happen evening hunter late clear moonlight night o'clock make appearance open door go firewood pile palisadd usual hour lock palisade gate direct do attract beauty night door house howl wolf hear close dog accustom spring foot leave kitchen fire go look palisadd see perceive animal little terrier follow small creep palisadd close perceive wolf courageous little animal squeeze fly bark run take rifle go know poor trim devoure supposition correct wolf retreat close little dog seize perceive animal yard take aim fire poor give loud yelp aim good wolf dog lay side side hear report rifle run find palisadd house

32,"""Here they come,"" said Percival, ""as fast as they can run.""",come say run 
33,The hunters were soon at the palisade door and admitted; they had no game with them. Emma jeered them for coming back empty handed.,hunter palisade door admit have game jeer come empty 
34,"""No, no, my little cousin,"" replied Alfred, ""we heard the report of a rifle, and we threw down our game, that we might sooner come to your assistance if you required it. What was the matter?""",little cousin reply hear report rifle throw game come assistance require matter 
35,"""Only that I have killed a wolf, and am not allowed to bring in my trophy,"" replied Emma. ""Come, Alfred, I may go with you and Martin.""",kill wolf allow bring trophy reply come go 
36,"They went to the spot, and found the wolf was dead, and poor Trim dead also by his side. They took in the body of the little dog, and left the wolf till the morning, when Martin said he would skin it for Miss Emma.",go spot find wolf dead poor trim dead side take body little dog leave wolf morning say skin 
37,"""And I'll make a footstool of it,"" said Emma; ""that shall be my revenge for the fright I had from the other wolf. Come, Oscar, good dog; you and I will go wolf-hunting. Dear me, who would have thought that I should have ever killed a wolf--poor little Trim!""",make footstool say revenge fright have other wolf come good dog go wolf hunting think kill wolf poor little trim 
38,"Martin said it would be useless to return for the venison, as the wolves had no doubt eaten it already; so they locked the palisade gate, and went into the house.",say useless return venison wolf have doubt eat lock palisade gate go house 
39,"Emma's adventure was the topic of the evening, and Emma herself was much pleased at having accomplished such a feat.",adventure topic evening pleased accomplish feat

42,[FACING A WOLF.],facing 
43,"""It was a wife of one of our farmers, ma'am; she was at the outhouse doing something, when she perceived a wolf enter the cottage-door, where there was nobody except the baby in the cradle. She ran back and found the wolf just lifting the infant out of the cradle by its clothes. The animal looked at her with his eyes flashing; but having its mouth full, it did not choose to drop the baby, and spring at her; all it wanted was to get clear off with its prey. The woman had presence of mind enough to take down her husband's rifle and point it to the wolf, but she was so fearful of hurting the child, that she did not put the muzzle to its head, but to its shoulder. She fired just as the wolf was making off, and the animal fell, and could not get on its feet again, and it then dropped the child out of its mouth to attack the mother. The woman caught the child up, but the wolf gave her a severe bite on the arm, and broke the bone near the wrist. A wolf has a wonderful strong jaw, ma'am. However, the baby was saved, and neighbors came and dispatched the animal.""",wife farmer outhouse do perceive wolf enter cottage door be baby cradle run find wolf lift infant cradle clothes animal look eye flash have mouth full choose drop baby spring want get clear prey woman have presence mind take husband rifle point wolf fearful hurt child put muzzle head shoulder fire wolf make animal fall get foot drop child mouth attack mother woman catch child wolf give severe bite arm break bone wrist wolf have wonderful strong jaw ma'am baby save neighbor come dispatch animal

49,"""I understand,"" replied Mrs. Campbell, ""he was born before the colonies obtained their independence.""",understand reply bear colony obtain independence 
50,"""Yes, ma'am, long before; there's no saying how old he is. When I was quite a child, I recollect he was then reckoned an old man; indeed, the name the Indians gave to him proves it. He then was called the 'Gray Badger.'""",be say old child recollect reckon old man name give prove call gray 
51,"""But is he so very old, do you really think, Martin?""",old think 
52,"""I think he has seen more than sixty snows, ma'am; but not many more; the fact is, his hair was gray before he was twenty years old; he told me so himself, and that's one reason why the Indians are so fearful of him. They have it from their fathers that the Gray Badger was a great hunter, as Malachi was more than forty years ago; so they imagine as his hair was gray then, he must have been a very old man at that time back, and so to them he appears to live forever, and they consider him as charmed, and to use their phrase, 'great _medicine_.' I've heard some Indians declare that Malachi had seen one hundred and fifty winters, and they really believe it. I never contradicted them, as you may imagine.""",think see more snow many more fact hair gray year old tell reason fearful have father great hunter more year imagine hair gray old man time appear live consider charm use phrase great _medicine_ hear declare see winter believe contradict imagine

His lodge is always full of meat, and he has plenty of skins. He don't drink spirits, and if he has tobacco for smoking and powder and ball, what else can he want?""",squaw know want bid fond old man look father lodge full meat have plenty skin drink spirit have tobacco smoking powder ball want
