5,"""And the poor king and queen wept copiously at the mere thought, and all the ladies and attendants of the Princess were ordered on no account to let a breath of the terrible story be heard by her. Yet, after all, it so happened that her suspicions were aroused afresh by the sight this time of the weeping Bruna. For nothing else could be suggested than again to try to deceive the monster; and Bruna, a still prettier girl than the gardener's daughter, was this time chosen to represent the Princess. But all happened as before. The brown bull rushed off with his prize, the whole day the unfortunate Bruna was shaken on his back, and again, as night began to fall, he stopped at the same spot.",poor king queen goot mere thought lady attendant order account let breath terrible story hear happen suspicion arouse sight time weeping else suggest try deceive monster pretty girl gardener daughter time choose represent happen brown bull rush prize whole day unfortunate shake back night begin fall stop same spot

9,"""'Throw thee once, throw thee twice, throw thee _thrice_,' roared the bull, each time shaking the henwife's daughter roughly, at the end flinging her to the ground. 'Shame on thee, thou henwife's daughter, to call thyself a true Princess.'",throw throw throw _thrice_ roar bull time shake henwife daughter end fling ground shame henwife daughter call true 
10,"""And with that off he rushed, furious, and from that day the ravages and the terrors began again, and Bruna found her way home, bruised and weeping, to tell her story.",rush furious day ravage terror begin find way bruise weep tell story 
11,"""This was the tale now related to the Princess, and as she listened a strange look of determination and courage came over her face.",tale related listen strange look determination courage come face 
12,"""'There is but one thing to be done,' she said. 'It is childish to attempt to deceive a creature who is evidently not what he seems. Let me go myself, my parents. Trust me to do my best. And, at worst, if I perish, it will be in a good cause. Better it should be so than that our people should be driven from their homes, the whole country devastated, and all its happiness destroyed.'",be thing do say childish attempt deceive creature seem let go parent trust do good bad perish good cause good person drive home whole country devastate happiness destroy 
13,"""The king and queen had no answer to give but their tears. But the Princess remained firm, and they found themselves obliged to do as she directed. A messenger was sent to the monster to inform him, for the third time, that his terms were to be agreed to, and the rest of the day was spent in the palace in weeping and lamentation.",king queen have answer give tear remain firm find oblige do direct messenger send monster inform third time term agree rest day spend palace weeping lamentation 
14,"""Only, strange to say, the Princess shed no tears. She seemed as cheerful as usual; she played with her golden balls, and endeavoured to comfort her sorrowful parents, and was so brave and hopeful that in spite of themselves the poor king and queen could not help feeling a little comforted.",strange say shed tear seem cheerful usual play golden ball endeavour comfort sorrowful parent brave hopeful spite poor king queen help feel little comfort

18,"""The next morning, at the usual time, the terrible visitor made his appearance. He came slowly up to the castle courtyard and stood at the great entrance, tossing his enormous head with impatience. But he was not kept waiting long; the doors were flung open, and at the top of the flight of steps leading down from them appeared the young Princess, pale but resolute, her fair hair floating over her shoulders, her golden balls flashing as she slowly walked down the steps, tossing them as she went. And, unlike the false princesses, she was dressed entirely in black, without a single jewel or ornament of any kind--nothing but her balls, and her hair caught the sunlight as she passed. There were no soldiers this time, no crowd of weeping friends; the grief of the king and queen was now too real to be shown, and the Princess had asked that there should be no one to see her go.",next morning usual time terrible visitor make appearance come castle courtyard stand great entrance toss enormous head impatience keep wait door flung open top flight step lead appear young pale resolute fair hair float shoulder golden ball flash walk step toss go false princess dress black single jewel ornament kind ball hair catch sunlight pass be soldier time crowd weep friend grief king queen real show ask be see go 
19,"""The brown bull stood still as a lamb for her to mount, and then at a gentle pace he set off. The Princess had no need to catch hold of his horns to keep herself from falling, his step was so even. And all along as she rode she threw her balls up softly in the air, catching them as they fell. But the brown bull spoke not a word.",brown bull stand lamb mount gentle pace set have need catch hold horn keep fall step ride throw ball air catching fall brown bull speak word 
20,"""On and on they went; the sun rose high in the heavens and poured down on the girl's uncovered head the full heat of his rays. But just as she began to feel it painfully, they entered a forest, where the green shade of the summer trees made a pleasant shelter. And when they came out from the forest again on the other side the sun was declining; before long he had sunk below the horizon, evening was at hand. And as before, the brown bull stopped.",go sun rise heaven pour girl uncover head full heat ray begin feel enter forest green shade summer tree make pleasant shelter come forest other side sun decline sink horizon evening hand brown bull stop 
21,"""'King's daughter,' he said, in a voice so gentle, though deep, that the Princess started with surprise, 'what hour must it be by this? Tell me, king's daughter, I pray.'",daughter say voice gentle deep start surprise hour tell king daughter pray 
22,"""'Brown bull,' replied the Princess, without a moment's hesitation, for those who have nothing to conceal are fearless and ready; 'brown bull, it is getting late. By now must the king and queen, my father and mother, be sitting down to their solitary supper and thinking of me, for at this hour I was used to hasten to them, throwing my pretty balls as I went.'",brown bull reply moment hesitation have conceal fearless ready brown bull get late king queen father mother sit solitary supper think hour use hast throw pretty ball go

25,"""And ere long the night fell, and the poor Princess was so tired and sleepy, that without knowing it her pretty head drooped lower and lower, and at last she lay fast asleep on the bull's broad back, her fair head resting between his horns.",night fall poor tired sleepy know pretty head droop low low last lay bull broad back fair head rest horn 
26,"""She slept so soundly that she did not notice when he stopped, only she had a strange dream. Some one lifted her gently and laid her on a couch, it seemed to her, and a kind voice whispered in her ear, 'Good-night, my fair Princess.'",sleep notice stop have strange dream one lift lay couch seem kind voice whisper ear good night fair 
27,"""But it must have been a dream, she said to herself. How could a bull have arms to lift her, or how could a rough, ferocious creature like him be so gentle and kind? It must have been a dream, for when she awoke she saw the great monster standing beside her on his four legs as usual; yet it was strange, for she found herself lying on a delicious mossy couch, and the softest and driest moss had been gathered together for a pillow, and beside her a cup of fresh milk and a cake of oaten bread were lying for her breakfast. How had all this been done for her? she asked herself, as she ate with a very good appetite, for she had had no food since the morning before. She began to think the bull not so bad after all, and to wonder if it was to Fairyland he was going to take her. And as she thought this to herself she threw her balls, which were lying beside her, up into the air, and the morning sun caught their sparkle and seemed to send it dancing back again on to her bright fair hair. And a sudden fancy seized her.",dream say bull have arm lift rough ferocious creature like gentle kind dream awoke see great monster stand leg usual strange find lie delicious mossy couch softest dry moss gather pillow cup fresh milk cake oaten bread lie breakfast do ask eat good appetite have food morning begin think bull bad wonder go take think throw ball lie air morning sun catch sparkle seem send dance bright fair hair sudden fancy seize

29,"""'Catch,' she said again, and he had caught the second.",catch say catch second 
30,"""'Catch,' a third time. The great creature caught it in his mouth like a dog, and brought it gently to the Princess and laid it at her feet. She took it and half timidly stroked his head; and no one who had seen the soft pathetic look which crept into his large round eyes would have believed in his being the cruel monster he had been described. He did not speak, he seemed without the power to do so now, but by signs he made the Princess understand it was time to continue their journey, and she mounted his back as before.",catch third time great creature catch mouth dog bring lay foot take half stroke head see soft pathetic look creep large round eye believe cruel monster describe speak seem power do sign make understand time continue journey mount back 
31,"""All that day the bull travelled on, but the Princess was now getting accustomed to her strange steed, and felt less tired and frightened. And when the sun grew hot the bull was sure to find a sheltered path, where the trees shaded her from the glare, and when the road was rough he went the more slowly, that she should not be shaken.",day bull travel get accustom strange steed feel tired frighten sun grow hot bull sure find shelter path tree shade glare road rough go shake 
32,"""Late in the evening the Princess heard a far-off rushing sound, that as they went seemed to grow louder and louder.",evening hear rush sound go seem grow louder louder 
33,"""'What is that, brown bull?' she asked, feeling somehow a little frightened.",brown bull ask feel little frighten 
34,"""The brown bull raised his head and looked round him. Yes, the sun had sunk, he might speak. And in the same deep voice he answered,",brown bull raise head look sun sink speak same deep voice answer

37,"""'Have no fear,' he replied. 'Lay down your head and shut your eyes, and no harm will come near you.'",have fear reply lay head shut eye harm come 
38,"""The Princess did as he bade her. She heard the roar of the waves come nearer and nearer, a cold wind blew over her face, and she felt at last that her huge steed had plunged into the water, for it splashed on to her hand, which was hanging downwards, and then she heard him, with a gasp and a snort, strike out boldly. The Princess drew herself up on the bull's back as closely as she could; she had no wish to get wet. But she was not frightened. She grew accustomed to the motion of her great steed's swimming, and as she kept her eyes fast shut she did not see how near she was to the water, and felt as if in a peaceful dream. And after a while the feeling became reality, for she fell fast asleep and dreamt she was in her little turret chamber, listening to the wind softly blowing through the casement.",bid hear roar wave come cold wind blow face feel last huge steed plunge water splash hand hang hear gasp snort strike draw bull back have wish get wet frighten grow accustom motion great steed swim keep eye shut see water feel peaceful dream while feeling become reality fall asleep dreamt little turret chamber listen wind blow casement 
39,"""When she awoke she was alone. She was lying on a couch, but this time not of moss, but of the richest and softest silk. She rubbed her eyes and looked about her. Was she in her father's castle? Had her youth and her courage softened the monster's heart, and made him carry her back again to her happy home? For a moment she thought it must be so; but no, when she looked again, none of the rooms in her old home were so beautiful as this one where she found herself. Not even her mother's great saloon, which she had always thought so magnificent, was to be compared with it. It was not very large, but it was more like Fairyland than anything she had ever dreamt of. The loveliest flowers were trained against the walls, here and there fountains of delicately scented waters refreshed the air, the floor was covered with carpets of the richest hues and the softest texture. There were birds singing among the flowers, gold and silver fish sporting in the marble basins--it was a perfect fairy's bower. The Princess sat up and looked about her. There was no one to be seen, not a sound but the dropping of the fountains and the soft chatter of the birds. The Princess admired it all exceedingly, but she was very hungry, and as her long sleep had completely refreshed her, she felt no longer inclined to lie still. So she crossed the room to where a curtain was hanging, which she thought perhaps concealed a door. She drew aside the curtain, the door behind was already open; she found herself in a second room, almost as beautiful as the first, and lighted in the same way with coloured lamps hanging from the roof. And to her great delight, before her was a table already laid for supper with every kind of delicious fruit and bread, and cakes, and everything that a young Princess could desire. She was so hungry that she at once sat down to the table, and then she perceived to her surprise that it was laid for two!",awoke alone lie couch time moss rich softest silk rub eye look father castle have youth courage soften monster heart make carry happy home moment think look room old home beautiful one find mother great saloon think magnificent compare large dreamt loveliest flower train wall fountain scent water refresh air floor cover carpet rich hue softest texture be bird sing flower gold silver fish sport marble basin perfect fairy bower sit look be see sound drop fountain soft chatter bird admire hungry long sleep refresh feel inclined lie cross room curtain hang think conceal door draw curtain door open find second room beautiful first light same way coloured lamp hang roof great delight table lay supper kind delicious fruit bread cake young desire hungry sit table perceive surprise lay 
40,"""'Can the bull be coming to sup with me?' she said to herself, half laughing at the idea. And she added aloud, 'Come if you like, Mr. Bull; I find your house very pretty, and I thank you for your hospitality.'",bull come sup say half laugh idea add come like find house pretty thank hospitality 
41,"""And as she said the words, a voice which somehow seemed familiar to her, replied,",say word voice seem familiar reply

Without it I could not have entered your presence as I do now,' and looking up, she saw, coming in by another door that she had not noticed, a most unexpected visitor.",thank gracious permission enter presence do look see come door notice unexpected visitor 
43,"""It was not the bull, it was a young Prince such as our pretty Princess, who was not without her daydreams, like other young girls, had sometimes pictured to herself as coming on a splendid horse, with his followers around him in gallant attire, to ask her of her parents. He was well made and manly, with a bright and pleasant expression, and dressed, of course, to perfection. The Princess glanced at her plain black robe in vexation, and her fair face flushed.",bull young such pretty daydream other young girl picture come splendid horse follower gallant attire ask parent make manly bright pleasant expression dress course perfection glance plain black robe vexation fair face flush 
44,"""'I knew not,' she began. 'I thought I should see no one but the brown bull.'",know begin think see brown bull 
45,"""The Prince laughed merrily. He was in good spirits naturally, as any one would be who, after being forced for ten years to wear a frightful and hideous disguise, and to behave like a rough and surly bull, instead of like a well-born gentleman, should suddenly find himself in his own pleasant person again.",laugh good spirit one force year wear frightful hideous disguise behave rough surly bull bear gentleman find own pleasant person 
46,"""'I _was_ the bull,' he said, 'but you, Princess, have transformed me. How can I ever show you my gratitude?'",_was_ bull say transform show gratitude 
47,"""'You owe me none,' said the Princess gently. 'What I did was to save my parents and their people. If it has served you in good stead, that for me is reward enough. But,' she added, 'I wish I had brought some of my pretty dresses with me. It must look so rude to you to have this ugly black one.'",owe say do save parent person serve good stead reward add wish bring pretty dress look rude have ugly black one 
48,"""The Prince begged her not to trouble herself about such a trifle--to him she was beautiful as the day in whatever attire she happened to be. And then they ate their supper with a good appetite, though it seemed strange to the Princess to be quite without attendants, sitting alone at table with a young man whom she had never seen before.",begg trouble trifle beautiful day attire happen eat supper good appetite seem strange attendant sit table young man see 
49,"""And after supper a new idea struck her.",supper new idea strike 
50,"""'Catch,' she said, drawing the first ball out of the little pocket in the front of her dress, where she always carried her balls, and flinging it across the table to the Prince with her usual skill, not breaking a glass or bending a leaf of the flowers with which the dishes were adorned.",catch say draw first ball little pocket front dress carry ball fling table usual skill break glass bending leaf flower dish adorn

55,"""'I must go,' he said; 'my hour of liberty is over.'",go say hour liberty 
56,"""'Go?' said the Princess in surprise and distress, for she had found the Prince a very pleasant companion. 'You must go? and leave me alone here?'",go say surprise distress find pleasant companion go leave

58,"""'Alas, Princess!' he said, 'in my joy for the moment, I had almost forgotten my sad fate;' and then he went on to explain to her that for many years past he had been under a fairy spell, the work of an evil fairy who had vowed to revenge herself on his parents for some fancied insult to her. He had been forced to take the form of a bull and to spread terror wherever he went; and the power of this spell was to continue till he should meet with a beautiful Princess who of her own free will would return with him to his country and treat him with friendliness, both of which conditions had been now fulfilled.",say joy moment forget sad fate go explain many year past fairy spell work evil fairy vow revenge parent fancy insult force take form bull spread terror go power spell continue meet beautiful own free will return country treat friendliness condition fulfil 
59,"""'Then all is right!' exclaimed the Princess joyfully. 'Why should you look so sad?'",right exclaim look sad 
60,"""'Alas! no,' repeated the Prince, 'the spell is but partly broken. I have only power to regain my natural form for three hours every evening after sunset. And for three years more must it be so. Then, if your goodness continues so long, all will indeed be right. But during that time it will be necessary for you to live alone, except for the three hours I can pass with you, in this enchanted palace of mine. No harm will befall you, all your wants will be supplied by invisible hands; but for a young and beautiful Princess like you, it will be a sad trial, and one that I feel I have no right to ask your consent to.'",repeat spell break have power regain natural form hour evening sunset year more goodness continue right time necessary live hour pass enchanted palace harm befall want supply invisible hand young beautiful princess sad trial feel have right ask consent 
61,"""'And can nothing be done?' said the Princess, 'nothing to shorten your endurance of the spell?'",do say shorten endurance spell

63,"""He glanced towards the corner of the room where, though the Princess had not before observed it, the brown bull's skin lay in a heap.",glance corner room observe brown bull skin lay heap

67,"""The Prince came nearer her and said in a low voice, 'For _me_ they would be such. In such a case I might too probably never see you more.'",come say low voice such case see more 
68,"""The Princess blushed. Considering that he had spent ten years as a bull, it seemed to her that the Prince's manners were really not to be found fault with, and she promised him that she would consider the matter over, and by the next evening tell him her decision.",blush consider spend year bull seem manners find fault promise consider matter next evening tell decision 
69,"""She felt rather inclined to cry when she found herself again quite alone in the great strange palace, for she was only sixteen, even though so brave and cheerful. But still she had nothing whatever to complain of. Not a wish was formed in her heart but it was at once fulfilled, for this power was still the Prince's. She found, in what was evidently intended for her dressing-room, everything a young Princess could possibly desire in the shape of dresses, each more lovely than the others; shoes of silk or satin, exquisitely embroidered to suit her various costumes; laces and shawls, ribbons and feathers, and jewels of every conceivable kind in far greater abundance than so sensible a young lady found at all necessary. But believing all these pretty things to be provided to please her by the Prince's desire, she endeavoured to amuse herself with them, and found it rather interesting for the first time in her life to have to choose for herself. Her breakfasts and dinners, and everything conceivable in the shape of delicate and delicious food, appeared whenever she wished for anything of the kind; invisible hands opened the windows and shut the doors, lighted the lamps when the evening closed in, arranged her long fair hair more skilfully than any mortal maid, and brushed it softly when at night she wished to have it unfastened. Books in every language to interest her, for the Princess had been well taught, appeared on the tables, also materials for painting and for embroidery, in which she was very clever. Altogether it was impossible to complain, and the next day passed pleasantly enough, though it must be confessed the young Princess often found herself counting the hours till it should be that of sunset.",feel inclined cry find alone great strange palace brave cheerful have complain wish form heart fulfil power find intend dress room young desire shape dress lovely other shoe silk satin embroider suit various costume lace shawl ribbon feather jewel conceivable kind great abundance sensible young lady find necessary believe pretty thing provide please desire endeavour amuse find interesting first time life have choose breakfast dinner conceivable shape delicate delicious food appear wish kind invisible hand open window shut door light lamp evening close arrange long fair hair mortal maid brush night wish have unfasten book language interest teach appear table material painting embroidery clever impossible complain next day pass confess young find count hour sunset 
70,"""Punctual to the moment the Prince made his appearance, but to his guest's distress he seemed careworn and anxious.",punctual moment make appearance guest distress seem careworn anxious 
71,"""'Has some new misfortune threatened you?' she asked.",new misfortune threaten ask 
72,"""'No,' replied the Prince, 'but I have to-day scarcely been able to endure my anxiety to learn your decision. Never in all these terrible years has my suffering been greater, never have I so loathed the hideous disguise in which I am compelled to live.'",reply have day able endure anxiety learn decision terrible year suffering great loath hideous disguise compel live 
73,"""Tears filled the Princess's eyes. Had anything been wanting to decide her, the deep pity which she now felt for the unfortunate Prince would have done so.",tear fill eye want decide deep pity feel unfortunate do 
74,"""'I _have_ decided!' she exclaimed. 'Three years will soon pass, and I shall be well able to amuse myself with all the charming things with which I am surrounded. Besides, I shall see you every day, and the looking forward to that will help to cheer me.'",decide exclaim year pass able amuse charming thing surround see day look help cheer 
75,"""It would be impossible to tell the Prince's delight. He became at once as gay and lively as the day before. The Princess and he had supper together, and amused themselves afterwards with the enchanted balls, and the evening passed so quickly that the princess could hardly believe more than one hour instead of three had gone, when he started up, saying his time was over. It was sad to see him go, forced, through no fault of his own, to return to his hated disguise; but still it was with a lightened heart that the poor brown bull went tramping about during the next one-and-twenty hours.",impossible tell delight become gay lively day have supper amuse enchanted ball evening pass princess believe more hour go start say time sad see go force fault own return hate disguise lighten heart poor brown bull go tramp next one hour 
76,"""And on her side the Princess's lonely hours were cheered by the thought that she was to be the means of freeing him from the power of the terrible spell, for all that she saw of him only served to increase her sympathy and respect.",side lonely hour cheer thought means free power terrible spell see serve increase sympathy respect 
77,"""So time went on. The Princess got more and more accustomed to her strange life, and every day more attached to the Prince, who on his side could not do enough to prove to her his gratitude. For many weeks he never failed to enter her presence the instant the sun had sunk below the horizon, and the three hours they spent together made amends to both for the loneliness of the rest of the day. And whenever the Princess felt inclined to murmur, she renewed her patience and courage by the thought of how much harder to bear was the Prince's share of the trial. She was allowed to remain in peaceful security, and to employ her time in pleasant and interesting ways; while he was forced to rove the world as a hateful monster, shunned by any of the human race whom he happened to meet, constantly exposed to fatigue and privation.",time go get more accustom strange life day attach side do prove gratitude many week fail enter presence instant sun sink horizon hour spend make amend loneliness rest day feel inclined murmur renew patience courage thought much hard bear share trial allow remain peaceful security employ time pleasant interesting way force reve world hateful monster shunn human race happen meet expose fatigue privation 
78,"""Sometimes they spent a part of the evening in the beautiful gardens surrounding the palace. There, one day, as sunset was approaching, the Princess had betaken herself to wait the Prince's arrival, when a sad shock met her. It was past the usual hour of his coming. Several times she had wandered up and down the path by which he generally approached the castle, tossing her balls as she went, for more than once he had seen their glitter from a distance, and known by it that she was waiting. But this evening she waited and watched in vain, and at last, a strange anxiety seizing her, she turned towards the castle to see if possibly he had entered from the other side, and was hurrying back when a low moan reached her ears, causing her heart for an instant almost to leave off beating with terror.",spend part evening beautiful garden surround palace day sunset approach betake wait arrival sad shock meet usual hour come several time wander path approach castle toss ball go more see glitter distance know wait evening wait watch vain last strange anxiety seize turn castle see enter other side hurry low moan reach ear cause heart instant leave beat terror
