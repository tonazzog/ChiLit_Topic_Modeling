1,CHAPTER VI. WATER! WATER!,water water 
2,"Two hours later, that is, about four o'clock, I woke up, for so soon as the first heavy demand of bodily fatigue had been satisfied, the torturing thirst from which I was suffering asserted itself. I could sleep no more. I had been dreaming that I was bathing in a running stream, with green banks and trees upon them, and I awoke to find myself in this arid wilderness, and to remember, as Umbopa had said, that if we did not find water this day we must perish miserably. No human creature could live long without water in that heat. I sat up and rubbed my grimy face with my dry and horny hands, as my lips and eyelids were stuck together, and it was only after some friction and with an effort that I was able to open them. It was not far from dawn, but there was none of the bright feel of dawn in the air, which was thick with a hot murkiness that I cannot describe. The others were still sleeping.",hour o'clock wake first heavy demand bodily fatigue satisfy torture thirst suffer assert sleep more dreaming bathing run stream green bank tree awoke find arid wilderness remember say find water day perish human creature live water heat sit rub grimy face dry horny hand lip eyelid stick friction effort able open dawn be bright feel dawn air thick hot murkiness describe other sleep 
3,"Presently it began to grow light enough to read, so I drew out a little pocket copy of the ""Ingoldsby Legends"" which I had brought with me, and read ""The Jackdaw of Rheims."" When I got to where",begin grow light read draw little pocket copy bring read get

5,"literally I smacked my cracking lips, or rather tried to smack them. The mere thought of that pure water made me mad. If the Cardinal had been there with his bell, book, and candle, I would have whipped in and drunk his water up; yes, even if he had filled it already with the suds of soap ""worthy of washing the hands of the Pope,"" and I knew that the whole consecrated curse of the Catholic Church should fall upon me for so doing. I almost think that I must have been a little light-headed with thirst, weariness and the want of food; for I fell to thinking how astonished the Cardinal and his nice little boy and the jackdaw would have looked to see a burnt up, brown-eyed, grizzly-haired little elephant hunter suddenly bound between them, put his dirty face into the basin, and swallow every drop of the precious water. The idea amused me so much that I laughed or rather cackled aloud, which woke the others, and they began to rub _their_ dirty faces and drag _their_ gummed-up lips and eyelids apart.",smack cracking lip try smack mere thought pure water make mad bell book candle whip drink water fill sud soap worthy wash hand know whole consecrate curse catholic fall do think little light head thirst weariness want food fall think astonished nice little boy jackdaw look see burn brown eyed grizzly hair little elephant hunter bind put dirty face basin swallow drop precious water idea amuse much laugh cackle wake other begin rub _their_ dirty face drag _their_ gumm lip eyelid 
6,"As soon as we were all well awake we began to discuss the situation, which was serious enough. Not a drop of water was left. We turned the bottles upside down, and licked their tops, but it was a failure; they were dry as a bone. Good, who had charge of the flask of brandy, got it out and looked at it longingly; but Sir Henry promptly took it away from him, for to drink raw spirit would only have been to precipitate the end.",awake begin discuss situation serious drop water leave turn bottle lick top failure dry bone good have charge flask brandy get look take drink raw spirit precipitate end 
7,"""If we do not find water we shall die,"" he said.",find water die say 
8,"""If we can trust to the old Dom's map there should be some about,"" I said; but nobody seemed to derive much satisfaction from this remark. It was so evident that no great faith could be put in the map. Now it was gradually growing light, and as we sat staring blankly at each other, I observed the Hottentot Ventvögel rise and begin to walk about with his eyes on the ground. Presently he stopped short, and uttering a guttural exclamation, pointed to the earth.",trust old map be say seem derive much satisfaction remark evident great faith put map grow light sit stare other observe rise begin walk eye ground stop short utter guttural exclamation point earth

On a dark night a single star is better than nothing.",little discovery put new life wonderful man desperate position catch slight hope feel happy dark night single star good 
14,"Meanwhile Ventvögel was lifting his snub nose, and sniffing the hot air for all the world like an old Impala ram who scents danger. Presently he spoke again.",lift snub nose sniff hot air world old ram scent danger speak

17,"Just at that moment the sun came up gloriously, and revealed so grand a sight to our astonished eyes that for a moment or two we even forgot our thirst.",moment sun come reveal grand sight astonished eye moment forget thirst 
18,"There, not more than forty or fifty miles from us, glittering like silver in the early rays of the morning sun, soared Sheba's Breasts; and stretching away for hundreds of miles on either side of them ran the great Suliman Berg. Now that, sitting here, I attempt to describe the extraordinary grandeur and beauty of that sight, language seems to fail me. I am impotent even before its memory. Straight before us, rose two enormous mountains, the like of which are not, I believe, to be seen in Africa, if indeed there are any other such in the world, measuring each of them at least fifteen thousand feet in height, standing not more than a dozen miles apart, linked together by a precipitous cliff of rock, and towering in awful white solemnity straight into the sky. These mountains placed thus, like the pillars of a gigantic gateway, are shaped after the fashion of a woman's breasts, and at times the mists and shadows beneath them take the form of a recumbent woman, veiled mysteriously in sleep. Their bases swell gently from the plain, looking at that distance perfectly round and smooth; and upon the top of each is a vast hillock covered with snow, exactly corresponding to the nipple on the female breast. The stretch of cliff that connects them appears to be some thousands of feet in height, and perfectly precipitous, and on each flank of them, so far as the eye can reach, extent similar lines of cliff, broken only here and there by flat table-topped mountains, something like the world-famed one at Cape Town; a formation, by the way, that is very common in Africa.",more mile glitter silver early ray morning sun soar breast stretch hundred mile side run great sit attempt describe extraordinary grandeur beauty sight language seem fail impotent memory rise enormous mountain like believe see be other such world measure least foot height stand more mile link precipitous cliff rock tower awful white solemnity sky mountain place pillar gigantic gateway shape fashion woman breast time mist shadow take form recumbent woman veil sleep basis swell plain look distance smooth top vast hillock cover snow corresponding nipple female breast stretch cliff connect appear thousand foot height precipitous flank eye reach extent similar line cliff break flat table top mountain world famed formation way common 
19,"To describe the comprehensive grandeur of that view is beyond my powers. There was something so inexpressibly solemn and overpowering about those huge volcanoes--for doubtless they are extinct volcanoes--that it quite awed us. For a while the morning lights played upon the snow and the brown and swelling masses beneath, and then, as though to veil the majestic sight from our curious eyes, strange vapours and clouds gathered and increased around the mountains, till presently we could only trace their pure and gigantic outlines, showing ghostlike through the fleecy envelope. Indeed, as we afterwards discovered, usually they were wrapped in this gauze-like mist, which doubtless accounted for our not having seen them more clearly before.",describe comprehensive grandeur view power be solemn overpowering huge volcano extinct volcano awe while morning light play snow brown swell mass veil majestic sight curious eye strange vapour cloud gather increase mountain trace pure gigantic outline show ghostlike fleecy envelope discover wrap gauze mist account see

21,"It was all very well for Ventvögel to say that he smelt water, but we could see no signs of it, look which way we would. So far as the eye might reach there was nothing but arid sweltering sand and karoo scrub. We walked round the hillock and gazed about anxiously on the other side, but it was the same story, not a drop of water could be found; there was no indication of a pan, a pool, or a spring.",say smell water see sign look way eye reach arid swelter sand karoo scrub walk hillock gaze other side same story drop water find be indication pan pool spring

29,"""_Nanzia manzie_!"" that is, ""Here is water!"" he cried with a loud voice.",water cry loud voice 
30,"We rushed up to him, and there, sure enough, in a deep cut or indentation on the very top of the sand koppie, was an undoubted pool of water. How it came to be in such a strange place we did not stop to inquire, nor did we hesitate at its black and unpleasant appearance. It was water, or a good imitation of it, and that was enough for us. We gave a bound and a rush, and in another second we were all down on our stomachs sucking up the uninviting fluid as though it were nectar fit for the gods. Heavens, how we did drink! Then when we had done drinking we tore off our clothes and sat down in the pool, absorbing the moisture through our parched skins. You, Harry, my boy, who have only to turn on a couple of taps to summon ""hot"" and ""cold"" from an unseen, vasty cistern, can have little idea of the luxury of that muddy wallow in brackish tepid water.",rush sure deep cut indentation very top sand koppie undoubted pool water come strange place stop inquire hesitate black unpleasant appearance water good imitation enough give bind rush second stomach suck uninviting fluid nectar fit god heavens drink do drink tore clothes sit pool absorb moisture parched skin boy have turn couple tap summon hot cold unseen vasty cistern have little idea luxury muddy wallow brackish tepid water 
31,"After a while we rose from it, refreshed indeed, and fell to on our ""biltong,"" of which we had scarcely been able to touch a mouthful for twenty-four hours, and ate our fill. Then we smoked a pipe, and lay down by the side of that blessed pool, under the overhanging shadow of its bank, and slept till noon.",while rise refresh fall biltong able touch mouthful hour eat fill smoke pipe lay side bless pool overhanging shadow bank sleep noon 
32,"All that day we rested there by the water, thanking our stars that we had been lucky enough to find it, bad as it was, and not forgetting to render a due share of gratitude to the shade of the long-departed da Silvestra, who had set its position down so accurately on the tail of his shirt. The wonderful thing to us was that the pan should have lasted so long, and the only way in which I can account for this is on the supposition that it is fed by some spring deep down in the sand.",day rest water thank star lucky find bad forget render due share gratitude shade long depart set position tail shirt wonderful thing pan last only way account supposition feed spring sand 
33,"Having filled both ourselves and our water-bottles as full as possible, in far better spirits we started off again with the moon. That night we covered nearly five-and-twenty miles; but, needless to say, found no more water, though we were lucky enough the following day to get a little shade behind some ant-heaps. When the sun rose, and, for awhile, cleared away the mysterious mists, Suliman's Berg with the two majestic Breasts, now only about twenty miles off, seemed to be towering right above us, and looked grander than ever. At the approach of evening we marched again, and, to cut a long story short, by daylight next morning found ourselves upon the lowest slopes of Sheba's left breast, for which we had been steadily steering. By this time our water was exhausted once more, and we were suffering severely from thirst, nor indeed could we see any chance of relieving it till we reached the snow line far, far above us. After resting an hour or two, driven to it by our torturing thirst, we went on, toiling painfully in the burning heat up the lava slopes, for we found that the huge base of the mountain was composed entirely of lava beds belched from the bowels of the earth in some far past age.",fill water bottle full possible good spirit start moon night cover mile needless say find more water lucky follow day get little shade ant heap sun rise clear mysterious mist majestic breast mile seem tower look grander approach evening march cut long story short daylight next morning find low slope left breast steering time water exhaust more suffer thirst see chance relieve reach snow line rest hour drive torture thirst go toil burning heat lava slope find huge base mountain compose lava bed belch bowel earth past age 
34,"By eleven o'clock we were utterly exhausted, and, generally speaking, in a very bad state indeed. The lava clinker, over which we must drag ourselves, though smooth compared with some clinker I have heard of, such as that on the Island of Ascension, for instance, was yet rough enough to make our feet very sore, and this, together with our other miseries, had pretty well finished us. A few hundred yards above us were some large lumps of lava, and towards these we steered with the intention of lying down beneath their shade. We reached them, and to our surprise, so far as we had a capacity for surprise left in us, on a little plateau or ridge close by we saw that the clinker was covered with a dense green growth. Evidently soil formed of decomposed lava had rested there, and in due course had become the receptacle of seeds deposited by birds. But we did not take much further interest in the green growth, for one cannot live on grass like Nebuchadnezzar. That requires a special dispensation of Providence and peculiar digestive organs.",o'clock exhaust speak bad state lava clinker drag smooth compare clinker hear such instance rough make foot sore other misery finish few yard large lump lava steer intention lie shade reach surprise have capacity surprise leave little plateau ridge see clinker cover dense green growth soil form decompose lava rest due course become receptacle seed deposit bird take much further interest green growth live grass require special dispensation peculiar digestive organ 
35,"So we sat down under the rocks and groaned, and for one I wished heartily that we had never started on this fool's errand. As we were sitting there I saw Umbopa get up and hobble towards the patch of green, and a few minutes afterwards, to my great astonishment, I perceived that usually very dignified individual dancing and shouting like a maniac, and waving something green. Off we all scrambled towards him as fast as our wearied limbs would carry us, hoping that he had found water.",sit rock groan wish start fool errand sit see get hobble patch green few minute great astonishment perceive dignified individual dancing shouting maniac wave green scramble weary limb carry hope find water

37,"""It is food and water, Macumazahn,"" and again he waved the green thing.",food water wave green thing 
38,"Then I saw what he had found. It was a melon. We had hit upon a patch of wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.",see find melon hit patch wild melon thousand dead ripe

40,"I think we ate about six each before we had done, and poor fruit as they were, I doubt if I ever thought anything nicer.",think eat do poor fruit doubt think nice 
41,"But melons are not very nutritious, and when we had satisfied our thirst with their pulpy substance, and put a stock to cool by the simple process of cutting them in two and setting them end on in the hot sun to grow cold by evaporation, we began to feel exceedingly hungry. We had still some biltong left, but our stomachs turned from biltong, and besides, we were obliged to be very sparing of it, for we could not say when we should find more food. Just at this moment a lucky thing chanced. Looking across the desert I saw a flock of about ten large birds flying straight towards us.",melon nutritious satisfy thirst pulpy substance put stock cool simple process cut set end hot sun grow cold evaporation begin feel hungry have biltong left stomach turn biltong oblige sparing say find more food moment lucky thing chance look desert see flock large bird fly 
42,"""_Skit, Baas, skit!_"" ""Shoot, master, shoot!"" whispered the Hottentot, throwing himself on his face, an example which we all followed.",skit shoot master shoot whisper throw face example follow 
43,"Then I saw that the birds were a flock of _pauw_ or bustards, and that they would pass within fifty yards of my head. Taking one of the repeating Winchesters, I waited till they were nearly over us, and then jumped to my feet. On seeing me the _pauw_ bunched up together, as I expected that they would, and I fired two shots straight into the thick of them, and, as luck would have it, brought one down, a fine fellow, that weighed about twenty pounds. In half an hour we had a fire made of dry melon stalks, and he was toasting over it, and we made such a feed as we had not tasted for a week. We ate that _pauw_; nothing was left of him but his leg-bones and his beak, and we felt not a little the better afterwards.",see bird flock _pauw_ bustard pass yard head take repeat wait jump foot see _pauw_ bunch expect fire shot thick luck have bring fine fellow weigh pound hour have fire make dry melon stalk toast make feed taste week eat _pauw_ leave leg bone beak feel little good 
44,"That night we went on again with the moon, carrying as many melons as we could with us. As we ascended we found the air grew cooler and cooler, which was a great relief to us, and at dawn, so far as we could judge, we were not more than about a dozen miles from the snow line. Here we discovered more melons, and so had no longer any anxiety about water, for we knew that we should soon get plenty of snow. But the ascent had now become very precipitous, and we made but slow progress, not more than a mile an hour. Also that night we ate our last morsel of biltong. As yet, with the exception of the _pauw_, we had seen no living thing on the mountain, nor had we come across a single spring or stream of water, which struck us as very odd, considering the expanse of snow above us, which must, we thought, melt sometimes. But as we afterwards discovered, owing to a cause which it is quite beyond my power to explain, all the streams flowed down upon the north side of the mountains.",night go moon carry many melon ascend find air grow cool cool great relief dawn judge more mile snow line discover more melon have anxiety water know get plenty snow ascent become precipitous make slow progress more mile hour night eat last morsel biltong exception _pauw_ see living thing mountain come single spring stream water strike odd consider expanse snow think melt discover ow cause power explain stream flow north side mountain

We are now in a dreadful plight, and I fear that unless we get food this will be our last day's journey. But little brandy left. Good, Sir Henry, and Umbopa bear up wonderfully, but Ventvögel is in a very bad way. Like most Hottentots, he cannot stand cold. Pangs of hunger not so bad, but have a sort of numb feeling about the stomach. Others say the same. We are now on a level with the precipitous chain, or wall of lava, linking the two Breasts, and the view is glorious. Behind us the glowing desert rolls away to the horizon, and before us lie mile upon mile of smooth hard snow almost level, but swelling gently upwards, out of the centre of which the nipple of the mountain, that appears to be some miles in circumference, rises about four thousand feet into the sky. Not a living thing is to be seen. God help us; I fear that our time has come.""",23rd struggle sun thaw limb little dreadful plight fear get food last day journey little brandy leave good bear bad way most stand cold pang hunger bad have sort numb feeling stomach other say same level precipitous chain wall lava link breast view glorious glow desert roll horizon lie mile mile smooth hard snow level swell centre nipple mountain appear mile circumference rise foot sky living thing see help fear time come

50,"All that day--the 23rd May--we struggled slowly up the incline of snow, lying down from time to time to rest. A strange gaunt crew we must have looked, while, laden as we were, we dragged our weary feet over the dazzling plain, glaring round us with hungry eyes. Not that there was much use in glaring, for we could see nothing to eat. We did not accomplish more than seven miles that day. Just before sunset we found ourselves exactly under the nipple of Sheba's left Breast, which towered thousands of feet into the air, a vast smooth hillock of frozen snow. Weak as we were, we could not but appreciate the wonderful scene, made even more splendid by the flying rays of light from the setting sun, which here and there stained the snow blood-red, and crowned the great dome above us with a diadem of glory.",day 23rd struggle incline snow lie time time rest strange gaunt crew look laden drag weary foot dazzling plain glaring hungry eye be much use glaring see eat accomplish more mile day sunset find nipple left tower thousand foot air vast smooth hillock freeze snow weak appreciate wonderful scene make splendid fly ray light setting sun stain snow blood red crown great dome diadem glory

58,"""It is the cave,"" said Umbopa.",cave say 
59,"We made the best of our way to the spot, and found sure enough that the hole was the mouth of a cavern, no doubt the same as that of which da Silvestra wrote. We were not too soon, for just as we reached shelter the sun went down with startling rapidity, leaving the world nearly dark, for in these latitudes there is but little twilight. So we crept into the cave, which did not appear to be very big, and huddling ourselves together for warmth, swallowed what remained of our brandy--barely a mouthful each--and tried to forget our miseries in sleep. But the cold was too intense to allow us to do so, for I am convinced that at this great altitude the thermometer cannot have marked less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below freezing point. What such a temperature meant to us, enervated as we were by hardship, want of food, and the great heat of the desert, the reader may imagine better than I can describe. Suffice it to say that it was something as near death from exposure as I have ever felt. There we sat hour after hour through the still and bitter night, feeling the frost wander round and nip us now in the finger, now in the foot, now in the face. In vain did we huddle up closer and closer; there was no warmth in our miserable starved carcases. Sometimes one of us would drop into an uneasy slumber for a few minutes, but we could not sleep much, and perhaps this was fortunate, for if we had I doubt if we should have ever woke again.

Also it looked upon Ventvögel, sitting there amongst us, _stone dead_. No wonder his back felt cold, poor fellow. He had died when I heard him sigh, and was now frozen almost stiff. Shocked beyond measure, we dragged ourselves from the corpse--how strange is that horror we mortals have of the companionship of a dead body--and left it sitting there, its arms clasped about its knees.",length air begin grow grey light golden arrow spe snow last glorious sun peep lava wall look half freeze form look sit wonder back feel cold poor fellow die hear sigh freeze stiff shocked measure drag corpse strange horror mortal have companionship dead body leave sit arm clasp knee
