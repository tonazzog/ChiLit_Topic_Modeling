1,CHAPTER 10. THE FOURTH JUNIOR AT HOME.,fourth 
2,"Stephen, before he had been a fortnight in the school, found himself very much at home at Saint Dominic's.  He was not one of those exuberant, irrepressible boys who take their class-fellows by storm, and rise to the top of the tree almost as soon as they touch the bottom. Stephen, as the reader knows, was not a very clever boy, or a very dashing boy, and yet he somehow managed to get his footing among his comrades in the Fourth Junior, and particularly among his fellow Guinea-pigs.",fortnight school find home exuberant irrepressible boy take class fellow storm rise top tree touch bottom reader know clever boy dash boy manage get footing comrade fourth fellow guinea pig 
3,"He had fought Master Bramble six times in three days during his second week, and was engaged to fight him again every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday during the term.  He had also taken the chair at one indignation meeting against the monitors, and spoken in favour of a resolution at another.  He had distributed brandy-balls in a most handsome manner to his particular adherents, and he had been the means of carrying away no less than two blankets from the next dormitory.  This was pretty good for a fortnight.  Add to this that he had remained steadily at the bottom of his class during the entire period, and that once he had received an ""impot"" (or imposition) from Mr Rastle, and it will easily be understood that he soon gained favour among his fellows.",fight time day second week engage fight term take chair indignation meeting monitor speak favour resolution distribute brandy ball handsome manner particular adherent means carry less blanket next dormitory good fortnight add remain bottom class entire period receive impot imposition understand gain favour fellow 
4,"This last cause of celebrity, however, was one which did not please Stephen.  He had come to Saint Dominic's with a great quantity of good resolutions, the chief of which was that he would work hard and keep out of mischief, and it grieved him much to find that in neither aim was he succeeding.",last cause celebrity please come great quantity good resolution chief work keep mischief grieve much find aim succeed 
5,"The first evening or two he had worked very diligently at preparation. He had taken pains with his fractions, and looked out every word in his Caesar.  He had got Oliver to look over his French, and Loman had volunteered to correct the spelling of his ""theme;"" and yet he stuck at the bottom of the class.  Other boys went up and down.  Some openly boasted that they had had their lessons done for them, and others that they had not done them at all.  A merry time they had of it; but Stephen, down at the bottom, was in dismal dumps.  He could not get up, and he could not get down, and all his honest hard work went for nothing.",first evening work preparation take pain fraction look word get look volunteer correct spelling theme stick bottom class other boy go boast have lesson do other do merry time have bottom dismal dump get get honest hard work go 
6,"And so, not content to give that system a longer trial, he grew more lax in his work.  He filched the answers to his sums out of the ""Key,"" and copied his Caesar out of the ""crib.""  It was much easier, and the result was the same.  He did not get up, and he could not get down.",content give system long trial grow lax work filch answer sum copy crib easy result same get get 
7,"Oliver catechised him now and then as to his progress, and received vague answers in reply, and Loman never remembered a fag that pestered him less with lessons.  Stephen was, in fact, settling down into the slough of idleness, and would have become an accomplished dunce in time, had not Mr Rastle come to the rescue.  That gentleman caught the new boy in an idle mood, wandering aimlessly down the passage one afternoon.",catechise progress receive vague answer reply remember fag pester less lesson fact settle slough idleness become accomplish dunce time come rescue gentleman catch new boy idle mood wonder passage afternoon 
8,"""Ah, Greenfield, is that you?  Nothing to do, eh?  Come and have tea with me, will you, in my room?""",do come have tea room 
9,"Stephen, who had bounded as if shot on hearing the master's unexpected voice behind him, turned round and blushed very red, and said ""Thank you,"" and then looked like a criminal just summoned to the gallows.",bound shoot hear master unexpected voice turn blush red say thank look criminal summon gallow 
10,"""That's right, come along;"" and the master took the lad by the arm and marched him off to his room.",right come master take lad arm march room 
11,"Here the sight of muffins and red-currant jam, in addition to the ordinary attractions of a tea-table, somewhat revived Stephen's drooping spirits.",sight muffin red currant jam addition ordinary attraction tea table revive drooping spirit 
12,"""Make yourself comfortable, my boy, while the tea is brewing,"" said Mr Rastle, cheerily.  ""Have you been playing any cricket since you came?""",make comfortable boy tea brew say play cricket come 
13,"""Only a little, sir,"" said Stephen.",little sir say 
14,"""Well, if you only turn out as good a bat as your brother--how well he played in the Alphabet Match!""",turn good bat brother play 
15,"Stephen was reviving fast now, and embarked on a lively chat about his favourite sport, by the end of which the tea was brewed, and he and Mr Rastle sitting ""cheek by jowl"" at the table, with the muffins and jam between them.",revive embark lively chat favourite sport end tea brew sit cheek jowl table muffin jam 
16,"Presently Mr Rastle steered the talk round to Stephen's home, a topic even more delightful than cricket.  The boy launched out into a full account of the old house and his mother, till the tears very nearly stood in his eyes and the muffins very nearly stuck in his throat.  Mr Rastle listened to it all with a sympathetic smile, throwing in questions now and then which it charmed the boy to answer.",steer talk home topic delightful cricket boy launch full account old house mother tear stand eye muffin stuck throat listen sympathetic smile throw question charm boy answer 
17,"""And how do you like Saint Dominic's?"" presently inquired the master. ""I suppose you've made plenty of friends by this time?""",like inquire master suppose make plenty friend time 
18,"""Oh yes, sir.  It's not as slow as it was at first.""",sir slow first 
19,"""That's right.  You'll soon get to feel at home.  And how do you think you are getting on in class?""",right get feel home think get class 
20,"Stephen was astonished at this question.  If any one knew how he was getting on in class Mr Rastle did, and, alas!  Mr Rastle must know well enough that Stephen was getting on badly.",astonished question one know get class know get 
21,"""Not very well, I'm afraid, sir, thank you,"" replied the boy, not feeling exactly comfortable.",afraid sir thank reply boy feel comfortable 
22,"""Not?  That's a pity.  Are the lessons too hard for you?"" kindly inquired Mr Rastle.",pity lesson hard inquire 
23,"""No, I don't think so--that is--no, they're not, sir.""",think sir 
24,"""Ah, your Latin exercise I thought was very fair in parts to-day.""",latin exercise think fair part day 
25,"Stephen stared at his master, and the master looked very pleasantly at Stephen.",stare master master look 
26,"""I copied it off Raddleston,"" said the boy, in a trembling voice, and mentally resigning himself to his fate.",copy say boy tremble voice resign fate 
27,"""Ah!"" said Mr Rastle, laughing; ""it's a funny thing, now, Greenfield, I knew that myself.  No two boys could possibly have translated `nobody' into `_nullus corpus_' without making common cause!""",say laugh funny thing know boy translate make common cause 
28,"Stephen was desperately perplexed.  He had expected a regular row on the head of his confession, and here was his master cracking jokes about the affair!",perplexed expect regular row head confession master cracking joke affair 
29,"""I'm very sorry I did it.  I won't do it again,"" said he.  ""That's right, my boy; Raddleston isn't infallible.  Much better do it yourself. I venture to say, now, you can tell me what the Latin for `nobody' is without a dictionary.""",sorry do do say right boy infallible do venture say tell dictionary 
30,"""_Nemo_,"" promptly replied Stephen.",reply 
31,"""Of course! and therefore if you had done the exercise yourself you wouldn't have made that horrid--that fearful mistake!""",course do exercise make horrid fearful mistake 
32,"Stephen said, ""Yes, sir,"" and meditated.",say sir meditate 
33,"""Come now,"" said Mr Rastle, cheerily, ""I'm not going to scold you.  But if you take my advice you will try and do the next exercise by yourself. Of course you can't expect to be perfect all at once, but if you always copy off Raddleston, do you see, you'll _never_ get on at all.""",come say go scold take advice try do next exercise course expect perfect copy see get 
34,"""I'll try, sir,"" said Stephen, meaning what he said.",try sir say mean say 
35,"""I know you will, my boy.  It's not easy work to begin with, but it's easier far in the long run.  Try, and if you have difficulties, as you are sure to have, come to me.  I'm always here in the evenings, and we'll hammer it out between us.  School will not be without its temptations, and you will find it hard always to do your duty.  Yet you have, I hope, learnt the power of prayer; and surely the Saviour is able not only to forgive us our sins, but also to keep us from falling.  At school, my boy, as elsewhere, it is a safe rule, whenever one is in doubt, to avoid everything, no matter who may be the tempter, of which one cannot fearlessly speak to one's father or mother, and above all to our Heavenly Father.  Don't be afraid of Him--He will always be ready to help you and to guide you with His Holy Spirit.  Have another cup of tea?""",know boy easy work begin easy long run try have difficulty sure have come evening hammer school temptation find hard do duty hope learn power prayer able forgive sin keep fall school boy safe rule one doubt avoid matter tempter speak father mother heavenly afraid ready help guide holy have cup tea 
36,"This little talk, much as he missed at the time its deeper meaning, saved Stephen from becoming a dunce.  He still blundered and boggled over his lessons, and still kept pretty near to the bottom form in his class, but he felt that his master had an interest in him, and that acted like magic to his soul.  He declined Master Raddleston's professional assistance for the future, and did the best he could by himself.  He now and then, though hesitatingly, availed himself of Mr Rastle's offer, and took his difficulties to head-quarters; and he always, when he did so, found the master ready and glad to help, and not only that, but to explain as he went along, and clear the way of future obstacles of the same sort.",little talk much miss time deep meaning save become dunce blunder boggle lesson keep bottom form class feel master have interest act magic soul decline professional assistance future do good avail offer take difficulty head quarter find master ready glad help explain go clear way future obstacle same sort 
37,"And so things looked up with Stephen.  He wrote jubilant letters home; he experienced all the joys of an easy conscience, and he felt that he had a friend at court.",thing look write jubilant letter experience joy easy conscience feel have friend court 
38,"But as long as he was a member of the honourable fraternity of Guinea-pigs, Stephen Greenfield was not likely to be dull at Saint Dominic's.",member honourable fraternity pig likely dull 
39,"The politics of the lower school were rather intricate.  The Guinea-pigs were not exactly the enemies of the Tadpoles, but the rivals.  They were always jangling among themselves, it was true; and when Stephen, for the second time in one week, had hit Bramble in the eye, there was such jubilation among the Guinea-pigs that any one might have supposed the two clans were at daggers drawn.  But it was not so--at least, not always--for though they fell out among themselves, they united their forces against the common enemy--the monitors!",politics low school intricate guinea pig enemy rival jangle true second time week hit eye be such jubilation guinea pig one suppose clan dagger draw least fall unite force common enemy monitor 
40,"Monitors, in the opinion of these young republicans, were an invention of the Evil One, invented for the sole purpose of interfering with them. But for the monitors they could carry out their long-cherished scheme of a pitched battle on the big staircase, for asserting their right to go down the left side, when they chose, and up on the right.  As it was, the monitors insisted that they should go up on the left and come down on the right.  It was intolerable tyranny!  And but for the monitors their comb-and-paper musical society might give daily recitals in the top corridor and so delight all Saint Dominic's.  What right had the monitors to forbid the performance and confiscate the combs?  Was it to be endured?  And but for the monitors, once more, they might perfect themselves in the art of pea-shooting.  Was such a thing ever heard of, as that fellows should be compelled to shoot peas at the wall in the privacy of their own studies, instead of at one another in the passages? It was a shame--it was a scandal--it was a crime!",monitor opinion young invention evil invent sole purpose interfere monitor carry long cherish scheme pitch battle big staircase assert right go left side choose right monitor insist go left come right intolerable tyranny monitor comb paper musical society give daily recital top corridor delight right have monitor forbid performance confiscate comb endure monitor more perfect art pea-shooting thing hear fellow compel shoot pea wall privacy own study passage shame scandal crime 
41,"On burning questions such as these, Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles sunk all petty differences, and thought and felt as one man; and not the least ardent among them was Stephen.",burn question such guinea pig tadpole sink petty difference think feel man least ardent 
42,"""Come on, quick!  Greenfield junior,"" squeaked the voice of Bramble, one afternoon, as he and Stephen met on the staircase.",come quick junior squeak voice afternoon meet staircase 
43,"Stephen had fought Bramble yesterday at four o'clock, and was to fight him again to-morrow at half-past twelve, but at the call of common danger he forgot the feud and tore up the stairs, two steps at a time, beside his chronic enemy.",fight yesterday o'clock fight half call common danger forget feud tore stair step time chronic enemy 
44,"""What's the row?"" he gasped, as they flew along.",row gasp fly 
45,"""Row?  Why, what do you think?  Young Bellerby has been doctored for tying a string across the passage!""",row think young doctore tie string passage 
46,"""Had up before the Doctor?  My eye, Bramble!""",have eye 
47,"""It is your eye indeed!  One of the monitors tripped over it, and got in a rage, and there's Bellerby now catching it in the Black Hole.  Come on to the meeting; quick!""",eye monitor trip get rage be catching black come meeting quick 
48,"The two rushed on, joined by one and another of their fellows who had heard the terrible news.  The party rushed pellmell into the Fourth Junior class-room, where were already assembled a score or more youths, shouting, and stamping, and howling like madmen.  At the sight of Bramble, the acknowledged leader of all malcontents, they quieted down for a moment to hear what he had to say.",rush join fellow hear terrible news party rush pellmell fourth class room assemble score more youth shouting stamp howl madmen sight acknowledge leader malcontent quiet moment hear have say 
49,"""Here's a go!"" classically began that hero.",go begin hero 
50,"At this the clamour, swelled twofold by the new additions, rose louder than ever.  It _was_ a go!",clamour swell twofold new addition rise go 
51,"""I wish it had been _me_!"" again yelled Bramble; ""I have let them know.""",wish yell let know 
52,Once more the shouts rose high and loud in approval of this noble sentiment.,shout rise high loud approval noble sentiment 
53,"""_I'd_ have kicked their legs!"" once more howled Bramble, as soon as he could make himself heard.",kick leg howl make hear 
54,"""So would we; kicked their legs!""",kick leg 
55,"""They ought to be hanged!"" screamed Bramble.",hang scream 
56,"""_I'll_ not fag any more for Wren!"" bellowed Bramble.",fig more bellow 
57,"""I'll not fag any more for Greenfield senior!"" thundered Paul.",fig more senior thunder 
58,"""I'll not fag any more for Loman!"" shrieked Stephen.",fig more shriek

64,"""Those who say we won't stand it any longer,"" shouted Bramble, jumping up on to a form, ""hold up your hands!""",say stand shout jump form hold hand 
65,"A perfect forest of inky hands arose, and a shout with them that almost shook the ceiling.",perfect forest inky hand arise shout shake ceiling 
66,"At that moment the door opened, and Wren appeared.  The effect was magical; every one became suddenly quiet, and looked another way.",moment door open appear effect magical one become quiet look way 
67,"""The next time there's a noise like that,"" said the monitor, ""the whole class will be detained one hour,"" and, so saying, departed.",next time be noise say monitor whole class detain hour say depart 
68,"After that the indignation meeting was kept up in whispers.  Now and then the feelings of the assembly broke out into words, but the noise was instantly checked.",indignation meeting keep whisper feeling assembly break word noise check 
69,"""If young Bellerby has been flogged,"" said Bramble, in a most sepulchral undertone, ""I've a good mind to fight every one of them!""",young flogge say sepulchral undertone have good mind fight

75,"""Where's young Raddleston?--What _are_ you young beggars up to?--is Raddleston here?""",young _are_ young beggar 
76,"""Yes,"" mildly answered the voice of Master Raddleston, who a moment ago had nearly broken a blood-vessel in his endeavours to scream in a whisper.",answer voice moment break blood vessel endeavour scream whisper

79,"""Oh, and Greenfield junior,"" said Callonby, as he was turning to depart, ""Loman wants to know when you are going to get his tea; you're to go at once, he says.""",junior say turn depart want know go get tea go say 
80,"Stephen obeyed, and was very humble in explaining to Loman that he had forgotten (which was the case) the time.  The meeting in the Fourth class-room lasted most of the afternoon; but as oratory in whispers is tedious, and constant repetition of the same sentiments, however patriotic, is monotonous, it flagged considerably in spirit towards the end, and degenerated into one of the usual wrangles between Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, in the midst of which Master Bramble left the chair, and went off in the meekest manner possible to get Wren to help him with his sums for next day.",obey humble explain forget case time meeting fourth class room last most afternoon oratory whisper tedious constant repetition same sentiment patriotic monotonous flagge spirit end degenerate usual wrangle guinea pig midst leave chair go meekest manner possible get help sum next day
