3,"Then there was a pause, and we stood there in the chilly silent darkness waiting till the moment came to start. It was, perhaps, the most trying time of all--that slow, slow quarter of an hour. The minutes seemed to drag along with leaden feet, and the quiet, the solemn hush, that brooded over all--big, as it were, with a coming fate, was most oppressive to the spirits. I once remember having to get up before dawn to see a man hanged, and I then went through a very similar set of sensations, only in the present instance my feelings were animated by that more vivid and personal element which naturally appertains rather to the person to be operated on than to the most sympathetic spectator. The solemn faces of the men, well aware that the short passage of an hour would mean for some, and perhaps all of them, the last great passage to the unknown or oblivion; the bated whispers in which they spoke; even Sir Henry’s continuous and thoughtful examination of his woodcutter’s axe and the fidgety way in which Good kept polishing his eyeglass, all told the same tale of nerves stretched pretty nigh to breaking-point. Only Umslopogaas, leaning as usual upon Inkosi-kaas and taking an occasional pinch of snuff, was to all appearance perfectly and completely unmoved. Nothing could touch his iron nerves.",be pause stand chilly silent darkness wait moment come start try time slow slow quarter hour minute seem drag leaden foot quiet solemn hush brood big come fate oppressive spirit remember have get dawn see man hang go similar set sensation present instance feeling animate vivid personal element appertain person operate sympathetic spectator solemn face man aware short passage hour mean last great passage unknown oblivion bate whisper speak continuous thoughtful examination woodcutter axe fidgety way keep polish eyeglass tell same tale nerve stretch nigh breaking point lean usual take occasional pinch snuff appearance unmoved touch iron nerve 
4,The moon went down. For a long while she had been getting nearer and nearer to the horizon. Now she finally sank and left the world in darkness save for a faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely heralded the dawn.,moon go long while get nearer horizon sink leave world darkness save faint grey tinge eastern sky herald dawn

7,"Good gave one final polish to his eyeglass, nodded to us in a jocular sort of way--which I could not help feeling it must have cost him something to muster up--and, ever polite, took off his steel-lined cap to Mrs Mackenzie and started for his position at the head of the kraal, to reach which he had to make a detour by some paths known to the natives.",good give final polish eyeglass nod jocular sort way help feel cost muster polite take steel line cap start position head kraal reach have make detour path know native 
8,"Just then one of the boys came in and reported that everybody in the Masai camp, with the exception of the two sentries who were walking up and down in front of the respective entrances, appeared to be fast asleep. Then the rest of us took the road. First came the guide, then Sir Henry, Umslopogaas, the Wakwafi Askari, and Mr Mackenzie’s two mission natives armed with long spears and shields. I followed immediately after with Alphonse and five natives all armed with guns, and Mr Mackenzie brought up the rear with the six remaining natives.",boy come report camp exception sentry walk front respective entrance appear fast asleep rest take road come guide mission native arm long spear shield follow native arm gun bring rear remain native 
9,"The cattle kraal where the Masai were camped lay at the foot of the hill on which the house stood, or, roughly speaking, about eight hundred yards from the Mission buildings. The first five hundred yards of this distance we traversed quietly indeed, but at a good pace; after that we crept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey, gliding like ghosts from bush to bush and stone to stone. When I had gone a little way I chanced to look behind me, and saw the redoubtable Alphonse staggering along with white face and trembling knees, and his rifle, which was at full cock, pointed directly at the small of my back. Having halted and carefully put the rifle at ‘safety’, we started again, and all went well till we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal, when his teeth began to chatter in the most aggressive way.",cattle kraal camp lay foot hill house stand speak yard building first yard distance travers good pace creep leopard prey glide ghost bush bush stone stone go little way chance look see redoubtable staggering white face tremble knee rifle full cock point small back halt put rifle safety start go yard kraal tooth begin chatter aggressive way 
10,"‘If you don’t stop that I will kill you,’ I whispered savagely; for the idea of having all our lives sacrificed to a tooth-chattering cook was too much for me. I began to fear that he would betray us, and heartily wished we had left him behind.",stop kill whisper idea have life sacrifice tooth chattering cook much begin fear betray wish leave 
11,"‘But, monsieur, I cannot help it,’ he answered, ‘it is the cold.’",help answer cold 
12,"Here was a dilemma, but fortunately I devised a plan. In the pocket of the coat I had on was a small piece of dirty rag that I had used some time before to clean a gun with. ‘Put this in your mouth,’ I whispered again, giving him the rag; ‘and if I hear another sound you are a dead man.’ I knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth. I must have looked as if I meant what I said, for he instantly obeyed me, and continued his journey in silence.",dilemma devise plan pocket coat have small piece dirty rag use time clean gun put mouth whisper give rag hear sound dead man know stifle clatter tooth look mean say obey continue journey silence 
13,Then we crept on again.,creep 
14,"At last we were within fifty yards of the kraal. Between us and it was an open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of tussocks of a sort of thistle for cover. We were still hidden in fairly thick bush. It was beginning to grow light. The stars had paled and a sickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth. We could see the outline of the kraal clearly enough, and could also make out the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the Masai camp-fires. We halted and watched, for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening. Presently he appeared, a fine tall fellow, walking idly up and down within five paces of the thorn-stopped entrance. We had hoped to catch him napping, but it was not to be. He seemed particularly wide awake. If we could not kill that man, and kill him silently, we were lost. There we crouched and watched him. Presently Umslopogaas, who was a few paces ahead of me, turned and made a sign, and next second I saw him go down on his stomach like a snake, and, taking an opportunity when the sentry’s head was turned, begin to work his way through the grass without a sound.",last yard kraal open space slope grass mimosa bush couple tussock sort thistle cover hide thick bush begin grow light star pale sickly gleam play east reflect earth see outline kraal make faint glimmer die ember camp fire halt watch sentry know post opening appear fine tall fellow walk pace thorn stop entrance hope catch napp seem wide awake kill man kill lose crouch watch few pace turn make sign next second see go stomach snake take opportunity sentry head turn begin work way grass sound 
15,"The unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune, and Umslopogaas crept on. He reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and there waited. Still the sentry walked up and down. Presently he turned and looked over the wall into the camp. Instantly the human snake who was stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks of the thistle-like plant, reaching it as the Elmoran turned again. As he did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles, and it seemed to strike him that it did not look quite right. He advanced a pace towards it--halted, yawned, stooped down, picked up a little pebble and threw it at it. It hit Umslopogaas upon the head, luckily not upon the armour shirt. Had it done so the clink would have betrayed us. Luckily, too, the shirt was browned and not bright steel, which would certainly have been detected. Apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong, he then gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning on his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft. For at least three minutes did he stand thus, plunged apparently in a gentle reverie, and there we lay in the last extremity of anxiety, expecting every moment that we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would happen. I could hear Alphonse’s teeth going like anything on the oiled rag, and turning my head round made an awful face at him. But I am bound to state that my own heart was at much the same game as the Frenchman’s castanets, while the perspiration was pouring from my body, causing the wash-leather-lined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly, and altogether I was in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a ‘blue fright’.",unconscious sentry commence hum little tune creep reach shelter mimosa bush unperceived wait sentry walk turn look wall camp human snake stalk glide yard get tussock thistle like plant reach turn eye fall patch thistle seem strike look right advance pace halt yawn stoop pick little pebble throw hit head armour shirt do clink betray shirt brown bright steel detect satisfy be wrong give investigation content lean spear standing gaze tuft least minute stand plunge gentle reverie lay last extremity anxiety expect moment discover untoward accident happen hear tooth go oiled rag turn head make awful face bound state own heart same game castanet perspiration pour body cause wash leather line shirt stick pitiable state know schoolboy blue fright 
16,"At last the ordeal came to an end. The sentry glanced at the east, and appeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to an end--as indeed it was, once and for all--for he rubbed his hands and began to walk again briskly to warm himself.",last ordeal come end sentry glance east appear note satisfaction period duty come end rub hand begin walk warm

18,"Back came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft, utterly unconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it. Had he looked down he could scarcely have failed to see, but he did not do so.",come sentry stroll tuft unconscious presence crouch look fail see do 
19,"He passed, and then his hidden enemy erected himself, and with outstretched hand followed in his tracks.",pass hidden enemy erect outstretched hand follow track 
20,"A moment more, and, just as the Elmoran was about to turn, the great Zulu made a spring, and in the growing light we could see his long lean hands close round the Masai’s throat. Then followed a convulsive twining of the two dark bodies, and in another second I saw the Masai’s head bent back, and heard a sharp crack, something like that of a dry twig snapping, and he fell down upon the ground, his limbs moving spasmodically.",moment more about turn great make spring grow light see long lean hand close throat follow convulsive twining dark body second see head bend hear sharp crack dry twig snapp fall ground limb move 
21,Umslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warrior’s neck.,put iron strength break warrior neck 
22,"For a moment he knelt upon his victim, still gripping his throat till he was sure that there was nothing more to fear from him, and then he rose and beckoned to us to advance, which we did on all fours, like a colony of huge apes. On reaching the kraal we saw that the Masai had still further choked this entrance, which was about ten feet wide--no doubt in order to guard against attack--by dragging four or five tops of mimosa trees up to it. So much the better for us, I reflected; the more obstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through. Here we separated; Mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow of the wall to the left, while Sir Henry and Umslopogaas took their stations one on each side of the thorn fence, the two spearmen and the Askari lying down in front of it. I and my men crept on up the right side of the kraal, which was about fifty paces long.",moment knolt victim grip throat sure be more fear rise beckon advance do four colony huge ape reach kraal see choke entrance foot wide doubt order guard attack drag top mimosa tree good reflect more obstruction be slow able come separate party creep shadow wall left take station side thorn fence spearmen lie front man creep right side kraal pace 
23,"When I was two-thirds up I halted, and placed my men at distances of four paces from one another, keeping Alphonse close to me, however. Then I peeped for the first time over the wall. It was getting fairly light now, and the first thing I saw was the white donkey, exactly opposite to me, and close by it I could make out the pale face of little Flossie, who was sitting as the lad had described, some ten paces from the wall. Round her lay many warriors, sleeping. At distances all over the surface of the kraal were the remains of fires, round each of which slept some five-and-twenty Masai, for the most part gorged with food. Now and then a man would raise himself, yawn, and look at the east, which was turning primrose; but none got up. I determined to wait another five minutes, both to allow the light to increase, so that we could make better shooting, and to give Good and his party--of whom we could see or hear nothing--every opportunity to make ready.",third halt place man distance pace keep close peep first time wall get light first thing see white donkey opposite make pale face little sit lad describe pace wall lay many warrior sleep distance surface kraal remains fire sleep most part gorge food man raise look east turn primrose get determine wait minute allow light increase make good shooting give good party see hear opportunity make ready 
24,"The quiet dawn began to throw her ever-widening mantle over plain and forest and river--mighty Kenia, wrapped in the silence of eternal snows, looked out across the earth--till presently a beam from the unrisen sun lit upon his heaven-kissing crest and purpled it with blood; the sky above grew blue, and tender as a mother’s smile; a bird began to pipe his morning song, and a little breeze passing through the bush shook down the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world. Everywhere was peace and the happiness of arising strength, everywhere save in the heart of cruel man!",quiet dawn begin throw widen mantle plain forest river mighty wrap silence eternal snow look earth beam unrisen sun light heaven kiss crest purple blood sky grow blue tender mother smile bird begin pipe morning song little breeze pass bush shake dewdrop million refresh wake world peace happiness arise strength save heart cruel man 
25,"Suddenly, just as I was nerving myself for the signal, having already selected my man on whom I meant to open fire--a great fellow sprawling on the ground within three feet of little Flossie--Alphonse’s teeth began to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe, making a great noise in the silence. The rag had dropped out in the agitation of his mind. Instantly a Masai within three paces of us woke, and, sitting up, gazed about him, looking for the cause of the sound. Moved beyond myself, I brought the butt-end of my rifle down on to the pit of the Frenchman’s stomach. This stopped his chattering; but, as he doubled up, he managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed within an inch of my head.",nerve signal select man mean open fire great fellow sprawl ground foot little tooth begin chatter hoof gallop giraffe make great noise silence rag drop agitation mind pace wake sit gaze look cause sound move bring butt end rifle pit stomach stop chattering double manage let gun manner bullet pass inch head 
26,"There was no need for a signal now. From both sides of the kraal broke out a waving line of fire, in which I myself joined, managing with a snap shot to knock over my Masai by Flossie, just as he was jumping up. Then from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell, in which I rejoiced to recognize Good’s piercing notes rising clear and shrill above the din, and in another second followed such a scene as I have never seen before nor shall again. With an universal howl of terror and fury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet, many of them to fall again beneath our well-directed hail of lead before they had moved a yard. For a moment they stood undecided, and then hearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end of the kraal, and bewildered by the storm of bullets, they as by one impulse rushed down towards the thorn-stopped entrance. As they went we kept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as fast as we could load. I had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it contained and was just beginning to slip in some more when I bethought me of little Flossie. Looking up, I saw that the white donkey was lying kicking, having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a Masai spear-thrust. There were no living Masai near, but the black nurse was on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound Flossie’s feet. Next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb over it, an example which the little girl followed. But Flossie was evidently very stiff and cramped, and could only go slowly, and as she went two Masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed towards her to kill her. The first fellow came up just as the poor little girl, after a desperate effort to climb the wall, fell back into the kraal. Up flashed the great spear, and as it did so a bullet from my rifle found its home in the holder’s ribs, and over he went like a shot rabbit. But behind him was the other man, and, alas, I had only that one cartridge in the magazine! Flossie had scrambled to her feet and was facing the second man, who was advancing with raised spear. I turned my head aside and felt sick as death. I could not bear to see him stab her. Glancing up again, to my surprise I saw the Masai’s spear lying on the ground, while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to his head. Suddenly I saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from Flossie, and the man fell down headlong. Then I remembered the Derringer pistol she carried, and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at him, thereby saving her life. In another instant she had made an effort, and assisted by the nurse, who was lying on the top, had scrambled over the wall, and I knew that she was, comparatively speaking, safe.",be need signal side kraal break wave line fire join manage snap shot knock jump top end kraal ring awful yell rejoice recognize pierce note rise clear shrill din second follow scene see universal howl terror fury brawny crowd savage kraal spring foot many fall direct hail lead move yard moment stand undecided hear cry curse rise top end kraal bewilder storm bullet impulse rush thorn stop entrance go keep pour fire terrible effect thicken mob load empty repeater shot contain begin slip more bethough little look see white donkey lie kick knock bullet spear thrust be living black nurse foot spear cut rope bind foot next second run wall kraal begin climb example little girl follow stiff cramped go go fly kraal catch sight rush kill first fellow come poor little girl desperate effort climb wall fall kraal flash great spear do bullet rifle find home holder rib go shot rabbit other man have cartridge magazine scramble foot face second man advance raise spear turn head feel sick death bear see stab glance surprise see spear lie ground man staggering hand head see puff smoke proceed man fall remember pistol carry see fire barrel save life instant make effort assist nurse lie top scramble wall know speak safe 
27,"All this takes time to tell, but I do not suppose that it took more than fifteen seconds to enact. I soon got the magazine of the repeater filled again with cartridges, and once more opened fire, not on the seething black mass which was gathering at the end of the kraal, but on fugitives who bethought them to climb the wall. I picked off several of these men, moving down towards the end of the kraal as I did so, and arriving at the corner, or rather the bend of the oval, in time to see, and by means of my rifle to assist in, the mighty struggle that took place there.",take time tell suppose take more second enact get magazine repeater fill cartridge open fire seethe black mass gather end kraal fugitive bethough climb wall pick several man move end kraal do arrive corner bend oval time see means rifle assist mighty struggle take place 
28,"By this time some two hundred Masai--allowing that we had up to the present accounted for fifty--had gathered together in front of the thorn-stopped entrance, driven thither by the spears of Good’s men, whom they doubtless supposed were a large force instead of being but ten strong. For some reason it never occurred to them to try and rush the wall, which they could have scrambled over with comparative ease; they all made for the fence, which was really a strongly interwoven fortification. With a bound the first warrior went at it, and even before he touched the ground on the other side I saw Sir Henry’s great axe swing up and fall with awful force upon his feather head-piece, and he sank into the middle of the thorns. Then with a yell and a crash they began to break through as they might, and ever as they came the great axe swung and Inkosi-kaas flashed and they fell dead one by one, each man thus helping to build up a barrier against his fellows. Those who escaped the axes of the pair fell at the hands of the Askari and the two Mission Kaffirs, and those who passed scatheless from them were brought low by my own and Mackenzie’s fire.",time allow have present account gather front thorn stop entrance drive spear man suppose large force strong reason occur try rush wall scramble comparative ease make fence interwoven fortification bind first warrior go touch ground other side see great axe swing fall awful force feather head piece sink middle thorn yell crash begin break come great axe swing flash fall dead man help build barrier fellow escape axe pair fall hand pass bring own fire 
29,"Faster and more furious grew the fighting. Single Masai would spring upon the dead bodies of their comrades, and engage one or other of the axemen with their long spears; but, thanks chiefly to the mail shirts, the result was always the same. Presently there was a great swing of the axe, a crashing sound, and another dead Masai. That is, if the man was engaged with Sir Henry. If it was Umslopogaas that he fought with the result indeed would be the same, but it would be differently attained. It was but rarely that the Zulu used the crashing double-handed stroke; on the contrary, he did little more than tap continually at his adversary’s head, pecking at it with the pole-axe end of the axe as a woodpecker {Endnote 7} pecks at rotten wood. Presently a peck would go home, and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole in his forehead or skull, exactly similar to that which a cheese-scoop makes in a cheese. He never used the broad blade of the axe except when hard pressed, or when striking at a shield. He told me afterwards that he did not consider it sportsmanlike.",fast furious grow fighting single spring dead body comrade engage other axemen long spear thanks mail shirt result same be great swing axe crash sound dead man engage fight result same attain use crash double handed stroke contrary do little more tap adversary head peck pole axe end axe woodpecker } peck rotten wood peck go enemy drop neat little circular hole forehead skull similar cheese scoop make cheese use broad blade axe press strike shield tell consider sportsmanlike 
30,"Good and his men were quite close by now, and our people had to cease firing into the mass for fear of killing some of them (as it was, one of them was slain in this way). Mad and desperate with fear, the Masai by a frantic effort burst through the thorn fence and piled-up dead, and, sweeping Curtis, Umslopogaas, and the other three before them, into the open. And now it was that we began to lose men fast. Down went our poor Askari who was armed with the axe, a great spear standing out a foot behind his back; and before long the two spearsmen who had stood with him went down too, dying fighting like tigers; and others of our party shared their fate. For a moment I feared the fight was lost--certainly it trembled in the balance. I shouted to my men to cast down their rifles, and to take spears and throw themselves into the melee. They obeyed, their blood being now thoroughly up, and Mr Mackenzie’s people followed their example.",good man close person have cease fire mass fear kill slain way mad desperate fear frantic effort burst thorn fence pile dead sweep other open begin lose man go poor armed axe great spear stand foot back spearsmen stand go die fight tiger other party share fate moment fear fight lose tremble balance shout man cast rifle take spear throw melee obey blood person follow example 
31,"This move had a momentary good result, but still the fight hung in the balance.",move have momentary good result fight hang balance 
32,"Our people fought magnificently, hurling themselves upon the dark mass of Elmoran, hewing, thrusting, slaying, and being slain. And ever above the din rose Good’s awful yell of encouragement as he plunged to wherever the fight was thickest; and ever, with an almost machine-like regularity, the two axes rose and fell, carrying death and disablement at every stroke. But I could see that the strain was beginning to tell upon Sir Henry, who was bleeding from several flesh wounds: his breath was coming in gasps, and the veins stood out on his forehead like blue and knotted cords. Even Umslopogaas, man of iron that he was, was hard pressed. I noticed that he had given up ‘woodpecking’, and was now using the broad blade of Inkosi-kaas, ‘browning’ his enemy wherever he could hit him, instead of drilling scientific holes in his head. I myself did not go into the melee, but hovered outside like the swift ‘back’ in a football scrimmage, putting a bullet through a Masai whenever I got a chance. I was more use so. I fired forty-nine cartridges that morning, and I did not miss many shots.",person fight hurl dark mass hew thrust slay slain din rise awful yell encouragement plunge fight thickest machine like regularity axe rise fall carry death disablement stroke see strain begin tell bleed several flesh wound breath come gasp vein stand forehead blue knotted cord man iron hard press notice give woodpecking use broad blade brown enemy hit drill scientific hole head go melee hover swift back football scrimmage put bullet get chance use fire cartridge morning miss many shot 
33,"Presently, do as we would, the beam of the balance began to rise against us. We had not more than fifteen or sixteen effectives left now, and the Masai had at least fifty. Of course if they had kept their heads, and shaken themselves together, they could soon have made an end of the matter; but that is just what they did not do, not having yet recovered from their start, and some of them having actually fled from their sleeping-places without their weapons. Still by now many individuals were fighting with their normal courage and discretion, and this alone was sufficient to defeat us. To make matters worse just then, when Mackenzie’s rifle was empty, a brawny savage armed with a ‘sime’, or sword, made a rush for him. The clergyman flung down his gun, and drawing his huge carver from his elastic belt (his revolver had dropped out in the fight), they closed in desperate struggle. Presently, locked in a close embrace, missionary and Masai rolled on the ground behind the wall, and for some time I, being amply occupied with my own affairs, and in keeping my skin from being pricked, remained in ignorance of his fate or how the duel had ended.",do beam balance begin rise have more effective leave have least course keep head shake make end matter do recover start flead sleeping place weapon many individual fight normal courage discretion sufficient defeat make matter bad rifle empty brawny savage armed sime sword make rush clergyman flung gun draw huge carver elastic belt revolver drop fight close desperate struggle lock close embrace missionary roll ground wall time occupy own affair keep skin prick remain ignorance fate duel end 
34,"To and fro surged the fight, slowly turning round like the vortex of a human whirlpool, and the matter began to look very bad for us. Just then, however, a fortunate thing happened. Umslopogaas, either by accident or design, broke out of the ring and engaged a warrior at some few paces from it. As he did so, another man ran up and struck him with all his force between his shoulders with his great spear, which, falling on the tough steel shirt, failed to pierce it and rebounded. For a moment the man stared aghast--protective armour being unknown among these tribes--and then he yelled out at the top of his voice--",for surge fight turn vortex human whirlpool matter begin look bad fortunate thing happen accident design break ring engage warrior few pace do man run strike force shoulder great spear fall tough steel shirt fail pierce rebound moment man stare aghast protective armour unknown tribe yell top voice 
35,"‘_They are devils--bewitched, bewitched!_’ And seized by a sudden panic, he threw down his spear, and began to fly. I cut short his career with a bullet, and Umslopogaas brained his man, and then the panic spread to the others.",devil bewitch bewitch seize sudden panic throw spear begin fly cut short career bullet brain man panic spread other

37,"On the last scene of that dreadful fight I need not dwell. It was a slaughter great and grim, in which no quarter was asked or given. One incident, however, is worth detailing. Just as I was hoping that it was all done with, suddenly from under a heap of slain where he had been hiding, an unwounded warrior sprang up, and, clearing the piles of dying dead like an antelope, sped like the wind up the kraal towards the spot where I was standing at the moment. But he was not alone, for Umslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallow-like motion for which he was noted, and as they neared me I recognized in the Masai the herald of the previous night. Finding that, run as he would, his pursuer was gaining on him, the man halted and turned round to give battle. Umslopogaas also pulled up.",last scene dreadful fight dwell slaughter great grim quarter ask give incident worth detail hope do heap slain hide unwounded warrior spring clear pile die dead antelope spe wind kraal spot stand moment alone come glide track peculiar swallow motion note near recognize herald previous night find run pursuer gain man halt turn give battle pull 
38,"‘Ah, ah,’ he cried, in mockery, to the Elmoran, ‘it is thou whom I talked with last night--the Lygonani! the Herald! the capturer of little girls--he who would kill a little girl! And thou didst hope to stand man to man and face to face with Umslopogaas, an Induna of the tribe of the Maquilisini, of the people of the Amazulu? Behold, thy prayer is granted!

39,"The Masai ground his teeth with fury, and charged at the Zulu with his spear. As he came, Umslopogaas deftly stepped aside, and swinging Inkosi-kaas high above his head with both hands, brought the broad blade down with such fearful force from behind upon the Masai’s shoulder just where the neck is set into the frame, that its razor edge shore right through bone and flesh and muscle, almost severing the head and one arm from the body.",ground tooth fury charge spear come step swing high head hand bring broad blade such fearful force shoulder neck set frame razor edge shore bone flesh muscle sever head arm body
