1,CHAPTER 24. THE RESULT OF THE EXAMINATION.,result examination 
2,The adventures of the morning did not certainly tend to make the Fifth think better of Oliver Greenfield.,adventure morning tend make fifth think good 
3,"Had he appeared before them humble and penitent, there were some who even then might have tried to forgive him and forget what was done.  But instead of that he was evidently determined to brazen the thing out, and had begun by snubbing the very fellows whom he had so deeply injured.",appear humble penitent be try forgive forget do determined brazen thing begin snubb very fellow injure 
4,"Wraysford felt specially hurt.  It had cost him a good deal to put on a friendly air and speak as if nothing had happened; and to find himself scorned for his pains and actually avoided by the friend who had wronged him was too much.  But even that would not have been so bad, had not Oliver immediately gone and made up to Simon before all the class.",feel hurt cost good deal put friendly air speak happen find scorn pain avoid friend wrong much bad go make class 
5,Wraysford did not remain to join in the chorus of indignation in which the others indulged after morning school was over.  He left them and strolled out dismally into the playground.,remain join chorus indignation other indulge morning school leave stroll playground 
6,"He must do something!  He must know one way or the other what to think of Oliver.  Even now he would gladly believe that it was all a dream, and that nothing had come between him and his old friend.  But the more he pondered it the more convinced he became it was anything but a dream.",do know way other think believe dream come old friend more ponder convinced become dream 
7,"He wandered unconsciously beyond the playground towards the woods on the side of the Shar, where he and Oliver had walked so often in the old days.",wander playground wood side walk old day 
8,The old days!  It was but yesterday that they had last walked there. Yet what an age ago it seemed! and how impossible that the old days should ever come back again.,old day yesterday walk age seem impossible old day come 
9,He had not got far into the wood when he heard what seemed to him familiar footsteps ahead of him.  Yesterday he would have shouted and whistled and called on the fellow to hold hard.  But now he had no such inclination.  His impulse was to turn round and go back.,get wood hear seem familiar footstep yesterday shout whistle call fellow hold have such inclination impulse turn go 
10,"""And yet,"" thought he, ""why should _I go_ back?  If it is Oliver, what have _I_ to feel ashamed of?""",think ge__ have feel ashamed 
11,"And so he advanced.  The boy in front of him was walking slowly, and Wraysford soon came in view of him.  As he expected, it was Oliver.",advance boy front walk come view expect 
12,"At the sight of his old friend, wandering here solitary and listless, all Wraysford's old affection came suddenly back.  At least he would make one more effort.  So he quickened his pace.  Oliver turned and saw him coming.  But he did not wait.  He walked on slowly as before, apparently indifferent to the approach of anybody.",sight old friend wonder solitary listless old affection come least make more effort quicken pace turn see come wait walk indifferent approach 
13,This was a damper certainly to Wraysford.  At least Oliver might have guessed why his friend was coming after him.,damper least guess friend come 
14,"It was desperately hard to know how to begin a conversation.  Oliver trudged on, sullen and silent, in anything but an encouraging manner. Still, Wraysford, now his mind was made up, was not to be put from his purpose.",hard know begin conversation trudge sullen silent encourage manner mind make put purpose 
15,"""Noll, old man,"" he began, in as much of his old tone and manner as he could assume.",old man begin much old tone manner assume 
16,"""Well?"" said Oliver, not looking up.",say look 
17,"""Aren't we to be friends still?""",friend 
18,"The question cost the speaker a hard effort, and evidently went home. Oliver stopped short in his walk, and looking full in his old friend's face, said, ""Why do you ask?""",question cost speaker hard effort go stop short walk look full old friend face say ask 
19,"""Because I'm afraid we are not friends at this moment.""",afraid friend moment 
20,"""And whose fault is that?"" said Oliver, scornfully.",fault say 
21,"The question stung Wraysford as much as it amazed him.  Was he, then, of all the fellows in the school, to have an explanation thus demanded of him from one who had done him the most grievous personal wrong one schoolboy well could do to another?",question st amaze fellow school have explanation demand do grievous personal wrong schoolboy do 
22,"His face flushed as he replied slowly, ""Your fault, Greenfield; how can you ask?""",face flush reply fault ask 
23,"Oliver gave a short laugh very like contempt, and then turned suddenly on his heel, leaving Wraysford smarting with indignation, and finally convinced that between his old friend and himself there was a gulf which now it would be hard indeed to bridge over.",give short laugh contempt turn heel leave smart indignation convince old friend be gulf hard bridge 
24,He returned moodily to the school.  Stephen was busy in his study getting tea.,return school busy study get tea 
25,"""Hullo, Wray,"" he shouted, as the elder boy entered; ""don't you wish it was this time to-morrow?  I do, I'm mad to hear the result!""",shout elder boy enter wish time mad hear result 
26,"""Are you?"" said Wraysford.",say 
27,"""Yes, and so are you, you old humbug.  Noll says he thinks he did pretty well, and that you answered well too.  I say, what a joke if it's a dead heat, and you both get bracketed first.""",old humbug say think do answer say joke dead heat bracket 
28,"""Cut away now,"" said Wraysford, as coolly as he could, ""and don't make such a row.""",cut say make row 
29,"There was something unusual in his tone which surprised the small boy. He put it down, however, to worry about the examination, and quietly withdrew as commanded.",be unusual tone surprise small boy put worry examination withdraw command 
30,"The next day came at last.  Two days ago, in the Fifth Form, at any rate, it would have been uphill work for any master to attempt to conduct morning class in the face of all the eagerness and enthusiasm with which the result of the examinations would have been looked-for. Now, however, there was all the suspense, indeed, but it was the suspense of dread rather than triumph.",next day come last day fifth form rate uphill work master attempt conduct morning class face eagerness enthusiasm result examination look be suspense suspense dread triumph 
31,"""Never mind,"" said Ricketts to Pembury, after the two had been talking over the affair for the twentieth time.  ""Never mind; and there's just this, Tony, if Wray is only second, it will be a splendid win for the Fifth all the same.""",mind say talk affair twentieth time mind be second splendid win fifth same 
32,"""I see nothing splendid in the whole concern,"" said Pembury.  And that was the general feeling.",see splendid whole concern say general feeling 
33,"Oliver entered and took his accustomed seat in silence.  No one spoke to him, many moved away from him, and nearly all favoured him with a long and unfriendly stare.",enter take accustom seat silence speak many move favour long unfriendly stare 
34,"All these things he took unmoved.  He sat coolly waiting for class to begin, and when it did begin, any one would have supposed he was the only comfortable and easy-minded fellow in the room.  The lesson dragged on languidly that morning.  Most of the boys seemed to regard it as something inflicted on them to pass the time rather than as a serious effort of instruction.  The clock crawled slowly on from ten to eleven, and from eleven to half-past, and every one was glad when at last Mr Jellicott closed his book.  Then followed an interval of suspense.  The Doctor was due with the results, and was even now announcing them in the Sixth.  What ages it seemed before his footsteps sounded in the passage outside the Fifth!",thing take unmoved sit wait class begin begin one suppose comfortable easy minded fellow room lesson drag morning most boy seem regard inflict pass time serious effort instruction clock crawl half past one glad last close book follow interval suspense due result announce age seem footstep sound passage fifth 
35,"At last he entered, and a hush fell over the class.  One or two glanced quickly up, as though they hoped to read their fate in the head master's face.  Others waited, too anxious to stir or look up.  Others groaned inwardly with a sort of prophetic foresight of what was to come.",last enter hush fall class glance hope read fate head master face other wait anxious stir look other groan sort prophetic foresight come 
36,The Doctor walked up to the desk and unfolded his paper.,walk desk unfold paper 
37,"Wraysford looked furtively across the room to where his old friend sat. There was a flush in Oliver's face as he followed the Doctor with his eyes; he was breathing hard, Wraysford could see, and the corners of his mouth were working with more than ordinary nervousness.",look room old friend sit be flush face follow eye breathe see corner mouth work more ordinary nervousness 
38,"""Alas!"" thought Wraysford, ""I don't envy him his thoughts!""",think envy thought 
39,The Doctor began to speak.,begin speak 
40,"""The following are the results of the various examinations held on Monday.  English Literature--maximum number of marks 100. 1st, Bullinger, 72 marks; 2nd, West, 68; 3rd, Maybury, 51; 4th, Simon, 23. I'm afraid, Simon, you were a little too venturesome entering for an examination like this.  Your paper was a very poor performance.""",follow result various examination hold english maximum number mark 1st mark 3rd 4th afraid little venturesome enter examination paper poor performance 
41,Simon groaned and gulped down his astonishment.,groan gulp astonishment 
42,"""I say,"" whispered he to Oliver, who sat in front of him, ""I know it's a mistake: you know I wrote five cantos about the Shar--good too.  He's lost that.  I say, had I better tell him?""",say whisper sit front know mistake know write canto good lose say tell 
43,"Oliver vouchsafing no reply, the unfortunate poet merely replied to the head master's remarks, ""Yes, sir,"" and then subsided, more convinced than ever that Saint Dominic's was not worthy of him.",vouchsafe reply unfortunate poet reply head master remark sir subside convinced worthy 
44,"""The Mathematical Medal--maximum number of marks 80. 1st, Heath, 65; 2nd, Price, 54; 3rd, Roberts, 53.  Heath's answers, I may say, were very good, and the examiners have specially commended him.""",mathematical maximum number mark 1st 3rd answer say good examiner commend 
45,"Heath being a Sixth Form man, this information was absolutely without interest to the Fifth, who wondered why the Doctor should put himself out of the way to announce it.",sixth form man information interest fifth wonder put way announce 
46,"""The Nightingale Scholarship.""",
47,"Ah, now!  There was a quick stir, and then a deeper silence than ever as the Doctor slowly read out, ""The maximum number of marks possible, 120. First, Greenfield, Fifth Form, 112 marks.  And I must say I and the examiners are astonished as well as highly gratified with this really brilliant performance.  Greenfield, I congratulate you as well as your class-fellows on your success.  It does you the very greatest credit!""",be quick stir deep silence read maximum number mark possible fifth form mark say examiner astonished gratified brilliant performance congratulate class fellow success great credit 
48,"A dead silence followed this eulogium.  Those who watched Oliver saw his face first glow, then turn pale, as the Doctor spoke.  He kept his eyes steadily fixed on the paper in the head master's hand, as if waiting for what was to follow.",dead silence follow eulogium watch see face first glow turn pale speak keep eye fix paper head master hand wait follow 
49,"The Doctor went on, ""Second, Wraysford, Fifth Form, 97 marks, also a creditable performance.""",go second fifth mark creditable performance 
50,"One or two near Wraysford clapped him warmly on the back, and throughout the class generally there was a show of satisfaction at this result, in strange contrast with the manner in which the announcement of Oliver's success had been received.",clapp back class show satisfaction result strange contrast manner announcement success receive 
51,"Still, every one was too eager to hear the third and final announcement to disturb the proceedings by any demonstration just now.",one eager hear third final announcement disturb proceedings demonstration 
52,"""Loman, Sixth Form--"" and here the Doctor paused, and knitted his brows.",sixth pause knite brow 
53,"""Loman, Sixth Form, 70 marks!""",sixth mark 
54,"This finally brought down the house.  Scarcely was the Doctor's back turned, when a general clamour rose on every hand.  He, good man, set it down to applause of the winners, but every one else knew it meant triumph over the vanquished.",bring house back turn general clamour rise hand good man set applause winner one know mean triumph vanquish 
55,"""Bravo, Wray! old man.  Hurrah for the Fifth!"" shouted Bullinger.",old man fifth shout

58,"""I have not won,"" said Wraysford, drily, and evidently not liking these marked congratulations; ""I'm second.""",win say drily like mark congratulation second 
59,"""So you are, I quite forgot,"" said Ricketts: then turning to Oliver, he added, mockingly, ""Allow me to congratulate you, Greenfield, on your really brilliant success. 112 marks out of 120!  You could hardly have done better if you had seen the paper a day or two before the exam! Your class, I assure you, are very proud of you.""",forget say turn add allow congratulate brilliant success mark do good see paper day exam class assure proud 
60,"A general sneer of contempt followed this speech, in the midst of which Oliver, after darting one angry glance at the speaker, deliberately quitted the room.",general sneer contempt follow speech midst dart angry glance speaker quit room 
61,"This proceeding greatly irritated the Fifth, who had hoped at least to make their class-fellow smart while they had the opportunity.  They greeted his departure now with a general chorus of hissing, and revenged themselves in his absence by making the most of Wraysford.",proceeding irritate fifth hope least make class fellow smart have opportunity greet departure general chorus hissing revenge absence make most

77,"""And I envy his prospects in the Fifth still less,"" said Ricketts.",envy prospect fifth less say 
78,"""If you take my advice,"" said Pembury, ""you'll leave him pretty much to himself.  Greenfield is a sort of fellow it's not easy to score off; and some of you would only make fools of yourselves if you tried to do it.""",take advice say leave sort fellow easy score make fool try do 
79,"Wraysford had stood by during this conversation, torn by conflicting emotions.  He was undoubtedly bitterly disappointed to have missed the scholarship; but that was as nothing to the knowledge that it was his friend, his own familiar friend, who had turned against him and thus grievously wronged him.  Yet with all his sense of injury he could hardly stand by and listen to all the bitter talk about Oliver in his absence without a sense of shame.  Two days ago he would have flared up at the first word, and given the rash speaker something to remember. Now it was his misery to stand by and hear his old chum abused and despised, and to feel that he deserved every word that was spoken of him!",stand conversation tear conflict emotion disappointed miss scholarship knowledge friend own familiar friend turn wrong sense injury stand listen bitter talk absence sense shame day flare first word give rash speaker remember misery stand hear old chum abuse despise feel deserve word speak

81,"But he could not, and so left the room as soon as it was possible to escape, and retired disconsolately to his own study.",leave room possible escape retire own study 
82,"As for the Fifth, Pembury's advice prevailed with them.  There were a few who were still disposed to take their revenge on Oliver in a more marked manner than by merely cutting him; but a dread of the tongue of the editor of the _Dominican_, as well as a conviction of the uselessness of such procedure, constrained them to give way and fall in with the general resolution.",fifth advice prevail be few dispose take revenge mark manner cut dread tongue editor conviction uselessness such procedure constrain give way fall general resolution 
83,"One boy only was intractable.  That was Simon.  It was not in the poet's nature to agree to cut anybody.  When the class dispersed he took it into his gifted head to march direct to Oliver's study.  Oliver was there, writing a letter.",boy intractable poet nature agree cut class disperse take gift head march direct study write letter 
84,"""Oh, I say, you know,"" began Simon, nervously, but smiling most affably, ""all the fellows are going to cut you, you know, Greenfield.  About that paper, you know, the time I met you coming out of the Doctor's study. But _I_ won't cut you, you know.  We'll hush it all up, you know, Greenfield; upon my word we will.
