1,CHAPTER XIX. THE FIGHT AT THE FORD,fight 
2," BY the early September sunrise the thicket beneath the pass was sheltering the twenty well-appointed reiters of Adlerstein, each standing, holding his horse by the bridle, ready to mount at the instant. In their rear were the serfs and artisans, some with axes, scythes, or ploughshares, a few with cross-bows, and Jobst and his sons with the long blackened poles used for stirring their charcoal fires.  In advance were Master Moritz and the two barons, the former in a stout plain steel helmet, cuirass, and gauntlets, a sword, and those new-fashioned weapons, pistols; the latter in full knightly armour, exactly alike, from the gilt-spurred heel to the eagle-crested helm, and often moving restlessly forward to watch for the enemy, though taking care not to be betrayed by the glitter of their mail.  So long did they wait that there was even a doubt whether it might not have been a false alarm; the boy was vituperated, and it was proposed to despatch a spy to see whether anything were doing at Schlangenwald.",early sunrise thicket pass shelter appoint reiter stand hold horse bridle ready mount instant rear serf artisan axe scythe ploughshare few cross-bow son long blacken pole use stir charcoal fire advance baron former stout plain steel helmet cuirass gauntlet sword new fashioned weapon pistol latter full knightly armour alike gilt spur heel eagle crest helm move watch enemy take care betray glitter mail wait be doubt false alarm boy vituperate propose despatch spy see do 
3,"At length a rustling and rushing were heard; then a clank of armour. Ebbo vaulted into the saddle, and gave the word to mount; Schleiermacher, who always fought on foot, stepped up to him.  “Keep back your men, Herr Freiherr.  Let his design be manifest.  We must not be said to have fallen on him on his way to the muster.”",length rustling rush hear clank armour vault saddle give word mount fight foot step keep man let design manifest say fall way muster 
4,"“It would be but as he served my father!” muttered Ebbo, forced, however, to restrain himself, though with boiling blood, as the tramp of horses shook the ground, and bright armour became visible on the further side of the stream.",serve father mutter force restrain boil blood tramp horse shake ground bright armour become visible further side stream 
5,"For the first time, the brothers beheld the foe of their line.  He was seated on a clumsy black horse, and sheathed in full armour, and was apparently a large heavy man, whose powerful proportions were becoming unwieldy as he advanced in life.  The dragon on his crest and shield would have made him known to the twins, even without the deadly curse that passed the Schneiderlein’s lips at the sight.  As the armed troop, out-numbering the Adlersteiners by about a dozen, and followed by a rabble with straw and pine brands, came forth on the meadow, the count halted and appeared to be giving orders.",first time brother beheld foe line seat clumsy black horse sheath full armour large heavy man powerful proportion become unwieldy advance life dragon crest shield make know twin deadly curse pass lip sight armed troop number follow rabble straw pine brand come meadow count halt appear give order 
6,“The ruffian!  He is calling them on!  Now—” began Ebbo.,ruffian call begin 
7,"“Nay, there is no sign yet that he is not peacefully on his journey to the camp,” responded Moritz; and, chafing with impatient fury, the knight waited while Schlangenwald rode towards the old channel of the Braunwasser, and there, drawing his rein, and sitting like a statue in his stirrups, he could hear him shout: “The lazy dogs are not astir yet. We will give them a réveille.  Forward with your brands!”",be sign journey camp respond chaf impatient fury knight wait ride old channel draw rein sit statue stirrup hear shout lazy dog astir give réveille brand

9,“Who troubles the workmen on my land?” shouted Ebbo.,trouble workmen land shout 
10,"“Who you may be I care not,” replied the count, “but when I find strangers unlicensed on my lands, I burn down their huts.  On, fellows!”",care reply count find stranger unlicensed land burn hut fellow 
11,"“Back, fellows!” called Ebbo.  “Whoso touches a stick on Adlerstein ground shall suffer.”",fellow call touch stick ground suffer 
12,"“So!” said the count, “this is the burgher-bred, burgher-fed varlet, that calls himself of Adlerstein!  Boy, thou had best be warned.  Wert thou true-blooded, it were worth my while to maintain my rights against thee. Craven as thou art, not even with spirit to accept my feud, I would fain not have the trouble of sweeping thee from my path.”",say count burgher breed burgher feed varlet call warn true blooded worth while maintain right art spirit accept feud have trouble sweep path

14,"“Thou wilt have it then,” said the count, taking his heavy lance from his squire, closing his visor, and wheeling back his horse, so as to give space for his career.",have say count take heavy lance squire close visor wheel horse give space career 
15,"Ebbo did the like, while Friedel on one side, and Hierom von Schlangenwald on the other, kept their men in array, awaiting the issue of the strife between their leaders—the fire of seventeen against the force of fifty-six.",do like side other keep man array await issue strife leader fire force 
16,"They closed in full shock, with shivered lances and rearing, pawing horses, but without damage to either.  Each drew his sword, and they were pressing together, when Heinz, seeing a Schlangenwalder aiming with his cross-bow, rode at him furiously, and the mêlée became general; shots were fired, not only from cross-bows, but from arquebuses, and in the throng Friedel lost sight of the main combat between his brother and the count.",close full shock shiver lance rearing paw horse damage draw sword press see aim cross-bow ride mêlée become general shot fire cross-bow arquebuse throng lose sight main combat brother count 
17,"Suddenly however there was a crash, as of falling men and horses, with a shout of victory strangely mingled with a cry of agony, and both sides became aware that their leaders had fallen.  Each party rushed to its fallen head.  Friedel beheld Ebbo under his struggling horse, and an enemy dashing at his throat, and, flying to the rescue, he rode down the assailant, striking him with his sword; and, with the instinct of driving the foe as far as possible from his brother, he struck with a sort of frenzy, shouting fiercely to his men, and leaping over the dry bed of the river, rushing onward with an intoxication of ardour that would have seemed foreign to his gentle nature, but for the impetuous desire to protect his brother.  Their leaders down, the enemy had no one to rally them, and, in spite of their superiority in number, gave way in confusion before the furious onset of Adlerstein.  So soon, however, as Friedel perceived that he had forced the enemy far back from the scene of conflict, his anxiety for his brother returned, and, leaving the retainers to continue the pursuit, he turned his horse.  There, on the green meadow, lay on the one hand Ebbo’s cream-coloured charger, with his master under him, on the other the large figure of the count; and several other prostrate forms likewise struggled on the sand and pebbles of the strand, or on the turf.",be crash fall man horse shout victory mingle cry agony side become aware leader fall party rush fall head beheld struggle horse enemy dash throat fly rescue ride assailant strike sword instinct drive foe possible brother strike sort frenzy shouting man leap dry bed river rush intoxication ardour seem foreign gentle nature impetuous desire protect brother leader enemy have rally spite superiority number give way confusion furious onset perceive force enemy scene conflict anxiety brother return leave retainer continue pursuit turn horse green meadow lay hand cream coloured charge master other large figure count several other prostrate form struggle sand pebble strand turf 
18,"“Ay,” said the architect, who had turned with Friedel, “’twas a gallant feat, Sir Friedel, and I trust there is no great harm done.  Were it the mere dint of the count’s sword, your brother will be little the worse.”",say architect turn gallant feat trust be great harm do mere dint count sword brother little bad 
19,"“Ebbo!  Ebbo mine, look up!” cried Friedel, leaping from his horse, and unclasping his brother’s helmet.",look cry leap horse unclasp brother helmet 
20,“Friedel!” groaned a half-suffocated voice.  “O take away the horse.”,groan half suffocate voice take horse 
21,"One or two of the artisans were at hand, and with their help the dying steed was disengaged from the rider, who could not restrain his moans, though Friedel held him in his arms, and endeavoured to move him as gently as possible.  It was then seen that the deep gash from the count’s sword in the chest was not the most serious injury, but that an arquebus ball had pierced his thigh, before burying itself in the body of his horse; and that the limb had been further crushed and wrenched by the animal’s struggles.  He was nearly unconscious, and gasped with anguish, but, after Moritz had bathed his face and moistened his lips, as he lay in his brother’s arms, he looked up with clearer eyes, and said: “Have I slain him?  It was the shot, not he, that sent me down.  Lives he? See—thou, Friedel—thou.  Make him yield.”",artisan hand help die steed disengage rider restrain moan hold arm endeavour move possible see deep gash count sword chest serious injury arquebus ball pierce thigh bury body horse limb crush wrench animal struggle unconscious gasp anguish bath face moisten lip lay brother arm look clear eye say slain shot send life see make yield 
22,"Transferring Ebbo to the arms of Schleiermacher, Friedel obeyed, and stepped towards the fallen foe.  The wrongs of Adlerstein were indeed avenged, for the blood was welling fast from a deep thrust above the collar-bone, and the failing, feeble hand was wandering uncertainly among the clasps of the gorget.",transferr arm obey step fall foe wrong avenge blood well deep thrust collar bone fail feeble hand wonder clasp gorget 
23,"“Let me aid,” said Friedel, kneeling down, and in his pity for the dying man omitting the summons to yield, he threw back the helmet, and beheld a grizzled head and stern hard features, so embrowned by weather and inflamed by intemperance, that even approaching death failed to blanch them.  A scowl of malignant hate was in the eyes, and there was a thrill of angry wonder as they fell on the lad’s face.  “Thou again,—thou whelp! I thought at least I had made an end of thee,” he muttered, unheard by Friedel, who, intent on the thought that had recurred to him with greater vividness than ever, was again filling Ebbo’s helmet with water.  He refreshed the dying man’s face with it, held it to his lips, and said: “Herr Graf, variance and strife are ended now.  For heaven’s sake, say where I may find my father!”",let aid say kneel pity die man omit summons yield throw helmet beheld grizzled head stern hard feature embrown weather inflamed intemperance approach death fail blanch scowl malignant hate eye be thrill angry wonder fall lad face whelp think least make end mutter unheard intent thought recurr great vividness fill helmet water refresh die man face hold lip say variance strife end heaven sake say find father

25,"“I would bless you for ever, could I but free him.”",bless free 
26,"“Know then,” said the count, speaking very slowly, and still holding the young knight’s gaze with a sort of intent fascination, by the stony glare of his light gray eyes, “know that thy villain father is a Turkish slave, unless he be—as I hope—where his mongrel son may find him.”",know say count speak hold young knight gaze sort intent fascination stony glare light gray eye know villain father turkish slave hope mongrel son find 
27,"Therewith came a flash, a report; Friedel leaped back, staggered, fell; Ebbo started to a sitting posture, with horrified eyes, and a loud shriek, calling on his brother; Moritz sprang to his feet, shouting, “Shame! treason!”",come flash report leap stagger fall start sit posture horrify eye loud shriek call brother spring foot shouting shame treason 
28,"“I call you to witness that I had not yielded,” said the count.  “There’s an end of the brood!” and with a grim smile, he straightened his limbs, and closed his eyes as a dead man, ere the indignant artisans fell on him in savage vengeance.",call witness yield say count be end brood grim smile straighten limb close eye dead man indignant artisan fall savage vengeance 
29,"All this had passed like a flash of lightning, and Friedel had almost at the instant of his fall flung himself towards his brother, and raising himself on one hand, with the other clasped Ebbo’s, saying, “Fear not; it is nothing,” and he was bending to take Ebbo’s head again on his knee, when a gush of dark blood, from his left side, caused Moritz to exclaim, “Ah!  Sir Friedel, the traitor did his work!  That is no slight hurt.”",pass flash lightning instant fall flung brother raise hand other clasp say fear bending take head knee gush dark blood left side cause exclaim traitor do work slight hurt 
30,"“Where?  How?  The ruffian!” cried Ebbo, supporting himself on his elbow, so as to see his brother, who rather dreamily put his hand to his side, and, looking at the fresh blood that immediately dyed it, said, “I do not feel it.  This is more numb dulness than pain.”",ruffian cry support elbow see brother put hand side look fresh blood dyed say feel numb dulness pain 
31,"“A bad sign that,” said Moritz, apart to one of the workmen, with whom he held counsel how to carry back to the castle the two young knights, who remained on the bank, Ebbo partly extended on the ground, partly supported on the knee and arm of Friedel, who sat with his head drooping over him, their looks fixed on one another, as if conscious of nothing else on earth.",bad sign say workmen hold counsel carry castle young knight remain bank extend ground support knee arm sit head droop look fix conscious else earth 
32,"“Herr Freiherr,” said Moritz, presently, “have you breath to wind your bugle to call the men back from the pursuit?”",say have breath wind bugle call man pursuit 
33,"Ebbo essayed, but was too faint, and Friedel, rousing himself from the stupor, took the horn from him, and made the mountain echoes ring again, but at the expense of a great effusion of blood.",essay faint rouse stupor take horn make mountain echo ring expense great effusion blood 
34,"By this time, however, Heinz was riding back, and a moment his exultation changed to rage and despair, when he saw the condition of his young lords.  Master Schleiermacher proposed to lay them on some of the planks prepared for the building, and carry them up the new road.",time ride moment exultation change rage despair see condition young lord propose lay plank prepare building carry new road 
35,"“Methinks,” said Friedel, “that I could ride if I were lifted on horseback, and thus would our mother be less shocked.”",methink say ride lift horseback mother shocked 
36,"“Well thought,” said Ebbo.  “Go on and cheer her.  Show her thou canst keep the saddle, however it may be with me,” he added, with a groan of anguish.",think say go cheer show keep saddle add groan anguish 
37,"Friedel made the sign of the cross over him.  “The holy cross keep us and her, Ebbo,” he said, as he bent to assist in laying his brother on the boards, where a mantle had been spread; then kissed his brow, saying, “We shall be together again soon.”",make sign cross holy cross keep say bend assist lay brother board mantle spread kiss brow say 
38,"Ebbo was lifted on the shoulders of his bearers, and Friedel strove to rise, with the aid of Heinz, but sank back, unable to use his limbs; and Schleiermacher was the more concerned.  “It goes so with the backbone,” he said.  “Sir Friedmund, you had best be carried.”",lift shoulder bearer strive rise aid sink unable use limb concerned go backbone say have good carry 
39,"“Nay, for my mother’s sake!  And I would fain be on my good steed’s back once again!” he entreated.  And when with much difficulty he had been lifted to the back of his cream-colour, who stood as gently and patiently as if he understood the exigency of the moment, he sat upright, and waved his hand as he passed the litter, while Ebbo, on his side, signed to him to speed on and prepare their mother.  Long, however, before the castle was reached, dizzy confusion and leaden helplessness, when no longer stimulated by his brother’s presence, so grew on him that it was with much ado that Heinz could keep him in his saddle; but, when he saw his mother in the castle gateway, he again collected his forces, bade Heinz withdraw his supporting arm, and, straightening himself, waved a greeting to her, as he called cheerily; “Victory, dear mother.  Ebbo has overthrown the count, and you must not be grieved if it be at some cost of blood.”",mother sake good steed entreat much difficulty lift back cream colour stand understand exigency moment sit wave hand pass litter side sign speed prepare mother long castle reach dizzy confusion leaden helplessness stimulate brother presence grow much ado keep saddle see mother castle gateway collect force bid withdraw support arm straighten wave greeting call victory dear mother overthrown count grieve cost blood 
40,"“Alas, my son!” was all Christina could say, for his effort at gaiety formed a ghastly contrast with the gray, livid hue that overspread his fair young face, his bloody armour, and damp disordered hair, and even his stiff unearthly smile.",son say effort gaiety form ghastly contrast gray livid hue overspread fair young face bloody armour damp disorder hair stiff unearthly smile 
41,"“Nay, motherling,” he added, as she came so near that he could put his arm round her neck, “sorrow not, for Ebbo will need thee much.  And, mother,” as his face lighted up, “there is joy coming to you.  Only I would that I could have brought him.  Mother, he died not under the Schlangenwald swords.”",motherling add come put arm neck sorrow need much mother face light be joy come bring mother die sword 
42,“Who?  Not Ebbo?” cried the bewildered mother.,cry bewilder mother 
43,"“Your own Eberhard, our father,” said Friedel, raising her face to him with his hand, and adding, as he met a startled look, “The cruel count owned it with his last breath.  He is a Turkish slave, and surely heaven will give him back to comfort you, even though we may not work his freedom!  O mother, I had so longed for it, but God be thanked that at least certainty was bought by my life.”  The last words were uttered almost unconsciously, and he had nearly fallen, as the excitement faded; but, as they were lifting him down, he bent once more and kissed the glossy neck of his horse.  “Ah! poor fellow, thou too wilt be lonely. May Ebbo yet ride thee!”",own father say raise face hand add meet startle look cruel count own last breath turkish slave heaven give comfort work freedom mother long thank least certainty buy life last word utter fall excitement fade lift bend kiss glossy neck horse poor fellow lonely ride 
44,"The mother had no time for grief.  Alas!  She might have full time for that by and by!  The one wish of the twins was to be together, and presently both were laid on the great bed in the upper chamber, Ebbo in a swoon from the pain of the transport, and Friedel lying so as to meet the first look of recovery.  And, after Ebbo’s eyes had re-opened, they watched one another in silence for a short space, till Ebbo said: “Is that the hue of death on thy face, brother?”",mother have time grief have full time wish twin lay great bed upper chamber swoon pain transport lie meet first look recovery eye re-open watch silence short space say hue death face brother 
45,"“I well believe so,” said Friedel.",believe say 
46,"“Ever together,” said Ebbo, holding his hand.  “But alas!  My mother! Would I had never sent thee to the traitor.”",say hold hand mother send traitor 
47,"“Ah!  So comes her comfort,” said Friedel.  “Heard you not?  He owned that my father was among the Turks.”",come comfort say heard own father 
48,"“And I,” cried Ebbo.  “I have withheld thee!  O Friedel, had I listened to thee, thou hadst not been in this fatal broil!”",cry withhold listen fatal broil 
49,"“Nay, ever together,” repeated Friedel.  “Through Ulm merchants will my mother be able to ransom him.  I know she will, so oft have I dreamt of his return.  Then, mother, you will give him our duteous greetings;” and he smiled again.",repeat merchant mother able ransom know dreamt return mother give duteous greeting smile 
50,"Like one in a dream Christina returned his smile, because she saw he wished it, just as the moment before she had been trying to staunch his wound.",dream return smile see wish moment try staunch wound 
51,"It was plain that the injuries, except Ebbo’s sword-cut, were far beyond her skill, and she could only endeavour to check the bleeding till better aid could be obtained from Ulm.  Thither Moritz Schleiermacher had already sent, and he assured her that he was far from despairing of the elder baron, but she derived little hope from his words, for gunshot wounds were then so ill understood as generally to prove fatal.",plain injury sword cut skill endeavour check bleeding good aid obtain send assure despair elder baron derive little hope word gunshot wound ill understand prove fatal 
52,"Moreover, there was an undefined impression that the two lives must end in the same hour, even as they had begun.  Indeed, Ebbo was suffering so terribly, and was so much spent with pain and loss of blood, that he seemed sinking much faster than Friedel, whose wound bled less freely, and who only seemed benumbed and torpid, except when he roused himself to speak, or was distressed by the writhings and moans which, however, for his sake, Ebbo restrained as much as he could.",be undefined impression life end same hour begin suffer spend pain loss blood seem sink fast wound ble seem benumbed torpid rouse speak distress writhing moan sake restrain 
53,"To be together seemed an all-sufficient consolation, and, when the chaplain came sorrowfully to give them the last rites of the Church, Ebbo implored him to pray that he might not be left behind long in purgatory.",seem sufficient consolation chaplain come give last rite implore pray leave purgatory 
54,"“Friedel,” he said, clasping his brother’s hand, “is even like the holy Sebastian or Maurice; but I—I was never such as he.  O father, will it be my penance to be left alone when he is in paradise?”",say clasp brother hand holy such o father penance leave alone paradise 
55,"“What is that?” said Friedel, partially roused by the sound of his name, and the involuntary pressure of his hand.  “Nay, Ebbo; one repentance, one cross, one hope,” and he relapsed into a doze, while Ebbo murmured over a broken, brief confession—exhausting by its vehemence of self-accusation for his proud spirit, his wilful neglect of his lost father, his hot contempt of prudent counsel.",say rouse sound name involuntary pressure hand repentance cross hope relaps doze murmure break brief confession exhausting vehemence self accusation proud spirit wilful neglect lose father hot contempt prudent counsel 
56,"Then, when the priest came round to Friedel’s side, and the boy was wakened to make his shrift, the words were contrite and humble, but calm and full of trust.  They were like two of their own mountain streams, the waters almost equally undefiled by external stain—yet one struggling, agitated, whirling giddily round; the other still, transparent, and the light of heaven smiling in its clearness.",priest come side boy waken make shrift word contrite humble calm full trust own mountain stream water undefile external stain struggle agitate whirl other transparent light heaven smile clearness 
57,"The farewell greetings of the Church on earth breathed soft and sweet in their loftiness, and Friedel, though lying motionless, and with closed eyes, never failed in the murmured response, whether fully conscious or not, while his brother only attended by fits and starts, and was evidently often in too much pain to know what was passing.",farewell greeting earth breathe soft sweet loftiness lie motionless close eye fail murmure response conscious brother attend fit start much pain know pass 
58,"Help was nearer than had been hoped.  The summons despatched the night before had been responded to by the vintners and mercers; their train bands had set forth, and their captain, a cautious man, never rode into the way of blows without his surgeon at hand.  And so it came to pass that, before the sun was low on that long and grievous day, Doctor Johannes Butteman was led into the upper chamber, where the mother looked up to him with a kind of hopeless gratitude on her face, which was nearly as white as those of her sons.  The doctor soon saw that Friedel was past human aid; but, when he declared that there was fair hope for the other youth, Friedel, whose torpor had been dispelled by the examination, looked up with his beaming smile, saying, “There, motherling.”",help nearer hope summons despatch night respond vintner mercer train band set captain cautious man ride way blow surgeon hand come pass sun low long grievous day lead upper chamber mother look kind hopeless gratitude face white son doctor see human aid declare be fair hope other youth torpor dispell examination look beam smile say motherling 
59,"The doctor then declared that he could not deal with the Baron’s wound unless he were the sole occupant of the bed, and this sentence brought the first cloud of grief or dread to Friedel’s brow, but only for a moment.  He looked at his brother, who had again fainted at the first touch of his wounded limb, and said, “It is well.  Tell the dear Ebbo that I cannot help it if after all I go to the praying, and leave him the fighting.  Dear, dear Ebbo!  One day together again and for ever!  I leave thee for thine own sake.”  With much effort he signed the cross again on his brother’s brow, and kissed it long and fervently.  Then, as all stood round, reluctant to effect this severance, or disturb one on whom death was visibly fast approaching, he struggled up on his elbow, and held out the other hand, saying, “Take me now, Heinz, ere Ebbo revive to be grieved.  The last sacrifice,” he further whispered, whilst almost giving himself to Heinz and Moritz to be carried to his own bed in the turret chamber.",doctor declare deal wound sole occupant bed sentence bring first cloud grief dread brow moment look brother faint first touch wound limb say well tell dear help go praying leave fighting dear dear day leave own sake much effort sign cross brother brow kiss stand reluctant effect severance disturb death fast approach struggle elbow hold other hand say take revive grieve last sacrifice whisper give carry own bed turret chamber 
60,"There, even as they laid him down, began what seemed to be the mortal agony, and, though he was scarcely sensible, his mother felt that her prime call was to him, while his brother was in other hands.  Perhaps it was well for her.  Surgical practice was rough, and wounds made by fire-arms were thought to have imbibed a poison that made treatment be supposed efficacious in proportion to the pain inflicted.  When Ebbo was recalled by the torture to see no white reflection of his own face on the pillow beside him, and to feel in vain for the grasp of the cold damp hand, a delirious frenzy seized him, and his struggles were frustrating the doctor’s attempts, when a low soft sweet song stole through the open door.",lay begin seem mortal agony sensible mother feel prime call brother other hand surgical practice rough wound make fire arm think imbibe poison make treatment suppose efficacious proportion pain inflict recall torture see white reflection own face pillow feel vain grasp cold damp hand delirious frenzy seize struggle frustrating doctor attempt low soft sweet song steal open door 
61,"“Friedel!” he murmured, and held his breath to listen.  All through the declining day did the gentle sound continue; now of grand chants or hymns caught from the cathedral choir, now of songs of chivalry or saintly legend so often sung over the evening fire; the one flowing into the other in the wandering of failing powers, but never failing in the tender sweetness that had distinguished Friedel through life.  And, whenever that voice was heard, let them do to him what they would, Ebbo was still absorbed in intense listening so as not to lose a note, and lulled almost out of sense of suffering by that swan-like music.  If his attendants made such noise as to break in on it, or if it ceased for a moment, the anguish returned, but was charmed away by the weakest, faintest resumption of the song.  Probably Friedel knew not, with any earthly sense, what he was doing, but to the very last he was serving his twin brother as none other could have aided him in his need.",murmure hold breath listen decline day gentle sound continue grand chant hymn catch cathedral choir song chivalry saintly legend sung evening fire one flow other wonder fail power fail tender sweetness distinguish life voice hear let do absorb intense listening lose note lull sense suffering swan music attendant make such noise break cease moment anguish return charm weak faintest resumption song know earthly sense do very last serve twin brother other aid need 
62,"The September sun had set, twilight was coming on, the doctor had worked his stern will, and Ebbo, quivering in every fibre, lay spent on his pillow, when his mother glided in, and took her seat near him, though where she hoped he would not notice her presence.  But he raised his eyelids, and said, “He is not singing now.”",sun set twilight come doctor work stern will quiver fibre lay spend pillow mother glide take seat hope notice presence raise eyelid say sing 
63,"“Singing indeed, but where we cannot hear him,” she answered.  “‘Whiter than the snow, clearer than the ice-cave, more solemn than the choir. They will come at last.’  That was what he said, even as he entered there.”  And the low dove-like tone and tender calm face continued upon Ebbo the spell that the chant had left.  He dozed as though still lulled by its echo.",sing hear answer whit snow clear ice cave solemn choir come last say enter low dove like tone tender calm face continue spell chant leave doze lull echo
