1,"CHAPTER VIII. Kind Little Edmund, or The Caves and the Cockatrice",kind little 
2," Edmund was a boy. The people who did not like him said that he was the most tiresome boy that ever lived, but his grandmother and his other friends said that he had an inquiring mind. And his granny often added that he was the best of boys. But she was very kind and very old.",boy person like say tiresome boy live grandmother other friend say have inquire mind granny add good boy kind old 
3,"Edmund loved to find out about things. Perhaps you will think that in that case he was constant in his attendance at school, since there, if anywhere, we may learn whatever there is to be learned. But Edmund did not want to learn things: He wanted to find things out, which is quite different. His inquiring mind led him to take clocks to pieces to see what made them go, to take locks off doors to see what made them stick. It was Edmund who cut open the India rubber ball to see what made it bounce, and he never did see, any more than you did when you tried the same experiment.",love find thing think case constant attendance school learn be learn want learn thing want find thing different inquire mind lead take clock piece see make go take lock door see make stick cut open rubber ball see make bounce see more try same experiment 
4,"Edmund lived with his grandmother. She loved him very much, in spite of his inquiring mind, and hardly scolded him at all when he frizzled up her tortoiseshell comb in his anxiety to find out whether it was made of real tortoiseshell or of something that would burn. Edmund went to school, of course, now and then, and sometimes he could not prevent himself from learning something, but he never did it on purpose.",live grandmother love spite inquire mind scold frizzle tortoiseshell comb anxiety find make real tortoiseshell burn go school course prevent learn do purpose 
5,"""It is such waste of time,"" said he. ""They only know what everybody knows. I want to find out new things that nobody has thought of but me.""",such waste time say know know want find new thing think 
6,"""I don't think you're likely to find out anything that none of the wise men in the whole world have thought of all these thousands of years,"" said Granny.",think likely find wise man whole world think thousand year say 
7,"But Edmund did not agree with her. He played truant whenever he could, for he was a kindhearted boy, and could not bear to think of a master's time and labor being thrown away on a boy like himself--who did not wish to learn, only to find out--when there were so many worthy lads thirsting for instruction in geography and history and reading and ciphering, and Mr. Smiles's ""Self-Help.""",agree play truant kindhearted boy bear think master time labor throw boy wish learn find be many worthy lad thirst instruction geography history reading ciphering self help 
8,"Other boys played truant too, of course--and these went nutting or blackberrying or wild plum gathering, but Edmund never went on the side of the town where the green woods and hedges grew. He always went up the mountain where the great rocks were, and the tall, dark pine trees, and where other people were afraid to go because of the strange noises that came out of the caves.",other boy play truant course go nutting blackberry wild plum gathering go side town green wood hedge grow go mountain great rock tall dark pine tree other person afraid go strange noise come cave 
9,Edmund was not afraid of these noises--though they were very strange and terrible. He wanted to find out what made them.,afraid noise strange terrible want find make 
10,"One day he did. He had invented, all by himself, a very ingenious and new kind of lantern, made with a turnip and a tumbler, and when he took the candle out of Granny's bedroom candlestick to put in it, it gave quite a splendid light.",day invent ingenious new kind lantern make turnip tumbler take candle bedroom candlestick put give splendid light 
11,"He had to go to school next day, and he was caned for being absent without leave--although he very straightforwardly explained that he had been too busy making the lantern to have time to come to school.",have go school next day cane absent leave explain busy make lantern have time come school 
12,But the day after he got up very early and took the lunch Granny had ready for him to take to school--two boiled eggs and an apple turnover--and he took his lantern and went off as straight as a dart to the mountains to explore the caves.,day get take lunch have ready take school boil egg apple turnover take lantern go dart mountain explore cave 
13,"The caves were very dark, but his lantern lighted them up beautifully; and they were most interesting caves, with stalactites and stalagmites and fossils, and all the things you read about in the instructive books for the young. But Edmund did not care for any of these things just then. He wanted to find out what made the noises that people were afraid of, and there was nothing in the caves to tell him.",cave dark lantern light interesting cave stalactite stalagmite fossil thing read instructive book young care thing want find make noise person afraid be cave tell 
14,"Presently he sat down in the biggest cave and listened very carefully, and it seemed to him that he could distinguish three different sorts of noises. There was a heavy rumbling sound, like a very large old gentleman asleep after dinner; and there was a smaller sort of rumble going on at the same time; and there was a sort of crowing, clucking sound, such as a chicken might make if it happened to be as big as a haystack.",sit big cave listen seem distinguish different sort noise be heavy rumbling sound large old gentleman asleep dinner be small sort rumble go same time be sort crowing cluck sound such chicken make happen big haystack 
15,"""It seems to me,"" said Edmund to himself, ""that the clucking is nearer than the others."" So he started up again and explored the caves once more. He found out nothing, but about halfway up the wall of the cave, he saw a hole. And, being a boy, he climbed up to it and crept in; and it was the entrance to a rocky passage. And now the clucking sounded more plainly than before, and he could hardly hear the rumbling at all.",seem say clucking nearer other start explore cave more find wall cave see hole boy climb creep entrance rocky passage clucking sound hear rumbling 
16,"""I _am_ going to find out something at last,"" said Edmund, and on he went. The passage wound and twisted, and twisted and turned, and turned and wound, but Edmund kept on.",go find last say go passage wound twist twist turn turn wound keep 
17,"""My lantern's burning better and better,"" said he presently, but the next minute he saw that all the light did not come from his lantern. It was a pale yellow light, and it shone down the passage far ahead of him through what looked like the chink of a door.",lantern burn good good say next minute see light come lantern pale yellow light shine passage look chink door 
18,"""I expect it's the fire in the middle of the earth,"" said Edmund, who had not been able to help learning about that at school.",expect fire middle earth say able help learn school 
19,But quite suddenly the fire ahead gave a pale flicker and went down; and the clucking ceased.,fire give pale flicker go clucking cease 
20,"The next moment Edmund turned a corner and found himself in front of a rocky door. The door was ajar. He went in, and there was a round cave, like the dome of St. Paul's. In the middle of the cave was a hole like a very big hand-washing basin, and in the middle of the basin Edmund saw a large pale person sitting.",next moment turn corner find front rocky door door ajar go be round cave dome middle cave hole big hand washing basin middle basin see large pale person sit

22,"""Whatever are you?"" said Edmund.",say 
23,"""I'm a poor starving cockatrice,"" answered the pale person in a very faint voice, ""and I shall die--oh, I know I shall! My fire's gone out! I can't think how it happened; I must have been asleep. I have to stir it seven times round with my tail once in a hundred years to keep it alight, and my watch must have been wrong. And now I shall die.""",poor starve cockatrice answer pale person faint voice die know fire go think happen asleep have stir time tail year keep watch wrong die 
24,I think I have said before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was.,think say kindhearted boy 
25,"""Cheer up,"" said he. ""I'll light your fire for you."" And off he went, and in a few minutes he came back with a great armful of sticks from the pine trees outside, and with these and a lesson book or two that he had forgotten to lose before, and which, quite by an oversight, were safe in his pocket, he lit a fire all around the cockatrice. The wood blazed up, and presently something in the basin caught fire, and Edmund saw that it was a sort of liquid that burned like the brandy in a snapdragon. And now the cockatrice stirred it with his tail and flapped his wings in it so that some of it splashed out on Edmund's hand and burnt it rather badly. But the cockatrice grew red and strong and happy, and its comb grew scarlet, and its feathers glossy, and it lifted itself up and crowed ""Cock-a-trice-a-doodle-doo!"" very loudly and clearly.",cheer say light fire go few minute come great armful stick pine tree lesson book forget lose oversight safe pocket light fire cockatrice wood blaze basin catch fire see sort liquid burn brandy snapdragon cockatrice stirr tail flapp wing splash hand burn cockatrice grow red strong happy comb grow scarlet feather glossy lift crow

32,"And Edmund ate his eggs and his turnover, and listened. And when he got hungry again he said good-bye and went home. But he came again the next day for more stories, and the next day, and the next, for a long time.",eat egg turnover listen get hungry say good bye go come next day more story next day next long time

34,"""But it's true,"" said Edmund. ""Just you look where the fire burnt my hand.""",true say look fire burn hand 
35,"""I see you've been playing with fire--into mischief as usual,"" said the master, and he caned Edmund harder than ever. The master was ignorant and unbelieving: but I am told that some schoolmasters are not like that.",see play fire mischief usual say master cane hard master ignorant unbelieving tell schoolmaster 
36,"Now, one day Edmund made a new lantern out of something chemical that he sneaked from the school laboratory. And with it he went exploring again to see if he could find the things that made the other sorts of noises. And in quite another part of the mountain he found a dark passage, all lined with brass, so that it was like the inside of a huge telescope, and at the very end of it he found a bright green door. There was a brass plate on the door that said MRS. D. KNOCK AND RING, and a white label that said CALL ME AT THREE. Edmund had a watch: It had been given to him on his birthday two days before, and he had not yet had time to take it to pieces and see what made it go, so it was still going. He looked at it now. It said a quarter to three.",day make new lantern chemical sneak school laboratory go explore see find thing make other sort noise part mountain find dark passage line brass inside huge telescope very end find bright green door be brass plate door say white label say call have watch give birthday day have time take piece see make go go look say quarter 
37,"Did I tell you before what a kindhearted boy Edmund was? He sat down on the brass doorstep and waited till three o'clock. Then he knocked and rang, and there was a rattling and puffing inside. The great door flew open, and Edmund had only just time to hide behind it when out came an immense yellow dragon, who wriggled off down the brass cave like a long, rattling worm--or perhaps more like a monstrous centipede.",tell kindhearted boy sit brass doorstep wait o'clock knock ring be rattling puffing great door fly open have time hide come immense yellow dragon wriggle brass cave long rattling worm monstrous centipede 
38,"Edmund crept slowly out and saw the dragon stretching herself on the rocks in the sun, and he crept past the great creature and tore down the hill into the town and burst into school, crying out: ""There's a great dragon coming! Somebody ought to do something, or we shall all be destroyed.""",creep see dragon stretch rock sun creep great creature tore hill town burst school cry be great dragon come do destroy 
39,He was caned for untruthfulness without any delay. His master was never one for postponing a duty.,cane untruthfulness delay master postpon duty

41,"He pointed out of the window, and everyone could see a vast yellow cloud rising up into the air above the mountain.",point window see vast yellow cloud rise air mountain 
42,"""It's only a thunder shower,"" said the master, and caned Edmund more than ever. This master was not like some masters I know: He was very obstinate, and would not believe his own eyes if they told him anything different from what he had been saying before his eyes spoke.",thunder shower say master cane more master master know obstinate believe own eye tell different say eye speak 
43,"So while the master was writing _Lying is very wrong, and liars must be caned. It is all for their own good_ on the black-board for Edmund to copy out seven hundred times, Edmund sneaked out of school and ran for his life across the town to warn his granny, but she was not at home. So then he made off through the back door of the town, and raced up the hill to tell the cockatrice and ask for his help. It never occurred to him that the cockatrice might not believe him. You see, he had heard so many wonderful tales from him and had believed them all--and when you believe all a person's stories they ought to believe yours. This is only fair.",master write wrong liar cane own good_ black board copy time sneak school run life town warn granny home make back door town race hill tell cockatrice ask help occur cockatrice believe see hear many wonderful tale believe believe person story believe fair 
44,"At the mouth of the cockatrice's cave Edmund stopped, very much out of breath, to look back at the town. As he ran he had felt his little legs tremble and shake, while the shadows of the great yellow cloud fell upon him. Now he stood once more between warm earth and blue sky, and looked down on the green plain dotted with fruit trees and red-roofed farms and plots of gold corn. In the middle of that plain the gray town lay, with its strong walls with the holes pierced for the archers, and its square towers with holes for dropping melted lead on the heads of strangers; its bridges and its steeples; the quiet river edged with willow and alder; and the pleasant green garden place in the middle of the town, where people sat on holidays to smoke their pipes and listen to the band.",mouth cockatrice cave stop breath look town run feel little leg tremble shake shadow great yellow cloud fall stand warm earth blue sky look green plain dot fruit tree red roof farm plot gold corn middle plain gray town lay strong wall hole pierce archer square tower hole drop melt lead head stranger bridge steeple quiet river edged willow alder pleasant green garden place middle town person sit holiday smoke pipe listen band 
45,"Edmund saw it all; and he saw, too, creeping across the plain, marking her way by a black line as everything withered at her touch, the great yellow dragon--and he saw that she was many times bigger than the whole town.",see see creep plain mark way black line wither touch great yellow dragon see many time big whole town 
46,"""Oh, my poor, dear granny,"" said Edmund, for he had a feeling heart, as I ought to have told you before.",poor dear granny say have feeling heart tell 
47,"The yellow dragon crept nearer and nearer, licking her greedy lips with her long red tongue, and Edmund knew that in the school his master was still teaching earnestly and still not believing Edmund's tale the least little bit.",yellow dragon creep lick greedy lip long red tongue know school master teach believe tale least little bit 
48,"""He'll jolly well have to believe it soon, anyhow,"" said Edmund to himself, and though he was a very tender-hearted boy--I think it only fair to tell you that he was this--I am afraid he was not as sorry as he ought to have been to think of the way in which his master was going to learn how to believe what Edmund said. Then the dragon opened her jaws wider and wider and wider. Edmund shut his eyes, for though his master was in the town, the amiable Edmund shrank from beholding the awful sight.",have believe say tender hearted boy think fair tell afraid sorry think way master go learn believe say dragon open jaw wide wide wide shut eye master town amiable shrank behold awful sight 
49,"When he opened his eyes again there was no town--only a bare place where it had stood, and the dragon licking her lips and curling herself up to go to sleep, just as Kitty does when she has quite finished with a mouse. Edmund gasped once or twice, and then ran into the cave to tell the cockatrice.",open eye be town bare place stand dragon lick lip curl go sleep finish mouse gasp run cave tell cockatrice 
50,"""Well,"" said the cockatrice thoughtfully, when the tale had been told. ""What then?""",say cockatrice tale tell

54,"""But I live there,"" said Edmund blankly.",live say 
55,"""Never mind,"" said the cockatrice, turning over in the pool of fire to warm its other side, which was chilly, because Edmund had, as usual, forgotten to close the cave door. ""You can live here with me.""",mind say cockatrice turn pool fire warm other side chilly usual forget close cave door live

58,"""Of course it is,"" said Edmund, losing patience at last. ""Oh--do help me. What can I do?""",course say lose patience last help do 
59,"""If I were you,"" said his friend, stretching itself out in the pool of flame so that the waves covered him up to his chin, ""I should find the drakling and bring it here.""",say friend stretch pool flame wave cover chin find drakling bring

61,"""Oh, don't talk to me!"" he said, splashing angrily in the flames. ""I give you advice; take it or leave it--I shan't bother about you anymore.

62,"And the cockatrice drew the fire up close around his shoulders, tucked himself up in it, and went to sleep.",cockatrice draw fire close shoulder tuck go sleep 
63,"Now this was exactly the right way to manage Edmund, only no one had ever thought of trying to do it before.",right way manage think try do 
64,"He stood for a moment looking at the cockatrice; the cockatrice looked at Edmund out of the corner of his eye and began to snore very loudly, and Edmund understood, once and for all, that the cockatrice wasn't going to put up with any nonsense. He respected the cockatrice very much from that moment, and set off at once to do exactly as he was told--for perhaps the first time in his life.",stand moment look cockatrice cockatrice look corner eye begin snore understand cockatrice go put nonsense respect cockatrice moment set do tell first time life 
65,"Though he had played truant so often, he knew one or two things that perhaps you don't know, though you have always been so good and gone to school regularly. For instance, he knew that a drakling is a dragon's baby, and he felt sure that what he had to do was to find the third of the three noises that people used to hear coming from the mountains. Of course, the clucking had been the cockatrice, and the big noise like a large gentleman asleep after dinner had been the big dragon. So the smaller rumbling must have been the drakling.",play truant know thing know good go school instance know drakling dragon baby feel sure have do find third noise person use hear come mountain course clucking cockatrice big noise large gentleman asleep dinner big dragon small rumbling drakling 
66,"He plunged boldly into the caves and searched and wandered and wandered and searched, and at last he came to a third door in the mountain, and on it was written THE BABY IS ASLEEP. Just before the door stood fifty pairs of copper shoes, and no one could have looked at them for a moment without seeing what sort of feet they were made for, for each shoe had five holes in it for the drakling's five claws. And there were fifty pairs because the drakling took after his mother, and had a hundred feet--no more and no less. He was the kind called _Draco centipedis_ in the learned books.",plunge cave search wander wander search last come third door mountain write baby asleep door stand pair copper shoe look moment see sort foot make shoe have hole drakling claw be pair drakling take mother have foot more less kind call centipedis_ learn book 
67,"Edmund was a good deal frightened, but he remembered the grim expression of the cockatrice's eye, and the fixed determination of his snore still rang in his ears, in spite of the snoring of the drakling, which was, in itself, considerable. He screwed up his courage, flung the door open, and called out: ""Hello, you drakling. Get out of bed this minute.""",good deal frighten remember grim expression cockatrice eye fix determination snore ring ear spite snoring drakling considerable screw courage flung door open call drakl get bed minute

70,"The drakling sighed, and Edmund could hear it getting out of bed. The next moment it began to come out of its room and to put on its shoes. It was not nearly so big as its mother; only about the size of a Baptist chapel.",drakling sigh hear get bed next moment begin come room put shoe big mother size chapel 
71,"""Hurry up,"" said Edmund, as it fumbled clumsily with the seventeenth shoe.",hurry say fumble seventeenth shoe

76,"The drakling sat down and waited, but it watched the fire with hungry eyes.",drakling sit wait watch fire hungry eye

78,It reached out a claw toward the cockatrice's basin.,reach claw cockatrice basin

80,"""I beg your pardon,"" said the drakling humbly, ""but I am really _very_ hungry.""",beg pardon say drakling hungry 
81,"The cockatrice beckoned Edmund to the side of the basin and whispered in his ear so long and so earnestly that one side of the dear boy's hair was quite burnt off. And he never once interrupted the cockatrice to ask why. But when the whispering was over, Edmund--whose heart, as I may have mentioned, was very tender--said to the drakling: ""If you are really hungry, poor thing, I can show you where there is plenty of fire."" And off he went through the caves, and the drakling followed.",cockatrice beckon side basin whisper ear side dear boy hair burn interrupt cockatrice ask whispering heart mention tender say drakling hungry poor thing show be plenty fire go cave drakling follow 
82,When Edmund came to the proper place he stopped.,come proper place stop 
83,"There was a round iron thing in the floor, like the ones the men shoot the coals down into your cellar, only much larger. Edmund heaved it up by a hook that stuck out at one side, and a rush of hot air came up that nearly choked him. But the drakling came close and looked down with one eye and sniffed, and said: ""That smells good, eh?""",be round iron thing floor one man shoot coal cellar large heave hook stick side rush hot air come choke drakling come look eye sniff say smell good

85,"So the drakling wriggled through the hole, and began to crawl faster and faster down the slanting shaft that leads to the fire in the middle of the earth. And Edmund, doing exactly as he had been told, for a wonder, caught the end of the drakling's tail and ran the iron hook through it so that the drakling was held fast. And it could not turn around and wriggle up again to look after its poor tail, because, as everyone knows, the way to the fires below is very easy to go down, but quite impossible to come back on.

93,"[""That smells good, eh?"" _See page 152._]",smell good see page 
94,"""At you,"" said Edmund, and went on laughing. The dragon bore it as long as she could, but, like everyone else, she couldn't stand being made fun of, so presently she dragged herself up the mountain very slowly, because she had just had a rather heavy meal, and stood outside and said, ""What are you laughing at?"" in a voice that made Edmund feel as if he should never laugh again.",say go laugh dragon bear else stand make fun drag mountain have heavy meal stand say laugh voice make feel laugh

96,"And Edmund found the courage to cry ""Ha, ha!"" which sounded like tremendous laughter in the echo of the cave.",find courage cry sound tremendous laughter echo cave

And with that she coughed--and choked--and there was the town, on the hillside.",say dragon _thought town stick throat take look cough choke be town hillside 
98,"Edmund had run back to the cockatrice, and it had told him what to do. So before the dragon had time to look through the town again for her drakling, the voice of the drakling itself was heard howling miserably from inside the mountain, because Edmund was pinching its tail as hard as he could in the round iron door, like the one where the men pour the coals out of the sacks into the cellar. And the dragon heard the voice and said: ""Why, whatever's the matter with Baby? He's not here!"" and made herself thin, and crept into the mountain to find her drakling. The cockatrice kept on laughing as loud as it could, and Edmund kept on pinching, and presently the great dragon--very long and narrow she had made herself--found her head where the round hole was with the iron lid. Her tail was a mile or two off--outside the mountain. When Edmund heard her coming he gave one last nip to the drakling's tail, and then heaved up the lid and stood behind it, so that the dragon could not see him. Then he loosed the drakling's tail from the hook, and the dragon peeped down the hole just in time to see her drakling's tail disappear down the smooth, slanting shaft with one last squeak of pain. Whatever may have been the poor dragon's other faults, she was an excellent mother. She plunged headfirst into the hole, and slid down the shaft after her baby. Edmund watched her head go--and then the rest of her. She was so long, now she had stretched herself thin, that it took all night. It was like watching a goods train go by in Germany. When the last joint of her tail had gone Edmund slammed down the iron door. He was a kindhearted boy, as you have guessed, and he was glad to think that dragon and drakling would now have plenty to eat of their favorite food, forever and ever. He thanked the cockatrice for his kindness, and got home just in time to have breakfast and get to school by nine.
