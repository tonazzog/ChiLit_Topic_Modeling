1,CHAPTER 22. Plassey.,
2," As the English troops advanced, they were met on the outskirts of the settlement by the enemy, who contested bravely every garden and inclosure with them. The British force was, however, too strong to be resisted, and gradually the French were driven back, until they formed in rear of the battery. Clive at once took possession of the houses surrounding it, and from them kept up, all day, a heavy fire upon the defenders; until, at nightfall, these fell back upon the fort, after spiking their guns. The loss of this position compelled the French to abandon the other outlying batteries, from which, during the night, they withdrew their guns into the fort.",english troops advance meet outskirt settlement enemy contest garden inclosure british force strong resist drive form rear battery take possession house surround keep day heavy fire defender nightfall fall fort spike gun loss position compel abandon other outly battery night withdraw gun fort 
3,"The next four days Clive spent in bringing up the guns landed from the fleet, and establishing batteries round the fort; and on the 19th he opened fire against it. On the same day the three men of war; the Kent of sixty-four guns, the Tiger of sixty, and the Salisbury of fifty, anchored just below the channel, which the governor believed he had blocked up. The next four days were spent by the fleet in sounding, to discover whether the statements of the French deserter were correct.",next day spend bring gun land fleet establish battery fort 19th open fire same day man war gun anchore channel governor believe block next day spend fleet sound discover statement french deserter correct 
4,"During this time, a heavy cannonade was kept up unceasingly between Clive and the fort. In this the garrison had the best of it, silenced some of the English guns, killed many of the assailants, and would certainly have beaten off the land attack, had the fleet not been able to interfere in the struggle.",time heavy cannonade keep fort garrison have good silence english gun kill many assailant beat land attack have fleet able interfere struggle 
5,"All this time, the governor was hoping that aid would arrive from the nabob. The latter, indeed, did send a force under Rajah Dulab Ram, but the governor of Hoogly, bribed by Omichund, sent messages to this officer urging him to halt, as Chandranagore was about to surrender, and he would only incur the anger of the English, uselessly.",time governor hope aid arrive nabob latter send force governor bribe send message officer urge halt about surrender incur anger 
6,"On the morning of the 23rd, having ascertained that a channel was free, the fleet advanced. The Tiger, leading, made her way through the passage and, taking up a position abreast of the northeast bastion of the fort, opened a heavy fire upon it with her guns, and harassed the besieged with a musketry fire from her tops. The Kent was on the point of anchoring opposite the watergate, when so heavy a fire was poured upon her that, in the confusion, the cable ran out; and the ship dropped down, till she anchored at a point exposed to a heavy crossfire from the southeast and southwest bastions. Owing to this accident, the Salisbury was forced to anchor a hundred and fifty yards below the fort.",morning 23rd ascertain channel free fleet advance lead make way passage take position northeast bastion fort open heavy fire gun harass besiege musketry fire top point anchor watergate heavy fire pour confusion cable run ship drop anchore point expose heavy crossfire southeast southwest bastion owe accident force anchor yard fort 
7,"The French fought with extreme bravery. Vastly superior as were the English force and guns, the French fire was maintained with the greatest energy and spirit, the gunners being directed and animated by Monsieur De Vignes, captain of one of the ships which had been sunk. No advantage was gained by the Tiger, in her struggle with the northeast bastion, and the guns of the southwest bastion galled the Kent so severely that the admiral, neglecting the southeast bastion, was forced to turn the whole of his guns upon it.",fight extreme bravery superior english force gun french fire maintain great energy spirit gunner direct animate captain ship sink advantage gain struggle northeast bastion gun bastion gall admiral neglect southeast bastion force turn whole gun 
8,"De Vignes concentrated his fire against one point in the Kent, and presently succeeded in setting her on fire. The conflagration spread, a panic ensued, and some seventy or eighty men jumped into the boats alongside.",concentrate fire point succeed set fire conflagration spread panic ensue man jump boat 
9,"The officers, however, rallied the rest of the crew. The fire was extinguished, the men returned to their duty, and the cannonade was recommenced.",officer rally rest crew fire extinguish man return duty cannonade recommence 
10,"After the battle had raged for two hours, the fire of the fort began to slacken, as one after another of the guns was dismounted. Monsieur Renault saw that the place could be no longer defended. Of his hundred and forty-six soldiers, over ninety had been killed and wounded. Collecting the remainder, and their officers, with twenty Sepoys, the governor ordered them to leave the fort immediately; making a detour to avoid the English, who were aiding the fleet by attacking the land side, and to march to Kossimbazar to join Monsieur Law, who commanded there. Then, there remaining in the fort only the clerks, women, and wounded, he hoisted a flag of truce.",battle rage hour fire fort begin slack gun dismount see place defend soldier kill wound collect remainder officer governor order leave fort make detour avoid aid fleet attack land side march join command remain clerk woman wound hoist flag truce 
11,"Terms were speedily arranged. The governor, and all the civilians and natives, were allowed to go where they chose, with their clothes and linen. The wounded French soldiers were to remain, as prisoners of war.",term arrange governor civilian native allow go choose clothes linen wound french soldier remain prisoner war 
12,"Chandranagore cost the English two hundred and six men. The attack upon the French colony was blamed by many, at the time, for in the hour of English distress they had offered to remain neutral, instead of joining the nabob in crushing us. Upon the other hand, there was force in the arguments with which Admiral Watson had defended his refusal to sign the treaty of neutrality. That treaty would not be binding, unless ratified by Pondicherry; and to Pondicherry it was known that the most powerful fleet and army France had ever sent to India was on its way. It was also known that Bussy, at the court of the Nizam of the Deccan, was in communication with the nabob. Thus, then, in a short time English interests in India might be menaced more formidably than ever before, and the crushing out of the French colony, almost at the gates of Calcutta, was a measure of extreme importance. It was hard upon the gallant governor of Chandranagore, but public opinion generally agreed that the urgency of the case justified the course adopted by the English authorities at Calcutta.",cost english man attack french colony blame many time hour english distress offer remain neutral join nabob crush other hand be force argument defend refusal sign treaty neutrality treaty bind ratify know powerful fleet army send way know court communication nabob short time english interest menace crush french colony gate measure extreme importance hard gallant governor public opinion agree urgency case justify course adopt english authority 
13,"Suraja-u-Dowlah was filled with fury, at the news of the capture of Chandranagore; but hearing a rumour, two days later, that the Afghans were upon their march to attack him, he wrote letters to Clive and Watson, congratulating them upon their success, and offering to them the territory of Chandranagore, on the same terms upon which it had been held by the French.",fill fury news capture hear rumour day march attack write letter congratulate success offer territory same term hold 
14,"But the young tyrant of Moorshedabad was swayed by constantly fluctuating feeling. At one moment his fears were uppermost; the next, his anger and hate of the English. Instead of recalling the army of Rajah Dulab Ram, as he had promised, he ordered it to halt at Plassey, a large village twenty-two miles south of Moorshedabad.",young tyrant sway fluctuate feeling moment fear uppermost next anger hate recall army promise order halt large village mile 
15,"The English were represented at his court by Mr. Watts, who had the greatest difficulty in maintaining his position, in the constantly changing moods of the nabob. One day the latter would threaten to order him to be led to instant execution, the next he would load him with presents.",represent court have great difficulty maintain position change mood nabob day latter threaten order lead instant execution next load present 
16,"Besides Mr. Watts, the English affairs were conducted by Omichund who, aided by the Sets, or native bankers, whom Suraja-u-Dowlah had plundered and despoiled, got up a conspiracy among the nabob's most intimate followers.",english affair conduct aid set native banker plunder despoil get conspiracy nabob intimate follower 
17,"The history of these intrigues is the most unpleasant feature in the life of Clive. Meer Jaffier, the nabob's general, himself offered to Mr. Watts to turn traitor, if the succession to the kingdom was bestowed upon him. This was agreed to, upon his promise to pay, not only immense sums to the Company, but enormous amounts to the principal persons on the English side. So enormous, indeed, were these demands, that even Meer Jaffier, anxious as he was to conclude the alliance, was aghast. The squadron was to have two million and a half rupees, and the same amount was to be paid for the army. Presents amounting to six millions of rupees were to be distributed between Clive, Major Kilpatrick, the governor, and the members of the council. Clive's share of these enormous sums amounted to two million, eighty thousand rupees. In those days, a rupee was worth half a crown. Never did an English officer make such a bargain for himself.",history intrigue unpleasant feature life nabob general offer turn traitor succession kingdom bestow agree promise pay immense sum company enormous amount principal person english side enormous demand anxious conclude alliance aghast squadron have half rupee same amount pay army present amount million rupee distribute governor member council share enormous sum amount rupee day rupee worth crown do english officer make bargain 
18,"But even this is not the most dishonorable feature of the transaction. Omichund had, for some time, been kept in the dark as to what was going forward; but, obtaining information through his agents, he questioned Mr. Watts concerning it. The latter then informed him of the whole state of affairs, and Omichund, whose services to the English had been immense, naturally demanded a share of the plunder.",dishonorable feature transaction time keep dark go obtain information agent question concern latter inform whole state affair service immense demand share plunder 
19,"Whether or not he threatened to divulge the plot to the nabob, unless his demands were satisfied, is doubtful. At any rate, it was considered prudent to pacify him, and he was accordingly told that he should receive the sum he named. Clive, and the members of the council, however, although willing to gratify their own extortionate greed, at the expense of Meer Jaffier, determined to rob Omichund of his share. In order to do this, two copies of the treaty with Meer Jaffier were drawn up, on different coloured papers. They were exactly alike, except that, in one, the amount to be given to Omichund was entirely omitted. This was the real treaty. The other was intended to be destroyed, after being shown to a friend of Omichund, in order to convince the latter that all was straight and honorable.",threaten divulge plot nabob demand satisfy doubtful rate consider prudent pacify tell receive sum name member council willing gratify own extortionate greed expense determined rob share order do copy treaty draw different coloured paper alike amount give omit real treaty other intend destroy show friend order convince latter straight honorable 
20,"All the English authorities placed their signatures to the real treaty, but Admiral Watson indignantly refused to have anything to do with the fictitious one; or to be a party, in any way, to the deceit practised on Omichund. In order to get out of the difficulty, Clive himself forged Admiral Watson's signature to the fictitious treaty.",english authority place signature real treaty refuse have do fictitious one party way deceit practise order get difficulty forge signature fictitious treaty 
21,"A more disgraceful transaction was never entered into, by a body of English gentlemen. That Mr. Drake and the members of his council, the pitiful cowards who fled from Calcutta, and refused to allow the ships to draw off its brave garrison, should consent to such a transaction was but natural; but that Clive, the gallant and dashing commander, should have stooped to it, is sad, indeed.",disgraceful transaction enter body english gentleman member council pitiful coward flead refuse allow ship draw brave garrison consent transaction natural gallant dash commander stoop sad 
22,"It may be said that, to the end of his life, Clive defended his conduct in this transaction, under the excuse that Omichund was a scoundrel. The Indian was not, indeed, an estimable character. Openly, he was the friend and confidant of the nabob while, all the time, he was engaged in bribing and corrupting his officers, and in plotting with his enemies. This, however, in no way alters the facts that he rendered inestimable service to the English; and that the men who deceived and cheated him were, to the full, as greedy and grasping as himself; without, in the case of the governor and his council, having rendered any service whatever to the cause.",say end life defend conduct transaction excuse scoundrel estimable character friend confidant nabob time engage bribe corrupt officer plot enemy way alter fact render inestimable service man deceive cheat full greedy grasp case governor council render service cause 
23,"At last, the negotiations were complete. More and more severely did Clive press upon the nabob. Having compelled him to expel Law and the French, first from Moorshedabad and then from his dominions, he pressed fresh demands upon him; until the unfortunate prince, driven to despair, and buoyed up with the hope that he should receive assistance from Bussy, who had just expelled the English from their factory at Vizapatam, ordered Meer Jaffier to advance, with fifteen thousand men, to reinforce Rajah Dulab Ram at Plassey.",last negotiation complete more press nabob compel expel dominion press fresh demand unfortunate prince drive despair buoy hope receive assistance expel factory order advance man reinforce 
24,"Clive, in fact, forced on hostilities. His presence, with that of a considerable portion of his army, was urgently required at Madras. He was sure, however, that the instant he had gone, and the English force was greatly weakened, the nabob would again commence hostilities; and the belief was shared by all in India. He was, therefore, determined to force on the crisis, as soon as possible; in order that, the nabob being disposed of, he should be able to send reinforcements to Madras.",fact force hostility presence considerable portion army require sure instant go english force weaken nabob commence hostility belief share determined force crisis possible order nabob dispose able send reinforcement 
25,"While these negotiations had been going on, Charlie Marryat had remained in Calcutta. He had been severely wounded in the attack on Chandranagore, and was carried down to Calcutta in a boat. On arriving there, he heard that the Lizzie Anderson had just cast anchor off the fort. He caused himself at once to be conveyed on board, and was received with the greatest heartiness and pleasure, by his old friend, the captain; and assiduously attended by the doctor of the ship. In order that he might have as much air as possible, the captain had a sort of tent, with a double covering, erected on deck. During the daytime the sides of this were lifted, so that the air could pass freely across the bed.",negotiation go remain wound attack carry boat arrive hear cast anchor fort cause convey board receive great heartiness pleasure old friend captain attend doctor ship order have much air possible captain have sort tent double covering erect deck daytime side lift air pass bed 
26,"Charlie's wound was a severe one and, had he been nursed in a hospital on shore, it is probable that it would have been fatal. Thanks, however, to the comforts on board ship, the freshness and coolness of the situation, and the care of all surrounding him, he was, after some weeks' illness, pronounced convalescent; and was sufficiently recovered to join the force with which Clive marched against Plassey.",wound severe one nurse hospital shore probable fatal thanks comfort board ship freshness coolness situation care surround week illness pronounce convalescent recover join force march 
27,"This force consisted of nine hundred and fifty European infantry, a hundred artillerymen, fifty sailors, and two thousand one hundred Sepoys. The artillery consisted of eight six-pounders and two small howitzers. The army of the nabob was fifty thousand strong, and against such a force it was, indeed, an adventurous task for an army of three thousand men, of whom only one-third were Europeans, to advance to the attack. Everything depended, in fact, upon Meer Jaffier and his two colleagues in treachery, Rajah Dulab Ram and Yar Lutf Khan.",force consist european infantry artillerymen sailor sepoy artillery consist pounder small howitzer army nabob strong force adventurous task army man third advance attack depend fact colleague treachery 
28,"The nabob, on hearing of Clive's advance, had sent to Monsieur Law; who was, with a hundred and fifty men, at a place over a hundred miles distant; to which he had, in accordance with the orders of Clive, been obliged to retire; and begged him to advance to join him, with all speed. The nabob had with him forty or fifty Frenchmen, commanded by Monsieur Saint Frais, formerly one of the council of Chandranagore. These had some field pieces of their own, and also directed the native artillery, of fifty-three guns; principally thirty-two, twenty-four, and eighteen pounders.",nabob hearing advance send man place mile distant accordance order oblige retire begg advance join speed nabob have command council have field piece own direct native artillery gun pounder 
29,"Had Clive been sure of the cooperation of Meer Jaffier and his confederates, who commanded three out of the four divisions of the nabob's army, he need not have hesitated. But he was, till the last moment, in ignorance whether to rely upon them. The nabob, having become suspicious of Meer Jaffier, had obtained from him an oath, sworn on the Koran, of fidelity; and although the traitor continued his correspondence with Clive, his letters were of a very dubious character, and Clive was in total ignorance as to his real intentions. So doubtful, indeed, was he that, when only a few miles of ground and the river Bhagirathi lay between him and the enemy, Clive felt the position so serious that he called a council of war; and put to them the question whether they should attack the nabob, or fortify themselves at Katwa, and hold that place until the rainy season, which had just set in with great violence, should abate.",sure cooperation confederate command division nabob army hesitate last moment ignorance rely nabob become suspicious obtain oath swear fidelity traitor continue correspondence letter dubious character total ignorance real intention doubtful few mile ground river lay enemy feel position serious call council war put question attack nabob fortify hold place rainy season set great violence abate 
30,"All the officers above the rank of subalterns, twenty in number, were present. Clive himself, contrary to custom, gave his vote first in favour of halting at Katwa. Major Kilpatrick, who commanded the Company's troops, Major Grant of the 37th, and ten other officers voted the same way. Major Eyre Coote declared in favour of an immediate advance. He argued that the troops were in high spirits, and had hitherto been everywhere successful, and that a delay would allow Monsieur Law and his troops to arrive. He considered that, if they determined not to fight, they should fall back upon Calcutta. Charlie Marryat supported him, as did five other officers, all belonging to the Indian service.",officer rank subaltern number present contrary custom give vote favour halt command troops major 37th other officer vote same way declare favour immediate advance argue troops high spirit successful delay allow troops arrive consider determine fight fall support do other officer belong indian service 
31,"The decision taken, the council separated, and Clive strolled away to a grove, and sat down by himself. There he thought over, in his mind, the arguments which had been advanced by both sides. He saw the force of the arguments which had been adduced by Major Eyre Coote and Charlie Marryat; and his own experience showed him that the daring course is always the most prudent one, in fighting Asiatics. At last, he came to a conclusion. Rising, he returned to the camp; and, meeting Major Coote on the way, informed him that he had changed his mind, and would fight the next day.",decision take council separate stroll grove sit think mind argument advance side see force argument adduce own experience show dare course prudent one fight last come conclusion rising return camp meet way inform change mind fight next day 
32,"Charlie returned to his tent after the council broke up, disheartened at the result. He was greeted by Tim.",return tent council break dishearten result greet 
33,"""Shure, yer honor, Hossein is in despair. The water has filled up the holes, where he makes his fires, and the rain has soaked the wood. Yer dinner is not near cooked yet, and half the dishes are spoilt.""",honor despair water fill hole make fire rain soak wood dinner cook dish spoil

35,"""We are going to fight them tomorrow, yer honor, I hope,"" Tim said. ""It's sick to death I am of wading about here in the wet, like a duck.

38,"""I think we could, Tim,"" Charlie replied; ""but the odds of fifty-three heavy cannon, which the spies say they've got, to our ten popguns, is serious. However, I'm sorry we're not going to fight, and I'm afraid that you must make up your mind to the wet, and Hossein his to giving me bad dinners for some weeks to come; that is to say, if the enemy don't turn us out of this.""",think reply odd heavy spy say get popgun serious sorry go fight afraid make mind wet give bad dinner week come say enemy turn 
39,"A few minutes later, Lieutenant Peters entered the tent.",few minute enter tent 
40,"""Is it true, Charlie, that we are not going to fight, after all?""",true go fight 
41,"""True enough,"" Charlie said. ""We are to wait till the rains are over.""",true say wait rain 
42,"""Rains!"" Peters said, in disgust; ""what have the rains got to do with it? If we had a six weeks' march before us, I could understand the wet weather being a hindrance. Men are not water rats, and to march all day in these heavy downpours, and to lie all night in the mud, would soon tell upon our strength. But here we are, within a day's march of the enemy, and the men might as well get wet in the field as here. Everyone longs to be at the enemy, and a halt will have a very bad effect.",rain say disgust rain get do have week march understand wet weather hindrance man water rat march day heavy downpour lie night mud tell strength day march enemy man get wet field long enemy halt have bad effect 
43,"""What have you got to drink, Charlie?""",get drink

45,"""Yes, half an hour ago.""",hour 
46,"Just as Charlie finished his meal, Major Eyre Coote put his head into the tent.",finish meal put head tent

50,"Several other officers afterwards dropped into the tent, for the news rapidly spread through the camp. There was, as had been the case at the council, considerable differences of opinion as to the prudence of the measure; but among the junior officers and men, the news that the enemy were to be attacked, at once, was received with hearty satisfaction.",several other officer drop tent news spread camp be case council considerable difference opinion prudence measure junior officer man news enemy attack receive hearty satisfaction 
51,"""Here, major,"" a fellow subaltern of Peters' said, as he entered the tent, followed by a servant; ""I have brought in half a dozen bottles of champagne. I started with a dozen from Calcutta, and had intended to keep these to celebrate our victory. But as, in the first place, all heavy baggage is to be left here; and in the second, it has occurred to me that possibly I may not come back to help to drink it; we may as well turn it to the good purpose of drinking success to the expedition.""",major fellow subaltern say enter tent follow servant bring bottle champagne start intend keep celebrate victory first place heavy baggage leave second occur come help drink turn good purpose drink success expedition 
52,"Some of the bottles were opened, and a merry evening was spent; but the party broke up early, for they had a heavy day's work before them, on the morrow.",bottle open merry evening spend party break have heavy day work morrow 
53,"At daybreak, the troops were in movement towards the banks of the Bhagirathi. They had brought boats with them from Chandranagore, and the work of crossing the river continued, without intermission, until four in the afternoon, when the whole force was landed on the left bank. Here Clive received another letter from Meer Jaffier, informing him that the nabob had halted at Mankarah, and intended to entrench himself there. He suggested that the English should undertake a circuitous march, and attack him in the rear; but as this march would have exposed Clive to being cut off from his communications, and as he was still very doubtful of the good faith of the conspirators, he determined to march straight forward; and sent word to Meer Jaffier, to that effect.",daybreak troops movement bank bring boat work cross river continue intermission afternoon whole force land left bank receive letter inform nabob halt intend entrench suggest undertake circuitous march attack rear march expose cut communication doubtful good faith conspirator determine march send word effect 
54,"From the point where Clive had crossed the Bhagirathi it was fifteen miles to Plassey, following, as they did, the curves of the river. It was necessary to do this, as they had no carriage; and the men were obliged to tow their supplies in boats, against the stream.",point cross mile follow curve river necessary do have carriage man oblige tow supplies boat stream 
55,"Orders were issued that, as soon as the troops were across, they should prepare to eat their dinners, as the march was to be resumed at once. The rain was coming down in a steady pour as the troops, drenched to the skin, started upon their march. The stream, swollen by the rains, was in full flood, and the work of towing the heavy-laden barges was wearisome in the extreme. All took a share in the toil. In many cases the river had overflowed its banks, and the troops had to struggle through the water, up to their waists, while they tugged and strained at the ropes.",order issue troops prepare eat dinner march resume rain come steady pour troops drench skin start march stream swollen rain full flood work towing heavy laden barge wearisome extreme take share toil many case river overflow bank troops have struggle water waist tug strain rope 
56,"Charlie, as a mounted officer, rode at the head of his Sepoys; who formed the advance of the force. Three hundred men preceded the main body, who were towing the boats, to guard them from any sudden surprise. Tim marched beside him, occasionally falling back, and taking a turn at the ropes.",mount officer ride head form advance force man precede main body towing boat guard sudden surprise march fall take turn rope
