3,"We now seated ourselves upon a rock and began to examine into our personal property.  When we reached the shore, after being wrecked, my companions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in the sun to dry, for, although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not a single cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part of my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our garments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid their contents out on a flat stone before us; and, now that our minds were fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we turned our several pockets inside out, in order that nothing might escape us.  When all was collected together we found that our worldly goods consisted of the following articles:--",seat rock begin examine personal property reach shore wreck companion take part clothes spread sun dry gale rage be single cloud bright sky stripp most part wet clothes spread rock resume garment search pocket utmost care lay content flat stone mind alive condition little anxiety turn several pocket order escape collect find worldly goods consist follow article 
4,"First, A small penknife with a single blade broken off about the middle and very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge. (Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for a saw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, An old German-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, A piece of whip- cord about six yards long.  Fourth, A sailmaker's needle of a small size. Fifth, A ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I was in the water.  Indeed it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of my grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand why I kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning man will clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were wrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now, although we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass ring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood why he wore it, for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not seem to care for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said ""it was in memory of the girl he left behind him!""  But as he never spoke of this girl to either of us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either jesting or mistaken.  In addition to these articles we had a little bit of tinder, and the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:--",small penknife single blade break middle rusty have notche edge say usual pleasantry do saw knife great advantage old german silver pencil case lead piece whip cord yard long sailmaker needle small size fifth ship telescope happen have hand time ship strike cling time water difficulty get grasp lie insensible shore understand keep firm hold telescope say drown man clutch straw such feeling know hand time wreck feel pleasure have see much use glass small end break piece sixth article brass ring wear little finger understand wear vain appearance seem care ornament kind say memory girl leave speak girl inclined think jest mistaken addition article have little bit tinder clothes back last follow 
5,"Each of us had on a pair of stout canvass trousers, and a pair of sailors' thick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red Kilmarnock bonnet or night-cap, besides a pair of worsted socks, and a cotton pocket-handkerchief, with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson printed on it, and a union Jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped flannel shirt,--which he wore outside his trousers, and belted round his waist, after the manner of a tunic,--and a round black straw hat.  He had no jacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved to be extremely mild; so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred to go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white cotton socks, and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black cap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvass trousers already mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had nothing else; but, when we thought of the danger from which we had escaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on the reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were possessed of so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that we had had a little more.",have pair stout canvass trousers pair sailor thick shoe wear red flannel shirt blue jacket red bonnet night cap pair worsted sock cotton pocket handkerchief portrait print union middle have stripe flannel shirt wear trousers belt waist manner tunic round black straw hat have jacket throw cast sea much consequence climate island prove mild much prefer go jacket have pair white cotton sock blue handkerchief white spot own costume consist blue flannel shirt blue jacket black cap pair worsted sock shoe canvass trousers mention have thing have else think danger escape bad have ship strike reef night feel thankful possess much confess wish have little more 
6,"While we were examining these things, and talking about them, Jack suddenly started and exclaimed--",examine thing talk start exclaim 
7,"""The oar! we have forgotten the oar.""",oar forget oar 
8,"""What good will that do us?"" said Peterkin; ""there's wood enough on the island to make a thousand oars.""",good do say be wood island make oar 
9,"""Ay, lad,"" replied Jack, ""but there's a bit of hoop iron at the end of it, and that may be of much use to us.""",reply be bit hoop iron end much use 
10,"""Very true,"" said I, ""let us go fetch it;"" and with that we all three rose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from loss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but Jack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good nature, turned back to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well about me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered with thick bushes which almost hid the country from our view.  As we now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I cast my eyes about, and, truly, my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale had suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that. The island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes, and shrubs, none of which I knew the names of at that time, except, indeed, the cocoa- nut palms, which I recognised at once from the many pictures that I had seen of them before I left home.  A sandy beach of dazzling whiteness lined this bright green shore, and upon it there fell a gentle ripple of the sea.  This last astonished me much, for I recollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows on the shore long after a storm had subsided.  But on casting my glance out to sea the cause became apparent. About a mile distant from the shore I saw the great billows of the ocean rolling like a green wall, and falling with a long, loud roar, upon a low coral reef, where they were dashed into white foam and flung up in clouds of spray.  This spray sometimes flew exceedingly high, and, every here and there, a beautiful rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling drops.  We afterwards found that this coral reef extended quite round the island, and formed a natural breakwater to it.  Beyond this the sea rose and tossed violently from the effects of the storm; but between the reef and the shore it was as calm and as smooth as a pond.",true say let go fetch rise hasten beach feel little weak loss blood companion begin leave perceive usual considerate good nature turn help first time look land spot lay cover thick bush hide country view emerge walk sandy beach cast eye heart glow spirit rise beautiful prospect beheld side gale die blow dash ship rock have more do accomplish island stand hilly cover beautiful coloured tree bush shrub know name time cocoa nut palm recognise many picture see leave sandy beach dazzling whiteness line bright green shore fall gentle ripple sea last astonished recollect home sea use fall huge billow shore storm subside cast glance sea cause become apparent mile distant shore see great billow ocean roll green wall fall long loud roar low coral reef dash white foam flung cloud spray spray fly high beautiful rainbow form moment falling drop find coral reef extend island form natural breakwater sea rise toss effect storm reef shore calm smooth pond 
11,"My heart was filled with more delight than I can express at sight of so many glorious objects, and my thoughts turned suddenly to the contemplation of the Creator of them all.  I mention this the more gladly, because at that time, I am ashamed to say, I very seldom thought of my Creator, although I was constantly surrounded by the most beautiful and wonderful of His works.  I observed from the expression of my companion's countenance that he too derived much joy from the splendid scenery, which was all the more agreeable to us after our long voyage on the salt sea.  There, the breeze was fresh and cold, but here it was delightfully mild; and, when a puff blew off the land, it came laden with the most exquisite perfume that can be imagined.  While we thus gazed, we were startled by a loud ""Huzza!"" from Peterkin, and, on looking towards the edge of the sea, we saw him capering and jumping about like a monkey, and ever and anon tugging with all his might at something that lay upon the shore.",heart fill more delight express sight many glorious object thought turn contemplation mention time ashamed say think surround beautiful wonderful work observe expression companion countenance derive much joy splendid scenery agreeable long voyage salt sea breeze fresh cold mild puff blow land come laden exquisite perfume imagine gaze startle loud look edge sea see caper jump monkey anon tug lay shore 
12,"""What an odd fellow he is, to be sure,"" said Jack, taking me by the arm and hurrying forward; ""come, let us hasten to see what it is.""",odd fellow sure say take arm hurry come let hast see 
13,"""Here it is, boys, hurrah! come along.  Just what we want,"" cried Peterkin, as we drew near, still tugging with all his power.  ""First rate; just the very ticket!""",boy hurrah come want cry draw tug power first rate very ticket 
14,"I need scarcely say to my readers that my companion Peterkin was in the habit of using very remarkable and peculiar phrases.  And I am free to confess that I did not well understand the meaning of some of them,--such, for instance, as ""the very ticket;"" but I think it my duty to recount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard to truthfulness in as far as my memory serves me; so I write, as nearly as possible, the exact words that my companions spoke.  I often asked Peterkin to explain what he meant by ""ticket,"" but he always answered me by going into fits of laughter.  However, by observing the occasions on which he used it, I came to understand that it meant to show that something was remarkably good, or fortunate.",need say reader companion habit use remarkable peculiar phrase free confess understand meaning such instance very ticket think duty recount relate adventure strict regard truthfulness memory serve write possible exact word companion speak ask explain mean ticket answer go fit laughter observe occasion use come understand mean show good fortunate 
15,"On coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to pull the axe out of the oar, into which, it will be remembered, Jack struck it while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among which it had become entangled at the bow of the ship.  Fortunately for us the axe had remained fast in the oar, and even now, all Peterkin's strength could not draw it out of the cut.",come find endeavour pull axe oar remember strike endeavour cut cordage become entangle bow ship axe remain fast oar strength draw cut 
16,"""Ah! that is capital indeed,"" cried Jack, at the same time giving the axe a wrench that plucked it out of the tough wood.  ""How fortunate this is! It will be of more value to us than a hundred knives, and the edge is quite new and sharp.""",capital cry same time give axe wrench pluck tough wood fortunate more value knife edge new sharp 
17,"""I'll answer for the toughness of the handle at any rate,"" cried Peterkin; ""my arms are nearly pulled out of the sockets.  But see here, our luck is great.  There is iron on the blade.""  He pointed to a piece of hoop iron, as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of the oar to prevent it from splitting.",answer toughness handle rate cry arm pull socket see luck great be iron blade point piece hoop iron speak nail blade oar prevent split 
18,"This also was a fortunate discovery.  Jack went down on his knees, and with the edge of the axe began carefully to force out the nails.  But as they were firmly fixed in, and the operation blunted our axe, we carried the oar up with us to the place where we had left the rest of our things, intending to burn the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time.",fortunate discovery go knee edge axe begin force nail fix operation blunt axe carry oar place leave rest thing intend burn wood iron convenient time 
19,"""Now, lads,"" said Jack, after we had laid it on the stone which contained our little all, ""I propose that we should go to the tail of the island, where the ship struck, which is only a quarter of a mile off, and see if anything else has been thrown ashore.  I don't expect anything, but it is well to see.  When we get back here it will be time to have our supper and prepare our beds.""",lad say lay stone contain little propose go tail island ship strike quarter mile see else throw expect well see get time have supper prepare bed 
20,"""Agreed!"" cried Peterkin and I together, as, indeed, we would have agreed to any proposal that Jack made; for, besides his being older and much stronger and taller than either of us, he was a very clever fellow, and I think would have induced people much older than himself to choose him for their leader, especially if they required to be led on a bold enterprise.",agree cry agree proposal make old strong tall clever fellow think induce person old choose leader require lead bold enterprise 
21,"Now, as we hastened along the white beach, which shone so brightly in the rays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite dazzled by its glare, it suddenly came into Peterkin's head that we had nothing to eat except the wild berries which grew in profusion at our feet.",hasten white beach shine ray setting sun eye dazzle glare come head have eat wild berries grow profusion foot 
22,"""What shall we do, Jack?"" said he, with a rueful look; ""perhaps they may be poisonous!""",do say rueful look poisonous 
23,"""No fear,"" replied Jack, confidently; ""I have observed that a few of them are not unlike some of the berries that grow wild on our own native hills.  Besides, I saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few minutes ago, and what won't kill the birds won't kill us.  But look up there, Peterkin,"" continued Jack, pointing to the branched head of a cocoa-nut palm.  ""There are nuts for us in all stages.""",fear reply observe few berries grow wild own native hill see strange bird eat few minute kill bird kill look continue point branch head cocoa nut palm be nut stage 
24,"""So there are!"" cried Peterkin, who being of a very unobservant nature had been too much taken up with other things to notice anything so high above his head as the fruit of a palm tree.  But, whatever faults my young comrade had, he could not be blamed for want of activity or animal spirits.  Indeed, the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he bounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel, and, in a few minutes, returned with three nuts, each as large as a man's fist.",be cry unobservant nature take other thing notice high head fruit palm tree fault young comrade have blame want activity animal spirit nut point bound tall stem tree squirrel few minute return nut large man fist 
25,"""You had better keep them till we return,"" raid Jack.  ""Let us finish our work before eating.""",good keep return raid let finish work eat 
26,"""So be it, captain, go ahead,"" cried Peterkin, thrusting the nuts into his trousers pocket.  ""In fact I don't want to eat just now, but I would give a good deal for a drink.  Oh that I could find a spring! but I don't see the smallest sign of one hereabouts.  I say, Jack, how does it happen that you seem to be up to everything?  You have told us the names of half- a-dozen trees already, and yet you say that you were never in the South Seas before.""",captain go cry thrust nut trousers pocket fact want eat give good deal drink find spring see small sign hereabout say happen seem tell name half tree say 
27,"""I'm not up to _everything_, Peterkin, as you'll find out ere long,"" replied Jack, with a smile; ""but I have been a great reader of books of travel and adventure all my life, and that has put me up to a good many things that you are, perhaps, not acquainted with.""",find reply smile great reader book travel adventure life put good many thing acquainted 
28,"""Oh, Jack, that's all humbug.  If you begin to lay everything to the credit of books, I'll quite lose my opinion of you,"" cried Peterkin, with a look of contempt.  ""I've seen a lot o' fellows that were _always_ poring over books, and when they came to try to _do_ anything, they were no better than baboons!""",humbug begin lay credit book lose opinion cry look contempt see lot o' fellow _always_ pore book come try _do_ good baboon 
29,"""You are quite right,"" retorted Jack; ""and I have seen a lot of fellows who never looked into books at all, who knew nothing about anything except the things they had actually seen, and very little they knew even about these.  Indeed, some were so ignorant that they did not know that cocoa-nuts grew on cocoa-nut trees!""",right retort see lot fellow look book know thing see little know ignorant know cocoa nut grow cocoa nut tree 
30,"I could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke, for there was much truth in it, as to Peterkin's ignorance.",refrain laugh rebuke be much truth ignorance

32,"""Neither would I,"" said Jack; ""but that's no reason why you should run books down, or think less of me for having read them.  Suppose, now, Peterkin, that you wanted to build a ship, and I were to give you a long and particular account of the way to do it, would not that be very useful?""",say reason run book think less read suppose want build ship give long particular account way do useful

35,"""Well--no, perhaps not.""",

37,"""Oh, bother! Jack, you're a philosopher, and that's worse than anything!"" cried Peterkin, with a look of pretended horror.",bother philosopher bad cry look pretend horror 
38,"""Very well, Peterkin, we shall see,"" returned Jack, halting under the shade of a cocoa-nut tree.  ""You said you were thirsty just a minute ago; now, jump up that tree and bring down a nut,--not a ripe one, bring a green, unripe one.""",see return halt shade cocoa nut tree say thirsty minute jump tree bring nut ripe one bring green unripe one 
39,"Peterkin looked surprised, but, seeing that Jack was in earnest, he obeyed.",look surprise see earnest obey 
40,"""Now, cut a hole in it with your penknife, and clap it to your mouth, old fellow,"" said Jack.",cut hole penknife clap mouth old fellow say 
41,"Peterkin did as he was directed, and we both burst into uncontrollable laughter at the changes that instantly passed over his expressive countenance.  No sooner had he put the nut to his mouth, and thrown back his head in order to catch what came out of it, than his eyes opened to twice their ordinary size with astonishment, while his throat moved vigorously in the act of swallowing.  Then a smile and look of intense delight overspread his face, except, indeed, the mouth, which, being firmly fixed to the hole in the nut, could not take part in the expression; but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at us excessively with his right eye.  At length he stopped, and, drawing a long breath, exclaimed--",direct burst uncontrollable laughter change pass expressive countenance put nut mouth throw head order catch come eye open ordinary size astonishment throat move act swallow smile look intense delight overspread face mouth fix hole nut take part expression endeavour make wink right eye length stop draw long breath exclaim 
42,"""Nectar! perfect nectar!  I say, Jack, you're a Briton--the best fellow I ever met in my life.  Only taste that!"" said he, turning to me and holding the nut to my mouth.  I immediately drank, and certainly I was much surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my throat.  It was extremely cool, and had a sweet taste, mingled with acid; in fact, it was the likest thing to lemonade I ever tasted, and was most grateful and refreshing.  I handed the nut to Jack, who, after tasting it, said, ""Now, Peterkin, you unbeliever, I never saw or tasted a cocoa nut in my life before, except those sold in shops at home; but I once read that the green nuts contain that stuff, and you see it is true!""",nectar perfect nectar say good fellow meet life taste say turn hold nut mouth drink surprise delightful liquid flow throat cool have sweet taste mingle acid fact likest thing lemonade taste grateful refresh hand nut taste say unbeliever see taste cocoa nut life sell shop home read green nut contain stuff see true

44,"""A hollow kernel,"" answered Jack, ""with a liquid like milk in it; but it does not satisfy thirst so well as hunger.  It is very wholesome food I believe.""",hollow kernel answer liquid milk satisfy thirst hunger wholesome food believe 
45,"""Meat and drink on the same tree!"" cried Peterkin; ""washing in the sea, lodging on the ground,--and all for nothing!  My dear boys, we're set up for life; it must be the ancient Paradise,--hurrah!"" and Peterkin tossed his straw hat in the air, and ran along the beach hallooing like a madman with delight.",meat drink same tree cry wash sea lodging ground dear boy set life ancient hurrah toss straw hat air run beach halloo madman delight 
46,"We afterwards found, however, that these lovely islands were very unlike Paradise in many things.  But more of this in its proper place.",find lovely island many thing more proper place 
47,"We had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had struck, but did not find a single article, although we searched carefully among the coral rocks, which at this place jutted out so far as nearly to join the reef that encircled the island.  Just as we were about to return, however, we saw something black floating in a little cove that had escaped our observation.  Running forward, we drew it from the water, and found it to be a long thick leather boot, such as fishermen at home wear; and a few paces farther on we picked up its fellow.  We at once recognised these as having belonged to our captain, for he had worn them during the whole of the storm, in order to guard his legs from the waves and spray that constantly washed over our decks.  My first thought on seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack soon put my mind more at rest on that point, by saying that if the captain had been drowned with the boots on, he would certainly have been washed ashore along with them, and that he had no doubt whatever he had kicked them off while in the sea, that he might swim more easily.",come point rock ship strike find single article search coral rock place jutt join reef encircle island about return see black float little cove escape observation runn draw water find long thick leather boot such fisherman home wear few pace pick fellow recognise belong captain wear whole storm order guard leg wave spray wash deck first thought see dear captain drown put mind more rest point say captain drown boot wash have doubt kick sea swim 
48,"Peterkin immediately put them on, but they were so large that, as Jack said, they would have done for boots, trousers, and vest too.  I also tried them, but, although I was long enough in the legs for them, they were much too large in the feet for me; so we handed them to Jack, who was anxious to make me keep them, but as they fitted his large limbs and feet as if they had been made for him, I would not hear of it, so he consented at last to use them.  I may remark, however, that Jack did not use them often, as they were extremely heavy.",put large say do boot trousers vest try long leg large foot hand anxious make keep fit large limb foot make hear consent last use remark use heavy 
49,"It was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our encampment; so we put off our visit to the top of a hill till next day, and employed the light that yet remained to us in cutting down a quantity of boughs and the broad leaves of a tree, of which none of us knew the name.  With these we erected a sort of rustic bower, in which we meant to pass the night.  There was no absolute necessity for this, because the air of our island was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite well without any shelter; but we were so little used to sleeping in the open air, that we did not quite relish the idea of lying down without any covering over us: besides, our bower would shelter us from the night dews or rain, if any should happen to fall.  Having strewed the floor with leaves and dry grass, we bethought ourselves of supper.",begin grow dark return encampment put visit top hill next day employ light remain cut quantity bough broad leave tree know name erect sort rustic bower mean pass night be absolute necessity air island genial balmy sleep shelter little use sleep open air relish idea lie cover bower shelter night dew rain happen fall strew floor leave dry grass bethough supper

52,"""There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach,"" said he, ""but they are of no use at all without a steel.  However, we must try.""  So saying, he went to the beach, and soon returned with two flints.  On one of these he placed the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; but it was with great difficulty that a very small spark was struck out of the flints, and the tinder, being a bad, hard piece, would not catch.  He then tried the bit of hoop iron, which would not strike fire at all; and after that the back of the axe, with no better success.  During all these trials Peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets, gazing with a most melancholy visage at our comrade, his face growing longer and more miserable at each successive failure.",be flint beach say use steel try say go beach return flint place tinder endeavour ignite great difficulty small spark strike flint tinder bad hard piece catch try bit hoop iron strike fire back axe good success trial sit hand pocket gaze melancholy visage comrade face grow long miserable successive failure 
53,"""Oh dear!"" he sighed, ""I would not care a button for the cooking of our victuals,--perhaps they don't need it,--but it's so dismal to eat one's supper in the dark, and we have had such a capital day, that it's a pity to finish off in this glum style.

55,Peterkin was silent.  In his sudden recollection of the telescope he had quite overlooked the absence of the sun.,silent sudden recollection telescope overlook absence sun 
56,"""Ah, boys, I've got it now!"" exclaimed Jack, rising and cutting a branch from a neighbouring bush, which be stripped of its leaves.  ""I recollect seeing this done once at home.  Hand me the bit of whip-cord.""  With the cord and branch Jack soon formed a bow.  Then he cut a piece, about three inches long, off the end of a dead branch, which he pointed at the two ends.  Round this he passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end against his chest, which was protected from its point by a chip of wood; the other point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to saw vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill while boring a hole in a piece of iron.  In a few seconds the tinder began to smoke; in less than a minute it caught fire; and in less than a quarter of an hour we were drinking our lemonade and eating cocoa nuts round a fire that would have roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke, flames, and sparks, flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging palm trees, and cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.",boy get exclaim rise cut branch neighbour bush stripp leave recollect see do home hand bit whip cord cord branch form bow cut piece inch long end dead branch point end pass cord bow place end chest protect point chip wood other point place bit tinder begin see bow blacksmith do drill boring hole piece iron few second tinder begin smoke less minute catch fire less quarter hour drink lemonade eat cocoa nut fire roast entire sheep smoke flame spark fly broad leave overhang palm tree cast warm glow leafy bower
