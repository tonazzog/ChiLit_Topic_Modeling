4," The old hound went straight through the town, smelling Clink's footsteps, till he came into a large field of barley; and there, sitting against a sheaf, for it was harvest time, they found Clink-of-the-Hole. He was a very ugly little brown man, and he was smoking a pipe in the shade; while crouched near him was the poor little woman, with her hands spread before her face.",old hound go town smell footstep come large field barley sit sheaf harvest time find hole ugly little brown man smoke pipe shade crouch poor little woman hand spread face

14,"""Oh, it was given me,"" said Jack, carelessly.",give say 
15,"Clink looked hard at the shilling, and so did the fairy woman, and Jack let them look some time, for he amused himself with throwing it up several times and catching it. At last he put it back in his pocket, and then Clink heaved a deep sigh. Then Jack took out a penny, and began to toss that up, upon which, to his great surprise, the little brown man fell on his knees, and said, ""Oh, a shilling and a penny,--a shilling and a penny of mortal coin!

28,"""Can I buy you with this?"" said he; and the fairy woman answered, ""Yes.""",buy say fairy woman answer

30,"""Shall she be my slave forever, and not yours,"" said Jack, ""if I give you this?""",slave say give 
31,"""She shall,"" said the brown man. And he made such a low bow, as he took the money, that his head actually knocked the ground. Then he jumped up; and, as if he was afraid Jack should repent of his bargain, he ran off towards the hole in the hill with all his might, shouting for joy as he went.",say brown man make low bow take money head knock ground jump afraid repent bargain run hole hill shouting joy go 
32,"""Slave,"" said Jack, ""that is a very ragged old apron that you have got, and your gown is quite worn out. Don't you think we had better spend my shilling in buying you some new clothes? You look so very shabby.""",slave say ragged old apron get gown wear think have spend shilling buy new clothes look shabby

36,"""What!"" said Jack; ""can you go all the way back into the town again? I think you must be tired, for you know you are so very old.""",say go way town think tired know old 
37,"The fairy woman laughed when Jack said this, and she had such a sweet laugh that he loved to hear it; but she took the shilling, and trudged off to the town, and he went back to the boat, his hound running after him.",fairy woman laugh say have sweet laugh love hear take shilling trudge town go boat hound run 
38,"He was a long time going, for he ran a good many times after butterflies, and then he climbed up several trees; and altogether he amused himself for such a long while that when he reached the boat his fairy woman was there before him. So he stepped on board, the hound followed, and the boat immediately began to swim on.",long time go run good many time butterfly climb several tree amuse long while reach boat fairy woman step board hound follow boat begin swim 
39,"""Why, you have not bought any new clothes!"" said Jack to his slave.",buy new clothes say slave 
40,"""No, master,"" answered the fairy woman; ""but I have bought what I wanted."" And she took out of her pocket a little tiny piece of purple ribbon, with a gold-colored satin edge, and a very small tortoise-shell comb.",master answer fairy woman buy want take pocket little tiny piece purple ribbon gold color satin edge small tortoise shell comb 
41,"When Jack saw these he was vexed, and said, ""What do you mean by being so silly? I can't scold you properly, because I don't know what name to call you by, and I don't like to say 'Slave,' because that sounds so rude. Why, this bit of ribbon is such a little bit that it's of no use at all. It's not large enough even to make one mitten of.""",see vex say mean silly scold know name call like say slave sound rude bit ribbon little bit use large make mitten 
42,"""Isn't it?"" said the slave. ""Just take hold of it, master, and let us see if it will stretch.""",say slave take hold master let see stretch 
43,"So Jack did. And she pulled, and he pulled, and very soon the silk had stretched till it was nearly as large as a handkerchief; and then she shook it, and they pulled again. ""This is very good fun,"" said Jack; ""why now it is as large as an apron.""",pull pull silk stretch large handkerchief shake pull good fun say large apron 
44,"So she shook it again, and gave it a twitch here and a pat there; and then they pulled again, and the silk suddenly stretched so wide that Jack was very nearly falling overboard. So Jack's slave pulled off her ragged gown and apron, and put it on. It was a most beautiful robe of purple silk; it had a gold border, and it just fitted her.",shake give twitch pat pull silk stretch wide fall slave pull ragged gown apron put beautiful robe purple silk have gold border fit

46,"""These are fairies,"" said Jack's slave; ""but what are you?""--PAGE 99.]",fairy say slave page 
47,"""That will do,"" she said. And then she took out the little tortoise-shell comb, pulled off her cap, and threw it into the river. She had a little knot of soft, gray hair, and she let it down, and began to comb. And as she combed the hair got much longer and thicker, till it fell in waves all about her throat. Then she combed again, and it all turned gold-color, and came tumbling down to her waist; and then she stood up in the boat, and combed once more, and shook out the hair, and there was such a quantity that it reached down to her feet, and she was so covered with it that you could not see one bit of her, excepting her eyes, which peeped out, and looked bright and full of tears.",do say take little tortoise shell comb pull cap throw river have little knot soft gray hair let begin comb comb hair get long thick fall wave throat comb turn gold color come tumble waist stand boat comb more shake hair be quantity reach foot cover see bit except eye peep look bright full tear 
48,"Then she began to gather up her lovely locks; and when she had dried her eyes with them, she said, ""Master, do you know what you have done? look at me now!"" So she threw back the hair from her face, and it was a beautiful young face; and she looked so happy that Jack was glad he had bought her with his half-crown,--so glad that he could not help crying, and the fair slave cried too; and then instantly the little fairies woke, and sprang out of Jack's pockets. As they did so, Jovinian cried out, ""Madam, I am your most humble servant""; and Roxaletta said, ""I hope your Grace is well""; but the third got on Jack's knee, and took hold of the buttons of his waistcoat, and when the lovely slave looked at her, she hid her face and blushed with pretty childish shyness.",begin gather lovely lock dry eye say master know do look throw hair face beautiful young face look happy glad buy half crown glad help cry fair slave cry little fairy wake spring pocket do cry humble servant say hope well third get knee take hold button waistcoat lovely slave look hide face blush childish shyness 
49,"""These are fairies,"" said Jack's slave; ""but what are you?""",fairy say slave 
50,"""Jack kissed me,"" said the little thing; ""and I want to sit on his knee.""",kiss say little thing want sit knee 
51,"""Yes,"" said Jack; ""I took them out, and laid them in a row, to see that they were safe, and this one I kissed, because she looked such a little dear.""",say take lay row see safe one kiss look little dear 
52,"""Was she not like the others, then?"" asked the slave.",other ask slave 
53,"""Yes,"" said Jack; ""but I liked her the best; she was my favorite.""",say like good favorite 
54,"Now, the instant these three fairies sprang out of Jack's pockets, they got very much larger; in fact, they became fully grown,--that is to say, they measured exactly one foot one inch in height, which, as most people know, is exactly the proper height for fairies of that tribe. The two who had sprung out first were very beautifully dressed. One had a green velvet coat, and a sword, the hilt of which was incrusted with diamonds. The second had a white spangled robe, and the loveliest rubies and emeralds round her neck and in her hair; but the third, the one who sat on Jack's knee, had a white frock and a blue sash on. She had soft, fat arms, and a face just like that of a sweet little child.",instant fairy spring pocket get large fact become grow say measure foot inch height most person know proper height fairy tribe spring dress have green velvet coat sword hilt incrust diamond second have white spangled robe loveliest ruby emerald neck hair third one sit knee have white frock blue sash have soft fat arm face sweet little child 
55,"When Jack's slave saw this, she took the little creature on her knee, and said to her, ""How comes it that you are not like your companions?""",slave see take little creature knee say come companion 
56,"And she answered, in a pretty lisping voice, ""It's because Jack kissed me.""",answer lisping voice kiss 
57,"""Even so it must be,"" answered the slave; ""the love of a mortal works changes indeed. It is not often that we win anything so precious. Here, master, let her sit on your knee sometimes, and take care of her, for she cannot now take the same care of herself that others of her race are capable of.""",answer slave love mortal work change win precious master let sit knee take care take same care other race capable 
58,"So Jack let little Mopsa sit on his knee; and when he was tired of admiring his slave, and wondering at the respect with which the other two fairies treated her, and at their cleverness in getting water-lilies for her, and fanning her with feathers, he curled himself up in the bottom of the boat with his own little favorite, and taught her how to play at cat's-cradle.",let little sit knee tired admire slave wonder respect other fairy treat cleverness get water lilie fann feather curl bottom boat own little favorite teach play cat cradle 
59,"When they had been playing some time, and Mopsa was getting quite clever at the game, the lovely slave said, ""Master, it is a long time since you spoke to me.""",play time get clever game lovely slave say long time speak 
60,"""And yet,"" said Jack, ""there is something that I particularly want to ask you about.""",say be want ask 
61,"""Ask it then,"" she replied.",ask reply 
62,"""I don't like to have a slave,"" answered Jack; ""and as you are so clever, don't you think you can find out how to be free again?""",like have slave answer clever think find free 
63,"""I am very glad you asked me about that,"" said the fairy woman. ""Yes, master, I wish very much to be free; and as you were so kind as to give the most valuable piece of real money you possessed in order to buy me, I can be free if you can think of anything that you really like better than that half-crown, and if I can give it you.""",glad ask say fairy woman master wish much free kind give valuable piece real money possess order buy free think like good half crown give 
64,"""Oh, there are many things,"" said Jack. ""I like going up this river to Fairyland much better.""",be many thing say like go river good 
65,"""But you are going there, master,"" said the fairy woman; ""you were on the way before I met with you.""",go master say fairy woman way meet 
66,"""I like this little child better,"" said Jack; ""I love this little Mopsa. I should like her to belong to me.""",like little child good say love little like belong 
67,"""She is yours,"" answered the fairy woman; ""she belongs to you already. Think of something else.""",answer fairy woman belong think else 
68,"Jack thought again, and was so long about it that at last the beautiful slave said to him, ""Master, do you see those purple mountains?""",think long last beautiful slave say see purple mountain 
69,"Jack turned round in the boat, and saw a splendid range of purple mountains, going up and up. They were very great and steep, each had a crown of snow, and the sky was very red behind them, for the sun was going down.",turn boat see splendid range purple mountain go great steep have crown snow sky red sun go 
70,"""At the other side of those mountains is Fairyland,"" said the slave; ""but if you cannot think of something that you should like better to have than your half-crown, I can never enter in. The river flows straight up to yonder steep precipice, and there is a chasm in it which pierces it, and through which the river runs down beneath, among the very roots of the mountains, till it comes out at the other side. Thousands and thousands of the small people will come when they see the boat, each with a silken thread in his hand; but if there is a slave in it, not all their strength and skill can tow it through. Look at those rafts on the river; on them are the small people coming up.""",other side mountain say slave think like good have half crown enter river flow yonder steep precipice be chasm pierce river run very root mountain come other side thousand thousand small person come see boat silken thread hand be slave strength skill tow look raft river small person come 
71,"Jack looked, and saw that the river was spotted with rafts, on which were crowded brown fairy sailors, each one with three green stripes on his sleeve, which looked like good conduct marks. All these sailors were chattering very fast, and the rafts were coming down to meet the boat.",look see river spot raft crowd brown fairy sailor one green stripe sleeve look good conduct mark sailor chatter raft come meet boat 
72,"""All these sailors to tow my slave!"" said Jack. ""I wonder, I do wonder, what you are?"" But the fairy woman only smiled, and Jack went on: ""I have thought of something that I should like much better than my half-crown. I should like to have a little tiny bit of that purple gown of yours with the gold border.""",sailor tow slave say wonder wonder fairy woman smile go think like good half crown like have little tiny bit purple gown gold border 
73,"Then the fairy woman said, ""I thank you, master. Now I can be free."" So she told Jack to lend her his knife, and with it she cut off a very small piece of the skirt of her robe, and gave it to him. ""Now mind,"" she said, ""I advise you never to stretch this unless you want to make some particular thing of it, for then it will only stretch to the right size; but if you merely begin to pull it for your own amusement, it will go on stretching and stretching, and I don't know where it will stop.""",fairy woman say thank master free tell lend knife cut small piece skirt robe give mind say advise stretch want make particular thing stretch right size begin pull own amusement go stretch stretch know stop
