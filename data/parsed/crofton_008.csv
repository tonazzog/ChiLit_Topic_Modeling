1,CHAPTER 8. A LONG DAY.,chapter long day 
2,"Hugh, meantime, was counting the hours till Saturday.  Perhaps, if the truth were known, so was Phil, though he was too old to acknowledge such a longing.  But the climbing about the mill,--the play encouraged there by his uncle and the men,--his uncle's stories within doors, his aunt's good dinners,--the fire-side, the picture-books, the talk of home, altogether made up the greatest treat of the half-year.  Phil had plenty of ways of passing the time.  Hugh began a long letter home,--the very last letter, except the short formal one which should declare when the Christmas vacation should commence.  Hugh meant to write half the letter before Saturday, and then fill it up with an account of his visit to his uncle's.",count hour truth know old acknowledge longing climb mill play encourage uncle man uncle story door aunt good dinner fire side picture book talk home make great treat half year have plenty way pass time begin long letter home last letter short formal one declare vacation commence mean write letter fill account visit uncle 
3,"The days were passed, however, when Hugh had the command of his leisure time, as on his arrival, when his hours were apt to hang heavy.  He had long since become too valuable in the playground to be left to follow his own devices.  As the youngest boy, he was looked upon as a sort of servant to the rest, when once it was found that he was quick and clever.  Either as scout, messenger, or in some such capacity, he was continually wanted; and often at times inconvenient to himself.  He then usually remembered what Mr Tooke had told him of his boy, when Tooke was the youngest,--how he bore things--not only being put on the high wall, but being well worked in the service of the older boys.  Usually Hugh was obliging, but he could and did feel cross at times.  He was cross on this Friday,--the day when he was so anxious to write his letter before going to his uncle's.  On Saturday there would be no time. The early mornings were dark now; and after school he should have to wash and dress, and be off to his uncle's.  On Friday then, his paper was ruled, and he had only to run across the playground to borrow Firth's penknife, and then nothing should delay his letter.",day pass have command leisure time arrival hour apt hang heavy become valuable playground leave follow own device young boy look sort servant rest find quick clever scout messenger such capacity want time inconvenient remember tell boy young bear thing put high wall work service old boy oblige feel cross time cross day anxious write letter go uncle be time early morning dark school have wash dress uncle paper rule have run playground borrow penknife delay letter 
4,"In that ran across the playground he was stopped.  He was wanted to collect clean snow for the boys who were bent on finishing their snow-man while it would bind.  He should be let off when he had brought snow enough.  But he knew that by that time his fingers would be too stiff to hold his pen; and he said he did not choose to stop now.  Upon this Lamb launched a snowball in his face.  Hugh grew angry,--or, as his schoolfellows said, insolent.  Some stood between him and the house, to prevent his getting home, while others promised to roll him in the snow till he yielded full submission.  Instead of yielding, Hugh made for the orchard-wall, scrambled up it, and stood for the moment out of the reach of his enemies.  He kicked down such a quantity of snow upon any one who came near, that he held all at bay for some little time.  At last, however, he had disposed of all the snow within his reach, and they were pelting him thickly with snow-balls.  It was not at any time very easy to stand upright, for long together, upon this wall, as the stones which capped it were rounded.  Now, when the coping-stones were slippery after the frost, and Hugh nearly blinded with the shower of snow-balls, he could not keep his footing, and was obliged to sit astride upon the wall.  This brought one foot within reach from below; and though Hugh kicked, and drew up his foot as far and as often as he could, so as not to lose his balance, it was snatched at by many hands.  At last, one hand kept its hold, and plenty more then fastened upon his leg.  They pulled: he clung.  In another moment, down he came, and the large, heavy coping-stone, loosened by the frost, came after him, and fell upon his left foot as he lay.",run playground stop want collect clean snow boy bend finish snow man bind let bring snow know time finger stiff hold pen say choose stop launch snowball face grow angry schoolfellow say insolent stand house prevent get other promise roll snow yield full submission yield make orchard wall scramble stand moment reach enemy kick quantity snow one come hold bay little time last dispose snow reach pelt snow ball time easy stand wall stone cap round coping stone slippery frost blind shower snow ball keep footing oblige sit wall bring foot reach kick draw foot lose balance snatch many hand last hand keep hold plenty fasten leg pull cling moment come large heavy coping stone loosen frost come fall left foot lay 
5,"It was a dreadful shriek that he gave.  Mrs Watson heard it in her store-room, and Mr Tooke in his study.  Some labourers felling a tree in a wood, a quarter of a mile off, heard it, and came running to see what could be the matter.  The whole school was in a cluster round the poor boy in a few seconds.  During this time, while several were engaged in lifting away the stone, Tooke stooped over him, and said, with his lips as white as paper,--",dreadful shriek give hear store room study labourer fell tree wood quarter mile hear come run see matter whole school cluster poor boy few second time several engage lift stone stoop say lip white paper

8,"""Don't you tell, and then nobody will know.  Mind you don't!""",tell know mind 
9,"One boy after another turned away from the sight of his foot, when the stone was removed.  Tooke fainted, but, then, so did another boy who had nothing to do with the matter.  Everybody who came up asked who did it; and nobody could answer.  Tooke did not hear; and so many felt themselves concerned, that no one wished that any answer should be given.",boy turn sight foot stone remove faint do boy have do matter come ask do answer hear many feel concerned wish answer give

12,"He must not lie there; but who could touch him?  Firth did; and he was the right person, as he was one of the strongest.  He made two boys pass their handkerchiefs under the leg, and sling it, without touching it; and he lifted Hugh, and carried him across his arms towards the house. They met Mr Tooke, and every person belonging to the household, before they reached the door.",lie touch right person strong make boy pass handkerchief leg sling touch lift carry arm house meet person belong household reach door 
13,"""To my bed!"" said the master, when he saw: and in an instant the gardener had his orders to saddle Mr Tooke's horse, and ride to London for an eminent surgeon: stopping by the way to beg Mr and Mrs Shaw to come, and bring with them the surgeon who was their neighbour, Mr Annanby.",bed say master see instant gardener have order saddle horse ride eminent surgeon stop way beg come bring surgeon neighbour

17,"""You will never repent it, my dear boy,"" whispered Firth.  Hugh tried to smile, but he could not help groaning again.  There was a suppressed groan from some one else.  It was from Mr Tooke.  Hugh was sadly afraid he had, by some means, found out who did the mischief.  But it was not so.  Mr Tooke was quite wretched enough without that.",repent dear boy whisper try smile help groan be suppress groan one else afraid means find do mischief wretch 
18,"Everybody was very kind, and did the best that could be done.  Hugh was held up on the side of Mr Tooke's bed, while Mrs Watson took off his clothes, cutting the left side of his trousers to pieces, without any hesitation.  The master held the leg firmly while the undressing went on; and then poor Hugh was laid back, and covered up warm, while the foot was placed on a pillow, with only a light handkerchief thrown over it.",kind do good do hold side bed take clothes cut left side trousers piece hesitation master hold leg undressing go poor lay cover warm foot place pillow light handkerchief throw 
19,"It was terrible to witness his pain; but Mr Tooke never left him all day.

Then Hugh and his uncle were alone.",ask like see uncle aunt come wish see uncle come surgeon do foot present cover say return time meet surgeon expect uncle alone 
32,"Mr Shaw told him how sorry the boys all were, and how they had come in from the playground at once, and put themselves under Firth, to be kept quiet; and that very little dinner had been eaten; and that, when the writing-master arrived, he was quite astonished to find everything so still, and the boys so spiritless: but that nobody told him till he observed how two or three were crying, so that he was sure something was the matter.",tell sorry boy come playground put keep quiet little dinner eat writing master arrive astonished find boy spiritless tell observe cry sure matter

55,"Mr Shaw perceived that Hugh was either in much less pain now, or that he forgot everything in a subject which always interested him extremely. He told his uncle what he had read of the tortures inflicted by savages, till his uncle, already a good deal agitated, was quite sick: but he let him go on, hoping that the boy might think lightly in comparison of what he himself had to undergo.  This could not last long, however.  The wringing pain soon came back; and as Hugh cried, he said he bore it so very badly, he did not know what his mother would say if she saw him.  She had trusted him not to fail; but really he could not bear this much longer.",perceive less pain forget subject interest tell uncle read torture inflict savage uncle good deal agitate sick let go hope boy think comparison have undergo last wringing pain come cry say bear know mother say see trust fail bear

As he sat in a chair, and his uncle stood behind him, and held his hands, and pressed his head against him, Hugh felt how his uncle's breast was heaving,--and was sure he was crying.  In the very middle of it all, Hugh looked up in his uncle's face, and said,--",surgeon take foot sit chair uncle stand hold hand press head feel uncle breast heave sure cry very middle look uncle face say

Every time he opened his eyes, he saw his mother sitting by the fire-side; and every time he moved in the least, she came softly to look.  She would not let him talk at all till near morning, when she found that he could not sleep any more, and that he seemed a little confused about where he was,--what room it was, and how she came to be there by fire-light. Then she lighted a candle, and allowed him to talk about his friend Dale, and several school affairs; and this brought back gradually the recollection of all that had happened.",asleep tea come drink sleep great deal course night wake such odd feeling disturb time open eye see mother sit fire side time move least come look let talk morning find sleep more seem little confused room come fire light light candle allow talk friend several school affair bring recollection happen

86,"And Hugh burst into tears, now more really afflicted than he had been yet.  His mother sat on the bed beside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he told her, as well as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he had reckoned on going round the world, and how little he cared for anything else in the future; and now this was just the very thing he should never be able to do!  He had practised climbing ever since he could remember;--and now that was of no use;--he had practised marching, and now he should never march again.

But the thing he most cared for was the honour of producing a noble work which would outlive him.  Well, at the very beginning of his task, his chisel flew up against his wrist: and the narrow cut that it made,--not more than half an inch wide,--made his right-hand entirely useless for life.  He could never again hold a tool;--his work was gone,--his business in life seemed over,--the support of the whole family was taken away--and the only strong wish Richard Grant had in the world was disappointed.""",remember know tell plan beautiful set carving wood chapel belong nobleman mansion pay work superior able make parent comfortable wife child thing care honour produce noble work outlive very beginning task chisel fly wrist narrow cut make more inch wide make right hand useless life hold tool work gone business life seem support whole family take only strong wish have world disappoint
