1,CHAPTER XVI. “AU REVOIR.”,
2," THE next morning all was excitement at the palace. The news of our return had spread abroad, and in the morning copy of the _Daily Whyer_, which his Majesty found on the breakfast-table when we went down, a full and, I must say, surprisingly accurate account of the interview appeared, together with the information that his Majesty would attend Parliament in state in the afternoon, and that an address from the throne would be read, in which certain changes in the Government would be suggested. There was also a paragraph about A. Fish, Esquire’s, lecture upon the “Unreasonableness of ability,” which the editor advised everybody to try and hear.",next morning excitement palace news return spread morning copy find breakfast table go full say accurate account interview appear information attend state afternoon address throne read certain change government suggest be paragraph lecture unreasonableness ability editor advise try hear

Oh! he’s a character, I can tell you.

While the Crow filled in a few spare moments by interviewing the Pelican. The Creatures stood aside very politely to allow his Majesty and myself to enter, Kis-Smee growling ominously at the Cockatoo, who screamed, “Down with domestic animals,” as he passed.

Moreover, the hall was unaccountably hot and stuffy, and for some time I had the greatest difficulty in keeping awake; and at last my head sank down and I dozed off, awaking at intervals when the Cockatoo was unusually energetic; but at last even her voice was silenced, and I remember no more till I awoke with a start, and found myself, to my great dismay, back again in my own study in London.",remotest idea extraordinary way talk continual interruption animal keep shouting hear hear question withdraw order order etc. kind odd moment hear word say hall hot stuffy time have great difficulty keep awake last head sink doze awake interval energetic last voice silence remember more awoke start find great dismay own study

52,"Olive did not at once answer. Her eyes were fixed on something she saw passing before the window. It was a very, very little man. He was not exactly humpbacked, but his figure was somewhat deformed, and he was so small that but for the sight of his rather wizened old face one could hardly have believed he was a full-grown man. His eyes were bright and beady-looking, like those of a good-natured little weasel, if there be such a thing, and his face lighted up with a smile as he caught sight of the two, to him, strange-looking children at the open window of the little village inn.",answer eye fix see pass window little man humpback figure deform small sight wizened old face believe full grow man eye bright beady look good natured little weasel be thing face light smile catch sight strange look child open window little village inn

Only, of course, their faces were prettier—nice little china faces, rather crumply looking, but quite nice; and then their coats were such a pretty nice blue.

Do you think perhaps somewhere in this country—in those queer dark woods, perhaps—that there are real blue dwarfs, and that somebody must have seen them and made the little china ones like them? Perhaps,” and his voice dropped and grew still more solemn; “_perhaps_, Olive, that little man’s one of them, and they may have to take off their blue coats when they’re walking about.

Don’t you, Olive?”",say awe strike tone think think country queer dark wood be real blue dwarf see make little china one voice drop grow solemn little man have take blue coat walk know think little little frightening 
59,"“No, of course I don’t,” said Olive, and, to do her justice, her rather sharp answer was meant as much to reassure her little brother as to express any feeling of impatience. Rex was quite a little fellow, only eight, and Olive, who was nearly twelve, remembered that when she was as little as that, she used sometimes to feel frightened about things which she now couldn’t see anything the least frightening in. And she remembered how once or twice some of her big cousins had laughed at her, and amused themselves by telling her all sorts of nonsense, which still seemed terrible to her when she was alone in her room in the dark at night. “Of course there’s nothing frightening in it,” she said. “It would be rather a funny idea, I think. Of course it can’t be, you know, Rex. There are no dwarfs, and gnomes, and fairies now.”",course say do justice sharp answer mean much reassure little brother express feeling impatience little fellow remember little use feel frighten thing see least frightening remember big cousin laugh amuse tell sort nonsense seem terrible alone room dark night course be frightening say funny idea think course know be dwarf gnome fairy

Perhaps he had a bad fall when he was a baby—that might stop his growing.”",dwarf fairy sort person explain common little man grow big other person have bad fall baby stop grow

65,"“Well, but,” said Rex, returning to the first subject, “I do think it’s very queer about that little dwarf man coming up the street just as you were telling me about the blue dwarfs.

Why, it’s as big as a house!”",bullock cart say remember queer think first get use see queer thing look top street see load woman carry basket back big house 
68,"He seemed to have forgotten about the dwarfs, and Olive was rather glad of it. These two children were traveling with their uncle and aunt in a rather out-of-the-way part of Germany. Out-of-the-way, that is to say, to most of the regular summer tourists from other countries, who prefer going where they are more sure of finding the comforts and luxuries they are accustomed to at home. But it was by no means out-of-the-way in the sense of being dull or deserted. It is a very busy part of the world indeed. You would be amazed if I were to tell you some of the beautiful things that are made in these bare homely little German cottages. For all about in the neighborhood there are great manufactories and warehouses for china and glass, and many other things; and some parts of the work are done by the people at home in their own houses. The morning of the day of which I am telling you had been spent by the children and their friends in visiting a very large china manufactory, and their heads were full of the pretty and wonderful things they had seen.",seem forget dwarf glad child travel uncle aunt way part way say most regular summer tourist other country prefer go sure find comfort luxury accustom home means way sense dull desert busy part world amazed tell beautiful thing make bare homely little german cottage neighborhood be great manufactory warehouse china glass many other thing part work do person home own house morning day tell spend child friend visit large china manufactory head full pretty wonderful thing see 
69,"And now they were waiting in the best parlor of the village inn while their uncle arranged about a carriage to take them all on to the small town where they were to stay a few days. Their aunt was tired, and was resting a little on the sofa, and they had planted themselves on the broad window-sill, and were looking out with amusement at all that passed.",wait good parlor village inn uncle arrange carriage take small town stay few day aunt tired rest little sofa plant broad window sill look amusement pass

78,"“Certainly,” she said, “we have already seen so many strange things in our travels that it is better not to be too sure what we may not see. But any way, Rex, you may be quite easy in your mind, that if ever you come across any of the dwarfs, you will find them very good-natured and amiable, only you must be very respectful—always say ‘Sir,’ or ‘My lord,’ or something like that to them, and bow a great deal. And you must never seem to think anything they do the least odd, not even if they propose to you to walk on your head, or to eat roast fir-cones for dinner, for instance.”",say see many strange thing travel good sure see way easy mind come dwarf find good natured amiable respectful say lord bow great deal seem think do least odd propose walk head eat roast fir cone dinner instance 
79,"Auntie was quite young—not so very much older than Olive—and very merry. Olive’s rather “grown-up” tones and manners used sometimes to tempt her to make fun of the little girl, which, to tell the truth, Olive did not always take quite in good part. And it must for Olive be allowed, that Auntie did sometimes allow her spirits and love of fun to run away with her a little too far, just like pretty unruly ponies, excited by the fresh air and sunshine, who toss their heads and gallop off. It is great fun at first and very nice to see, but one is sometimes afraid they may do some mischief on the way—without meaning it, of course; and, besides, it is not always so easy to pull them up as it was to start them.",young old merry grow tone manners use temp make fun little girl tell truth take good part allow allow spirit love fun run little unruly pony excite fresh air sunshine toss head gallop great fun first nice see afraid do mischief way mean course easy pull start 
80,"Just as Auntie finished speaking the door opened and their uncle came in. He was Auntie’s elder brother—a good deal older—and very kind and sensible. At once all thoughts of the dwarfs or what Auntie had been saying danced out of Rex’s curly head. Like a true boy he flew off to his uncle, besieging him with questions as to what sort of a carriage they were to go on in—_was_ it an ox-cart; oh, mightn’t they _for once_ go in an ox-cart? and might he—oh, might he sit beside the driver in front?",finish speak door open uncle come elder brother good deal old kind sensible thought dwarf say dance curly head true boy fly uncle besieg question sort carriage go ox cart _for once_ go ox cart sit driver front

82,"“Auntie,” she said, “you’re not _in earnest_, are you, about there being really a country of dwarfs?”",say country dwarf 
83,"Olive was twelve. Perhaps you will think her very silly to have imagined for a moment that her aunt’s joke could be anything but a joke, especially as she had been so sensible about not letting Rex get anything into his head which could frighten him. But I am not sure that she was so very silly after all. She had read in her geography about the Lapps and Finns, the tiny little men of the north, whom one might very well describe as dwarfs; there might be dwarfs in these strange Thüringian forests, which were little spoken of in geography books; Auntie knew more of such things than she did, for she had traveled in this country before. Then with her own eyes Olive had seen a dwarf, and though she had said to Rex that he was just an odd dwarf by himself as it were, not one of a race, how could she tell but what he might be one of a number of such queer little people? And even the blue dwarfs themselves—the little figures in the china manufactory—rather went to prove it than not.",think silly imagine moment aunt joke joke sensible let get head frighten sure silly read geography tiny little man north describe dwarf be dwarf strange forest little speak geography book know more such thing travel country own eye see dwarf say odd dwarf race tell number such queer little person blue dwarf little figure china manufactory go prove 
84,"“They may have taken the idea of dwarfs from the real ones, as Rex said,” thought Olive. “Any way I shall look well about me if we go through any of these forests again. They must live in the forests, for Auntie said they eat roast fir-cones for dinner.”",take idea dwarf real one say think way look go forest live forest say eat roast fir cone dinner

89,"“Yes,” said he, “I have. _Not_ an ox-cart, Rex. I’m sorry for your sake, but for no one else’s; for I don’t think there would be much left of us by the end of the journey if we were to be jogged along the forest roads in an ox-cart. No!

I remember it long ago, and I shall be glad to see it again.”",be little place forest look horse say get coffee want little nook remember glad see 
92,"Olive had pricked up her ears. “A little place in the forest!” she said to herself; “that may be near where the dwarfs live: it is most likely not far from here, because of the one we saw.” She would have liked to ask her uncle about it, but something in the look of her aunt’s eyes kept her from doing so.",prick ear little place forest say dwarf live likely one see like ask uncle look aunt eye keep do

94,"They were soon comfortably settled in the carriage, and set off. The first part of the drive was not particularly interesting; and it was so hot, though already afternoon, that they were all—Olive especially, you may be sure—delighted to exchange the open country for the pleasant shade of a grand pine forest, through which their road now lay.",settle carriage set first part drive interesting hot afternoon sure delight exchange open country pleasant shade grand pine forest road lay 
95,"“Is it a very large forest, Uncle?” said Olive.",large forest uncle say

But Olive’s imagination was far too hard at work to let her sleep.",large reply tell truth nodd little have asleep imagination hard work let sleep

102,"Auntie was a truer prophet than she knew; for when they got to the little hamlet in the wood, where they were to rest, something proved to be wrong with one of the horse’s shoes; _so_ wrong, indeed, that after a prolonged examination, at which all the inhabitants turned out to assist, it was decided that the horse must be re-shod before he could go any farther; and this made it impossible for the party who had come in the carriage to go any farther either. For the nearest smithy was two miles off; the horse must be led there and back by the driver, which would take at least two, if not three, hours. It was now past six, and they had come barely half way. The driver shook his head, and said he would not like to go on to the town till morning. The horse had pricked his foot; it might cause inflammation to drive him farther without a rest, and the carriage was far too heavy for the other horse alone, which had suddenly struck the children’s uncle as a brilliant idea.",truer prophet know get little hamlet wood rest prove wrong horse shoe wrong prolonged examination inhabitant turn assist decide horse re-shod go make impossible party come carriage go near smithy mile horse lead driver take least hour past come way driver shake head say like go town morning horse prick foot cause inflammation drive rest carriage heavy other horse strike child uncle brilliant idea

107,"The landlady of the little post-house where they had stopped was accustomed to occasional visits of this kind from benighted or distressed travelers. She thought nothing of turning her two daughters out of their bedroom, which, it must be owned, was very clean, for Auntie and Olive, and a second room on the ground-floor was prepared for Rex and his uncle. She had coffee ready in five minutes, and promised them a comfortable supper before bedtime. Altogether, everything seemed very satisfactory, and when they felt a little refreshed, Auntie proposed a walk—“a good long walk,” she said, “would do us good. And the landlady says we get out of the forest up there behind the house, where the ground rises, and that there is a lovely view. It will be rather a climb, but it isn’t more than three quarters of an hour from here, and we have not walked all day.”",landlady little post house stop accustom occasional visit kind benighted distressed traveler think turn daughter bedroom own clean second room ground floor prepare uncle have coffee ready minute promise comfortable supper bedtime seem satisfactory feel little refresh propose walk good long walk say do good landlady say get forest house ground rise be lovely view climb more quarter hour walk day

110,"“I am a little tired,” said Olive, which was true in one sense, though not in another, for she was quite fit for a walk.

And I do so like the forest.”",little tired say true sense fit walk strike excuse honest one add mind stay mind alone have book like forest

112,"So the three set off, leaving Olive to her own devices. She waited till they were out of sight, then she made her preparations.",set leave own device wait sight make preparation 
113,"“I’d better take my purse,” she said to herself, “in case I meet the dwarfs. Auntie told me to be very polite, and perhaps they would like some of these tiny pieces; they just look as if they were meant for them.” So she chose out a few one-pfennig copper coins, which are much smaller than our farthings, and one or two silver pieces, worth about twopence-halfpenny each, still smaller. Then she put in her pocket half a slice of the brown bread they had had with their coffee, and arming herself, more for appearance’-sake than anything else, with her parasol and the book she had with her in her traveling bag, she set off on her solitary ramble.",take purse say case meet dwarf tell polite like tiny piece look mean choose few pfennig copper coin small farthing silver piece worth twopence halfpenny small put pocket slice brown bread have coffee arme more appearance sake else parasol book have traveling bag set solitary ramble 
114,"It was still hot—though the forest trees made a pleasant shade. Olive walked some way, farther and farther, as far as she could make out, into the heart of the forest, but in her inexperience she took no sort of care to notice the way she went, or to make for herself any kind of landmarks. She just wandered on and on, tempted first by some mysterious little path, and then by another, her mind full of the idea of the discoveries she was perhaps about to make. Now and then a squirrel darted across from one tree to another, disappearing among the branches almost before Olive could be sure she had seen it, or some wild wood birds, less familiar to the little foreigner, would startle her with a shrill, strange note. There were here and there lovely flowers growing among the moss, and more than once she heard the sound of not far off trickling water. It was all strangely beautiful, and she would greatly have enjoyed and admired it had not her mind been so full of the queer fascinating idea of the blue dwarfs.",hot forest tree make pleasant shade walk way far far make heart forest inexperience take sort care notice way go make kind landmark wander tempt mysterious little path mind full idea discovery about make squirrel dart tree disappear branch sure see wild wood bird familiar little foreigner startle shrill strange note be lovely flower grow moss more hear sound trickle water beautiful enjoy admire mind full queer fascinating idea blue dwarf

117,"So Olive ensconced herself in a comfortable corner, her back against the root of a tree, which seemed hollowed out on purpose to serve as an armchair. She thought at first she would read a little, but the light was already slightly waning, and the tree shadows made it still fainter. Besides, Olive had plenty to think of—she did not require any amusement. Queer little noises now and then made themselves heard—once or twice it really sounded as if small feet were pattering along, or as if shrill little voices were laughing in the distance; and with each sound, Olive’s heart beat faster with excitement—not with fear.",ensconce comfortable corner back root tree seem hollow purpose serve armchair think first read little light wane tree shadow make fainter have plenty think require amusement queer little noise make hear sound small foot patter shrill little voice laugh distance sound heart beat fast excitement fear 
118,"“If I sit very still,” she thought, “who knows what I may see? Of course, it would be much nicer and prettier if the dwarfs were quite tiny—not like the little man we saw in the street at that place—I forget the name—for he was not pretty at all—but like the blue dwarfs at the manufactory. But that, I suppose, is impossible, for they would be really like fairies. But they might be something between: not so big as the little man, and yet bigger than the blue dwarfs.”",sit think know see course nice pretty dwarf tiny little man see street place forget name blue dwarf manufactory suppose impossible fairy big little man big blue dwarf 
119,"And then Olive grew a little confused in trying to settle in her mind how big, or how small rather, it was possible or impossible for a nation of dwarfs to be. She thought it over till she hardly seemed sure what she was trying to decide. She kept saying to herself, “Any way, they could not but be a good deal bigger than my thumb! What does that mean? Perhaps it means more in German measures than in English, perhaps——”",grow little confused try settle mind big small possible impossible nation dwarf think seem sure try decide keep say way good deal big thumb mean mean more german measure 
120,"But what was that that suddenly hit her on the nose! Olive looked up, a very little inclined to be offended; it is not a pleasant thing to be hit on the nose; could it be Rex come behind her suddenly, and playing her a trick? Just as she was thinking this, a second smart tap on the nose startled her still more, and this time there was no mistake about it; it came from above, and it was a fir-cone! Had it come of itself? Somehow the words, “Roast fir-cones for dinner,” kept running in her head, and she took up the fir-cone in her fingers to examine it, but quickly dropped it again, for it was as hot as a coal.",hit nose look little inclined offend pleasant thing hit nose come play trick think second smart tap nose startle more time be mistake come fir cone come word roast fir cone dinner keep run head take fir cone finger examine drop hot coal

122,"And hardly had she asked herself the question, when a sudden noise all round her made her again look up. They were sliding down the branches of the tree in all directions. At first, to her dazzled eyes, they seemed a whole army, but as they touched the ground one by one, and she was able to distinguish them better, she saw that after all there were not so _very_ many. One, two, three, she began quickly counting to herself, not aloud, of course—that would not have been polite—one, two, three, up to twelve, then thirteen, fourteen and so on up to—yes, there were just twenty-four of them.",ask question sudden noise make look slide branch tree direction first dazzle eye seem whole army touch ground able distinguish see many begin count course polite be

And immediately they settled themselves in twos—two squatted on the ground embracing their knees, two strode across a barrel which they had somehow or other brought with them, two began turning head-over-heels, two knelt down with their heads and queer little grinning faces looking over their shoulders, twos and twos of them in every funny position you could imagine, all arranged on the mossy ground in front of where Olive sat, and all dressed in the same bright blue coats as the toy dwarfs at the china manufactory.",blue dwarf mistake see settle two squatet ground embrace knee strode barrel other bring begin turn head heel knolt head queer little grinn face look shoulder two two funny position imagine arrange mossy ground front sit dress same bright blue coat toy dwarf china manufactory

127,"She had not long to wait. In another moment two little blue figures separated themselves from the crowd, and made their way up to her.

153,"The two dwarfs took no notice of what she said, but suddenly turned round, and standing with their backs to Olive called out shrilly, “Gueton Tag.” Immediately all the other dwarfs replied in the same tone and the same words, and to Olive’s great surprise they all began to move towards her, but without altering their attitudes—those on the barrel rolled towards her without getting off it; the two who were hugging their knees continued to hug them, while they came on by means of jerking themselves; the turning head-over-heels ones span along like wheels, and so on till the whole assemblage were at her feet. Then she saw unfolded before her, hanging on the branches of the tree, a large mantle, just the shape of her aunt’s travelling dust-cloak, which she always spread over Olive in a carriage, only, instead of being drab or fawn-colored, it was, like the dwarfs’ jackets, bright blue.

155,"The dwarfs marched—no! one cannot call it marching, for they had about a dozen different ways of proceeding—they moved on, and Olive in the middle, her blue cloak floating majestically on her shoulders. No one spoke a word. It grew darker and darker among the trees, but Olive did not feel frightened. On they went, till at last she saw twinkling before them a very small but bright blue light. It looked scarcely larger than the lamp of a glow-worm, but it shone out very distinct in the darkness. Immediately they saw it the dwarfs set up a shout, and as it died away, to Olive’s surprise, they began to sing. And what do you think they sang? Olive at first could hardly believe her ears as they listened to the thoroughly English song of “Home, sweet Home.” And the queerest thing was that they sang it very prettily, and that it sounded exactly like her aunt’s voice! And though they were walking close beside her, their voices when they left off singing did not so much seem to stop as to move off, to die away into the distance, which struck Olive as very odd.",dwarf march call marching have different way proceed move middle blue cloak float shoulder speak word grow dark dark tree feel frighten go last see twinkle small bright blue light look large lamp glow worm shine distinct darkness see dwarf set shout die surprise begin sing think sing believe ear listen english song sweet queerest thing sing sound aunt voice walk voice leave sing seem stop move die distance strike odd

157,"“Here we are,” said one of the dwarfs, she did not see which, “at the entrance to our village.” And thereupon all the dwarfs began climbing up the tree, swarming about it like a hive of bees, till they got some way up, when one after another they suddenly disappeared. Olive could see all they did by the blue light. She was beginning to wonder if she would be left standing there alone, when a shout made her look up, and she saw two dwarfs standing on a branch holding a rope ladder, which they had just thrown down, and making signs to her to mount up by it. It was quite easy; up went Olive, step by step, and when she reached the place where the two dwarfs were standing, she saw how it was that they had all disappeared. The tree trunk was hollow, and there were steps cut in it like a stair, down which the dwarfs signed to her that she was to go. She did not need to be twice told, so eager was she to see what was to come. The stair was rather difficult for her to get down without falling, for the steps were too small, being intended for the dwarfs, but Olive managed pretty well, only slipping now and then. The stair seemed very long, and as she went farther it grew darker, till at last it was quite dark; by which time, fortunately, however, she felt herself again on level ground, and after waiting half a minute a door seemed to open, and she found herself standing outside the tree stair, with the prettiest sight before her eyes that she had ever seen or even imagined.",say dwarf see entrance village dwarf begin climb tree swarm hive bee get way disappear see do blue light begin wonder leave stand shout make look see dwarf stand branch hold rope ladder throw make sign mount easy go step step reach place dwarf stand see disappear tree trunk hollow be step cut stair dwarf sign go need tell eager see come stair difficult get fall step small intend dwarf manage slip stair seem long go grow dark last dark time feel level ground wait minute door seem open find stand tree stair prettiest sight eye see imagine 
158,"It was the dwarf village! Rows and rows of tiny houses—none of them more than about twice as high as Olive herself, for that was quite big enough for a dwarf cottage, each with a sweet little garden in front, like what one sees in English villages, though the houses themselves were like Swiss châlets. It was not dark down here, there was a soft light about as bright as we have it at summer twilight; and besides this each little house had a twinkling blue light hanging above the front door, like a sign-post. And at the door of each cottage stood one of the dwarfs, with a little dwarf wife beside him; only, instead of blue, each little woman was dressed in brown, so that they were rather less showy than their husbands. They all began bowing as Olive appeared, and all the little women curtseying, and Olive seemed to understand, without being told, that she was to walk up the village street to see all there was to be seen. So on she marched, her blue cloak floating about her, so that sometimes it reached the roofs of the houses on each side at the same time.",dwarf village row row tiny house more high big dwarf cottage sweet little garden front see english village house swiss châlet dark be soft light bright have summer twilight little house have twinkle blue light hang front door sign post door cottage stand dwarf little dwarf wife blue little woman dress brown showy husband begin bow appear little woman curtsey seem understand tell walk village street see see march blue cloak float reach roof house side same time

Children are very fond of dreaming,” he went on, looking up at Olive with such a queer expression, and such a queer tone in his voice too, that Olive got a queer feeling herself, as if he meant more than his words actually said.

And through the windows she saw a long table neatly covered with a bright blue table-cloth, and spread with numbers of tiny plates, and beside each plate a knife and fork and a little blue glass cup. Two great dishes stood on the table, one at each end. Steam was rising from each, and a delicious smell came out through the open windows.",supper ready say wait turn see cottage good deal large other fact high considerable stooping get door window see long table cover bright blue table cloth spread number tiny plate plate knife fork little blue glass cup great dish stand table end rise delicious smell come open window

183,"“What did you do that for?” she exclaimed angrily. “Why did you scream out like that? I——” But she said no more. The cry was repeated, and this time it did its work effectually, for Olive awoke. Awoke—was it waking?—to find herself all in the dark, stiff and cold, and her head aching with the bump she had given it against the old tree-trunk, while farther off now she heard the same shrill hoot or cry of some early astir night-bird, which had sounded before in her dreams.",do exclaim scream say more cry repeat time do work awoke awoke wake find dark stiff cold head ach bump give old tree trunk hear same shrill hoot cry early astir night bird sound dream 
184,"“Oh dear! oh dear!” she sobbed, “what shall I do? Where am I? How can I ever find my way in the dark? I believe it was all a trick of those nasty blue dwarfs. I don’t believe I _was_ dreaming. They must be spiteful goblins. I wish I had not gone with them to see their village.” And so for some minutes, half asleep and half awake, Olive stayed crouching by the tree, which seemed her only protector. But by degrees, as her senses—her common sense particularly—came back to her, she began to realize that it was worse than useless to sit there crying. Dark as it was, she must try to find her way back to the little inn, where, doubtless, Auntie and the others were in the greatest distress about her, the thought of which nearly made her burst out crying again; and poor Olive stumbled up to her feet as best she could, fortunately not forgetting to feel for her book and parasol which were lying beside her and slowly and tremblingly made her way on a few steps, hoping that perhaps if she could manage to get out of the shadow of the trees it might not be quite so dark farther on. She was not altogether disappointed. It certainly grew a very little less black, but that it was a very dark night there was no denying. And, indeed, though it had not been dark, she would have had the greatest difficulty in finding her way out of the wood, into which she had so thoughtlessly penetrated. Terrifying thoughts, too, began to crowd into her mind, though, as I think I have shown you, she was not at all a timid child. But a forest on a dark night, and so far away from everywhere—it was enough to shake her nerves. She hoped and trusted there was no fear of wolves in summer-time; but bears!—ah! as to bears there was no telling. Even the hooting cries of the birds which she now and then again heard in the distance frightened her, and she felt that a bat flapping against her would send her nearly out of her mind. And after a while she began to lose heart—it was not quite so dark, but she had not the very least idea where she was going. She kept bumping and knocking herself against the trunks; she was evidently not in a path, but wandering farther and farther among the forest trees. That was about all she could feel sure of, and after two or three more vain efforts Olive fairly gave up, and, sinking down on the ground, again burst into tears.",sobb do find way dark believe trick nasty blue dwarf believe dreaming spiteful goblin wish go see village minute half asleep half awake stay crouch tree seem only protector degree sense common sense come begin realize bad useless sit cry dark try find way little inn other great distress thought make burst cry poor stumble foot good forget feel book parasol lie make way few step hope manage get shadow tree dark disappointed grow little black dark night be deny dark have great difficulty find way wood penetrate terrifying thought begin crowd mind think show timid child forest dark night enough shake nerve hope trust be fear wolf summer time bear bear be telling hooting cry bird hear distance frighten feel bat flap send mind while begin lose heart dark least idea go keep bump knock trunk path wonder far forest tree feel sure more vain effort give sink ground burst tear 
185,"“If I but had a mariner’s compass,” she thought, her fancy wandering off to all the stories of lost people she had ever heard of. Then she further reflected that a compass would do her very little good if it was too dark to see it, and still more as she had not the slightest idea whether her road lay north, south, east, or west. “If the stars were out!” was her next idea; but then, I am ashamed to say, Olive’s ideas of astronomy were limited. She could have perhaps recognized the Plow and the Pole star, but she could not remember which way they pointed. Besides, she did not feel quite sure that in Thüringen one would see the same stars as in England or Paris; and, after all, as there were none visible, it was no good puzzling about it, only if they _had_ been there it would not have seemed so lonely. Suddenly—what was that in the distance? A light, a tiny light, bobbing in and out of sight among the trees? Could it be a star come out of its way to take pity on her? Much more likely a Will-o’-the-wisp; for she did not stop to reflect that a dry pine forest in summer-time is not one of Will-o’-the-wisp’s favorite playgrounds. It was a light, as to that there was no doubt, and it was coming nearer. Whether she was more frightened or glad Olive scarcely knew. Still, almost anything was better than to sit there to be eaten up by bears, or to die of starvation; and she eagerly watched the light now steadily approaching her, till it came near enough for her to see that it was a lantern carried by some person not high above the ground. A boy perhaps; could it be—oh, joyful thought!—could it be Rex? But no; even if they were all looking for her it was not likely that they would let Rex be running about alone to get lost too. Still, it must _be_ a boy, and without waiting to think more Olive called out—",have mariner compass think fancy wonder story lose person hear reflect compass do little good dark see have slight idea road lay south east star next idea ashamed say idea astronomy limit recognize star remember way point feel sure see same star be visible good puzzling seem lonely distance light tiny light bob sight tree star come way take pity likely wisp stop reflect dry pine forest summer time wisp favorite playground light be doubt come frighten glad know good sit eat bear die starvation watch light approach come see lantern carry person high ground boy joyful thought look likely let run alone lose _be_ boy wait think call

188,"“_Ach Gott!_” exclaimed an unfamiliar voice, and Olive, peering forward, thought for half a second she was again dreaming. He was not, certainly, dressed in blue, and he was a good deal taller than up to her knee; but still he was—there was no doubt about it—he was a dwarf!

And somehow Olive’s faith in the possible existence of a nation of dwarfs had received a shock; she was much more inclined to take things prosaically. But it was very difficult to explain matters. I think the dwarf at the first moment was more inclined to take _her_ for something supernatural than she was now to imagine him a brownie or a gnome. For she was a pretty little girl, with a mass of golden fair hair and English blue eyes; and with her hat half fallen off, and her cheeks flushed, she might have sat for a picture of a fairy who had strayed from her home.",feel frighten look good natured sorry faith possible existence nation dwarf receive shock inclined take thing difficult explain matter think dwarf first moment inclined take _her_ supernatural imagine brownie gnome little girl mass golden fair hair english blue eye hat half fall cheek flush sit picture fairy stray home 
190,"Her German seemed all to go out of her head. But she managed to remember the name of the village where they had been that afternoon, and a sudden recollection seemed to come over the dwarf. He poured out a flood of words and exclamations, amidst which all that Olive could understand was the name of the village and the words “_verirrt_,” “_armes Kind_,” which she knew meant “lost” and “poor child.” Then he went on to tell that he too was on his way from the same village to somewhere; that he came by the woods, because it was shorter, and lifting high his lantern, gave Olive to understand that he could now show her the way.",seem go head manage remember name village afternoon sudden recollection seem come dwarf pour flood word exclamation understand name village word know mean lose poor child go tell way same village come wood short lift high lantern give understand show way 
191,"So off she set under his guidance, and, only fancy! a walk of not more than ten minutes brought them to the little inn! Olive’s wanderings and straying had, after all, drawn her very near her friends if she had known it. Poor Auntie and Rex were running about in front of the house in great distress. Uncle and the landlord and the coachman had set off with lanterns, and the landlady was trying to persuade Auntie that there was not _really_ anything to be afraid of; neither bears, nor wolves, nor evilly-disposed people about: the little young lady had, doubtless, fallen asleep in the wood with the heat and fatigue of the day; which, as you know, was a very good guess, though the landlady little imagined what queer places and people Olive had been visiting in her sleep.",set guidance fancy walk more minute bring little inn wandering straying draw friend know poor run front house great distress uncle landlord coachman set lantern landlady try persuade be afraid bear wolf dispose person little young lady fall asleep wood heat fatigue day know good guess landlady little imagine queer place person visit sleep 
192,"The dwarf was a well-known person thereabouts, and a very harmless, kindly little man. A present of a couple of marks sent him off to his cottage near by very happy indeed, and when Uncle returned a few minutes later to see if the wanderer had been heard of, you can imagine how thankful he was to find her. It was not so _very_ late after all, not above half-past ten o’clock, but a thunderstorm which came on not long after explained the unusual darkness of the cloud-covered sky.",dwarf know person harmless little man present couple mark send cottage happy return few minute see wanderer hear imagine thankful find late half past o'clock thunderstorm come explain unusual darkness cloud cover sky 
193,"“_What_ a good thing you were safe before the storm came on!” said Auntie, with a shudder at the thought of the dangers her darling had escaped. “I will take care never again to carry my jokes too far,” she resolved, when Olive had confided to her the real motive of her wanderings in the wood. And Olive, for her part, decided that she would be content with fairies and dwarfs in books and fancy, without trying to find them in reality.",good thing safe storm come say shudder thought danger darling escape take care carry joke resolve confide real motive wandering wood part decide content fairy dwarf book fancy try find reality
