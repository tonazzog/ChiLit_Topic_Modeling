1,CHAPTER X. THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF TOAD,chapter further adventure 
2,"The front door of the hollow tree faced eastwards, so Toad was called at an early hour; partly by the bright sunlight streaming in on him, partly by the exceeding coldness of his toes, which made him dream that he was at home in bed in his own handsome room with the Tudor window, on a cold winter’s night, and his bedclothes had got up, grumbling and protesting they couldn’t stand the cold any longer, and had run downstairs to the kitchen fire to warm themselves; and he had followed, on bare feet, along miles and miles of icy stone-paved passages, arguing and beseeching them to be reasonable. He would probably have been aroused much earlier, had he not slept for some weeks on straw over stone flags, and almost forgotten the friendly feeling of thick blankets pulled well up round the chin.",front door hollow tree face call early hour bright sunlight stream exceed coldness toe make dream home bed own handsome room window cold winter night bedclothe get grumble protest stand cold run kitchen fire warm follow bare foot mile mile icy stone paved passage argue beseech reasonable arouse sleep week straw stone flag forget friendly feeling thick blanket pull chin 
3,"Sitting up, he rubbed his eyes first and his complaining toes next, wondered for a moment where he was, looking round for familiar stone wall and little barred window; then, with a leap of the heart, remembered everything--his escape, his flight, his pursuit; remembered, first and best thing of all, that he was free!",sit rub eye complain toe wonder moment look familiar stone wall little barr window leap heart remember escape flight pursuit remember first good thing free 
4,"Free! The word and the thought alone were worth fifty blankets. He was warm from end to end as he thought of the jolly world outside, waiting eagerly for him to make his triumphal entrance, ready to serve him and play up to him, anxious to help him and to keep him company, as it always had been in days of old before misfortune fell upon him. He shook himself and combed the dry leaves out of his hair with his fingers; and, his toilet complete, marched forth into the comfortable morning sun, cold but confident, hungry but hopeful, all nervous terrors of yesterday dispelled by rest and sleep and frank and heartening sunshine.",free word thought worth blanket warm end end think jolly world wait make triumphal entrance ready serve play anxious help keep company day old misfortune fall shake comb dry leave hair finger toilet complete march comfortable morning sun cold confident hungry hopeful nervous terror yesterday dispell rest sleep frank heartening sunshine 
5,"He had the world all to himself, that early summer morning. The dewy woodland, as he threaded it, was solitary and still: the green fields that succeeded the trees were his own to do as he liked with; the road itself, when he reached it, in that loneliness that was everywhere, seemed, like a stray dog, to be looking anxiously for company. Toad, however, was looking for something that could talk, and tell him clearly which way he ought to go. It is all very well, when you have a light heart, and a clear conscience, and money in your pocket, and nobody scouring the country for you to drag you off to prison again, to follow where the road beckons and points, not caring whither. The practical Toad cared very much indeed, and he could have kicked the road for its helpless silence when every minute was of importance to him.",have world early summer morning dewy woodland thread solitary green field succeed tree own do like road reach loneliness seem stray dog look company look talk tell way go have light heart clear conscience money pocket scour country drag prison follow road beckon point care practical care kick road helpless silence minute importance 
6,"The reserved rustic road was presently joined by a shy little brother in the shape of a canal, which took its hand and ambled along by its side in perfect confidence, but with the same tongue-tied, uncommunicative attitude towards strangers. ‘Bother them!’ said Toad to himself. ‘But, anyhow, one thing’s clear. They must both be coming FROM somewhere, and going TO somewhere. You can’t get over that. Toad, my boy!’ So he marched on patiently by the water’s edge.",reserve rustic road join shy little brother shape canal take hand amble side perfect confidence same tongue tie uncommunicative attitude stranger bother say thing clear come go get boy march water edge 
7,"Round a bend in the canal came plodding a solitary horse, stooping forward as if in anxious thought. From rope traces attached to his collar stretched a long line, taut, but dipping with his stride, the further part of it dripping pearly drops. Toad let the horse pass, and stood waiting for what the fates were sending him.",bend canal come plodd solitary horse stoop anxious thought rope trace attach collar stretch long line taut dip stride further part drip drop let horse pass stand wait fate send 
8,"With a pleasant swirl of quiet water at its blunt bow the barge slid up alongside of him, its gaily painted gunwale level with the towing-path, its sole occupant a big stout woman wearing a linen sun-bonnet, one brawny arm laid along the tiller.",pleasant swirl quiet water blunt bow barge slide paint gunwale level towing path sole occupant big stout woman wear linen sun-bonnet brawny arm lay tiller 
9,"‘A nice morning, ma’am!’ she remarked to Toad, as she drew up level with him.",nice morning remark draw level 
10,"‘I dare say it is, ma’am!’ responded Toad politely, as he walked along the tow-path abreast of her. ‘I dare it IS a nice morning to them that’s not in sore trouble, like what I am. Here’s my married daughter, she sends off to me post-haste to come to her at once; so off I comes, not knowing what may be happening or going to happen, but fearing the worst, as you will understand, ma’am, if you’re a mother, too. And I’ve left my business to look after itself--I’m in the washing and laundering line, you must know, ma’am--and I’ve left my young children to look after themselves, and a more mischievous and troublesome set of young imps doesn’t exist, ma’am; and I’ve lost all my money, and lost my way, and as for what may be happening to my married daughter, why, I don’t like to think of it, ma’am!’",say respond walk tow path abreast dare nice morning sore trouble married daughter send post haste come come know happen go happen fear bad understand mother leave business look washing laundering line know leave young child look mischievous troublesome set young imp exist lose money lose way happen married daughter like think

13,"‘Toad Hall? Why, I’m going that way myself,’ replied the barge-woman. ‘This canal joins the river some miles further on, a little above Toad Hall; and then it’s an easy walk. You come along in the barge with me, and I’ll give you a lift.’",go way reply barge woman canal join river mile little easy walk come barge give lift

16,"‘Finest business in the whole country,’ said Toad airily. ‘All the gentry come to me--wouldn’t go to any one else if they were paid, they know me so well. You see, I understand my work thoroughly, and attend to it all myself. Washing, ironing, clear-starching, making up gents’ fine shirts for evening wear--everything’s done under my own eye!’",fine business whole country say gentry come go one pay know see understand work attend washing ironing clear starching make gent fine shirt evening wear do own eye

19,"‘So do I, too,’ said the barge-woman with great heartiness. ‘But I dare say you set yours to rights, the idle trollops! And are you very fond of washing?’",say barge woman great heartiness say set right idle trollop fond washing 
20,"‘I love it,’ said Toad. ‘I simply dote on it. Never so happy as when I’ve got both arms in the wash-tub. But, then, it comes so easy to me! No trouble at all! A real pleasure, I assure you, ma’am!’",love say do happy get arm wash tub come easy trouble real pleasure assure 
21,"‘What a bit of luck, meeting you!’ observed the barge-woman, thoughtfully. ‘A regular piece of good fortune for both of us!’",bit luck meet observe barge woman regular piece good fortune 
22,"‘Why, what do you mean?’ asked Toad, nervously.",mean ask 
23,"‘Well, look at me, now,’ replied the barge-woman. ‘_I_ like washing, too, just the same as you do; and for that matter, whether I like it or not I have got to do all my own, naturally, moving about as I do. Now my husband, he’s such a fellow for shirking his work and leaving the barge to me, that never a moment do I get for seeing to my own affairs. By rights he ought to be here now, either steering or attending to the horse, though luckily the horse has sense enough to attend to himself. Instead of which, he’s gone off with the dog, to see if they can’t pick up a rabbit for dinner somewhere. Says he’ll catch me up at the next lock. Well, that’s as may be--I don’t trust him, once he gets off with that dog, who’s worse than he is. But meantime, how am I to get on with my washing?’",look reply barge woman washing same do matter like get do own move husband fellow shirk work leave barge moment get see own affair right steering attend horse horse have sense attend go dog see pick rabbit dinner say catch next lock trust get dog bad meantime get washing

25,"‘I can’t fix my mind on anything but my washing,’ said the barge-woman, ‘and I wonder you can be talking of rabbits, with such a joyful prospect before you. There’s a heap of things of mine that you’ll find in a corner of the cabin. If you’ll just take one or two of the most necessary sort--I won’t venture to describe them to a lady like you, but you’ll recognise them at a glance--and put them through the wash-tub as we go along, why, it’ll be a pleasure to you, as you rightly say, and a real help to me. You’ll find a tub handy, and soap, and a kettle on the stove, and a bucket to haul up water from the canal with. Then I shall know you’re enjoying yourself, instead of sitting here idle, looking at the scenery and yawning your head off.’",fix mind washing say barge woman wonder talk rabbit joyful prospect be heap thing find corner cabin take necessary sort venture describe lady recognise glance put wash tub go pleasure say real help find tub handy soap kettle stove bucket haul water canal know enjoy sit idle look scenery yawn head 
26,"‘Here, you let me steer!’ said Toad, now thoroughly frightened, ‘and then you can get on with your washing your own way. I might spoil your things, or not do ‘em as you like. I’m more used to gentlemen’s things myself. It’s my special line.’",let steer say frighten get wash own way spoil thing do like use gentleman thing special line 
27,"‘Let you steer?’ replied the barge-woman, laughing. ‘It takes some practice to steer a barge properly. Besides, it’s dull work, and I want you to be happy. No, you shall do the washing you are so fond of, and I’ll stick to the steering that I understand. Don’t try and deprive me of the pleasure of giving you a treat!’",let steer reply barge woman laugh take practice steer barge dull work want happy do washing fond stick steering understand try deprive pleasure give treat 
28,"Toad was fairly cornered. He looked for escape this way and that, saw that he was too far from the bank for a flying leap, and sullenly resigned himself to his fate. ‘If it comes to that,’ he thought in desperation, ‘I suppose any fool can WASH!’",corner look escape way see bank fly leap resign fate come think desperation suppose fool wash 
29,"He fetched tub, soap, and other necessaries from the cabin, selected a few garments at random, tried to recollect what he had seen in casual glances through laundry windows, and set to.",fetched tub soap other necessary cabin select few garment random try recollect see casual glance laundry window set 
30,"A long half-hour passed, and every minute of it saw Toad getting crosser and crosser. Nothing that he could do to the things seemed to please them or do them good. He tried coaxing, he tried slapping, he tried punching; they smiled back at him out of the tub unconverted, happy in their original sin. Once or twice he looked nervously over his shoulder at the barge-woman, but she appeared to be gazing out in front of her, absorbed in her steering. His back ached badly, and he noticed with dismay that his paws were beginning to get all crinkly. Now Toad was very proud of his paws. He muttered under his breath words that should never pass the lips of either washerwomen or Toads; and lost the soap, for the fiftieth time.",long half hour pass minute see get crosser crosser do thing seem please do good try coax try slap try punch smile tub unconvert happy original sin look shoulder barge woman appear gaze front absorb steering back ach notice dismay paw begin get proud paw mutter breath word pass lip washerwomen toad lose soap fiftieth time

32,"‘I’ve been watching you all the time,’ she gasped. ‘I thought you must be a humbug all along, from the conceited way you talked. Pretty washerwoman you are! Never washed so much as a dish-clout in your life, I’ll lay!’",watch time gasp think humbug conceited way talk washerwoman wash dish clout life lay 
33,"Toad’s temper which had been simmering viciously for some time, now fairly boiled over, and he lost all control of himself.",temper simmer time boil lose control 
34,"‘You common, low, FAT barge-woman!’ he shouted; ‘don’t you dare to talk to your betters like that! Washerwoman indeed! I would have you to know that I am a Toad, a very well-known, respected, distinguished Toad! I may be under a bit of a cloud at present, but I will NOT be laughed at by a bargewoman!’",common low fat barge woman shout dare talk better washerwoman have know know respect distinguished bit cloud present laugh bargewoman 
35,"The woman moved nearer to him and peered under his bonnet keenly and closely. ‘Why, so you are!’ she cried. ‘Well, I never! A horrid, nasty, crawly Toad! And in my nice clean barge, too! Now that is a thing that I will NOT have.’",woman move peer bonnet cry horrid nasty crawly toad nice clean barge thing have 
36,"She relinquished the tiller for a moment. One big mottled arm shot out and caught Toad by a fore-leg, while the other-gripped him fast by a hind-leg. Then the world turned suddenly upside down, the barge seemed to flit lightly across the sky, the wind whistled in his ears, and Toad found himself flying through the air, revolving rapidly as he went.",relinquish tiller moment big mottled arm shoot catch fore leg other grip hind leg world turn barge seem flit sky wind whistle ear find fly air revolve go 
37,"The water, when he eventually reached it with a loud splash, proved quite cold enough for his taste, though its chill was not sufficient to quell his proud spirit, or slake the heat of his furious temper. He rose to the surface spluttering, and when he had wiped the duck-weed out of his eyes the first thing he saw was the fat barge-woman looking back at him over the stern of the retreating barge and laughing; and he vowed, as he coughed and choked, to be even with her.",water reach loud splash prove cold taste chill sufficient quell proud spirit slake heat furious temper rise surface splutter wipe duck weed eye first thing see fat barge woman look stern retreat barge laugh vow cough choke 
38,"He struck out for the shore, but the cotton gown greatly impeded his efforts, and when at length he touched land he found it hard to climb up the steep bank unassisted. He had to take a minute or two’s rest to recover his breath; then, gathering his wet skirts well over his arms, he started to run after the barge as fast as his legs would carry him, wild with indignation, thirsting for revenge.",strike shore cotton gown imped effort length touch land find hard climb steep bank unassist have take minute rest recover breath gather wet skirt arm start run barge leg carry wild indignation thirst revenge 
39,"The barge-woman was still laughing when he drew up level with her. ‘Put yourself through your mangle, washerwoman,’ she called out, ‘and iron your face and crimp it, and you’ll pass for quite a decent-looking Toad!’",barge woman laugh draw level put mangle washerwoman call iron face crimp pass decent look toad 
40,"Toad never paused to reply. Solid revenge was what he wanted, not cheap, windy, verbal triumphs, though he had a thing or two in his mind that he would have liked to say. He saw what he wanted ahead of him. Running swiftly on he overtook the horse, unfastened the towrope and cast off, jumped lightly on the horse’s back, and urged it to a gallop by kicking it vigorously in the sides. He steered for the open country, abandoning the tow-path, and swinging his steed down a rutty lane. Once he looked back, and saw that the barge had run aground on the other side of the canal, and the barge-woman was gesticulating wildly and shouting, ‘Stop, stop, stop!’ ‘I’ve heard that song before,’ said Toad, laughing, as he continued to spur his steed onward in its wild career.",pause reply solid revenge want cheap windy verbal triumph have thing mind like say see want runn overtake horse unfasten towrope cast jump horse urge gallop kick side steer open country abandon tow path swing steed rutty lane look see barge run other side canal barge woman gesticulate shouting stop stop stop hear song say laugh continue spur steed wild career 
41,"The barge-horse was not capable of any very sustained effort, and its gallop soon subsided into a trot, and its trot into an easy walk; but Toad was quite contented with this, knowing that he, at any rate, was moving, and the barge was not. He had quite recovered his temper, now that he had done something he thought really clever; and he was satisfied to jog along quietly in the sun, steering his horse along by-ways and bridle-paths, and trying to forget how very long it was since he had had a square meal, till the canal had been left very far behind him.",barge horse capable sustained effort gallop subside trot trot easy walk contented know rate move barge recover temper do think clever satisfied jog sun steering horse way bridle path try forget have square meal canal leave 
42,"He had travelled some miles, his horse and he, and he was feeling drowsy in the hot sunshine, when the horse stopped, lowered his head, and began to nibble the grass; and Toad, waking up, just saved himself from falling off by an effort. He looked about him and found he was on a wide common, dotted with patches of gorse and bramble as far as he could see. Near him stood a dingy gipsy caravan, and beside it a man was sitting on a bucket turned upside down, very busy smoking and staring into the wide world. A fire of sticks was burning near by, and over the fire hung an iron pot, and out of that pot came forth bubblings and gurglings, and a vague suggestive steaminess. Also smells--warm, rich, and varied smells--that twined and twisted and wreathed themselves at last into one complete, voluptuous, perfect smell that seemed like the very soul of Nature taking form and appearing to her children, a true Goddess, a mother of solace and comfort. Toad now knew well that he had not been really hungry before. What he had felt earlier in the day had been a mere trifling qualm. This was the real thing at last, and no mistake; and it would have to be dealt with speedily, too, or there would be trouble for somebody or something. He looked the gipsy over carefully, wondering vaguely whether it would be easier to fight him or cajole him. So there he sat, and sniffed and sniffed, and looked at the gipsy; and the gipsy sat and smoked, and looked at him.",travel mile horse feel drowsy hot sunshine horse stop lower head begin nibble grass wake save fall effort look find wide common dot patch gorse bramble see stand dingy gipsy caravan man sit bucket turn busy smoke stare wide world fire stick burn fire hang iron pot pot come bubbling gurgling vague suggestive steaminess smell warm rich varied smell twin twist wreathe last complete voluptuous perfect smell seem very soul take form appear child true mother solace comfort know hungry feel day mere trifling qualm real thing last mistake have deal be trouble look gipsy wonder easy fight cajole sit sniff sniff look gipsy gipsy sit smoke look 
43,"Presently the gipsy took his pipe out of his mouth and remarked in a careless way, ‘Want to sell that there horse of yours?’",gipsy take pipe mouth remark careless way want sell horse 
44,"Toad was completely taken aback. He did not know that gipsies were very fond of horse-dealing, and never missed an opportunity, and he had not reflected that caravans were always on the move and took a deal of drawing. It had not occurred to him to turn the horse into cash, but the gipsy’s suggestion seemed to smooth the way towards the two things he wanted so badly--ready money, and a solid breakfast.",take know gipsie fond horse deal miss opportunity reflect caravan move take deal draw occur turn horse cash gipsy suggestion seem smooth way thing want ready money solid breakfast 
45,"‘What?’ he said, ‘me sell this beautiful young horse of mine? O, no; it’s out of the question. Who’s going to take the washing home to my customers every week? Besides, I’m too fond of him, and he simply dotes on me.’",say sell beautiful young horse question go take washing home customer week fond dote 
46,"‘Try and love a donkey,’ suggested the gipsy. ‘Some people do.’",try love donkey suggest gipsy person 
47,"‘You don’t seem to see,’ continued Toad, ‘that this fine horse of mine is a cut above you altogether. He’s a blood horse, he is, partly; not the part you see, of course--another part. And he’s been a Prize Hackney, too, in his time--that was the time before you knew him, but you can still tell it on him at a glance, if you understand anything about horses. No, it’s not to be thought of for a moment. All the same, how much might you be disposed to offer me for this beautiful young horse of mine?’",seem see continue fine horse cut blood horse part see course part time time know tell glance understand horse think moment same dispose offer beautiful young horse 
48,"The gipsy looked the horse over, and then he looked Toad over with equal care, and looked at the horse again. ‘Shillin’ a leg,’ he said briefly, and turned away, continuing to smoke and try to stare the wide world out of countenance.",gipsy look horse look equal care look horse leg say turn continue smoke try stare wide world countenance 
49,"‘A shilling a leg?’ cried Toad. ‘If you please, I must take a little time to work that out, and see just what it comes to.’",shill leg cry take little time work see come 
50,"He climbed down off his horse, and left it to graze, and sat down by the gipsy, and did sums on his fingers, and at last he said, ‘A shilling a leg? Why, that comes to exactly four shillings, and no more. O, no; I could not think of accepting four shillings for this beautiful young horse of mine.’",climb horse leave graze sit gipsy do sum finger last say shill leg come shilling more think accept shilling beautiful young horse 
51,"‘Well,’ said the gipsy, ‘I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll make it five shillings, and that’s three-and-sixpence more than the animal’s worth. And that’s my last word.’",say gipsy tell do make shilling sixpence more animal worth last word 
52,"Then Toad sat and pondered long and deeply. For he was hungry and quite penniless, and still some way--he knew not how far--from home, and enemies might still be looking for him. To one in such a situation, five shillings may very well appear a large sum of money. On the other hand, it did not seem very much to get for a horse. But then, again, the horse hadn’t cost him anything; so whatever he got was all clear profit. At last he said firmly, ‘Look here, gipsy! I tell you what we will do; and this is MY last word. You shall hand me over six shillings and sixpence, cash down; and further, in addition thereto, you shall give me as much breakfast as I can possibly eat, at one sitting of course, out of that iron pot of yours that keeps sending forth such delicious and exciting smells. In return, I will make over to you my spirited young horse, with all the beautiful harness and trappings that are on him, freely thrown in. If that’s not good enough for you, say so, and I’ll be getting on. I know a man near here who’s wanted this horse of mine for years.’",sit ponder hungry penniless way know home enemy look situation shilling appear large sum money other hand seem much get horse horse cost get clear profit last say look gipsy tell do last word hand shilling sixpence cash addition give much breakfast eat sitting course iron pot keep send such delicious exciting smell return make spirit young horse beautiful harness trapping throw good say get know man want horse year 
53,"The gipsy grumbled frightfully, and declared if he did a few more deals of that sort he’d be ruined. But in the end he lugged a dirty canvas bag out of the depths of his trouser pocket, and counted out six shillings and sixpence into Toad’s paw. Then he disappeared into the caravan for an instant, and returned with a large iron plate and a knife, fork, and spoon. He tilted up the pot, and a glorious stream of hot rich stew gurgled into the plate. It was, indeed, the most beautiful stew in the world, being made of partridges, and pheasants, and chickens, and hares, and rabbits, and pea-hens, and guinea-fowls, and one or two other things. Toad took the plate on his lap, almost crying, and stuffed, and stuffed, and stuffed, and kept asking for more, and the gipsy never grudged it him. He thought that he had never eaten so good a breakfast in all his life.",gipsy grumble declare do few more deal sort ruin end lugge dirty canvas bag depth trouser pocket count shilling sixpence paw disappear caravan instant return large iron plate knife fork spoon tilt pot glorious stream hot rich stew gurgle plate beautiful stew world make partridge pheasant chicken hare rabbit pea-hen guinea fowl other thing take plate lap cry stuff stuff stuff keep ask more gipsy grudge think eat good breakfast life 
54,"When Toad had taken as much stew on board as he thought he could possibly hold, he got up and said good-bye to the gipsy, and took an affectionate farewell of the horse; and the gipsy, who knew the riverside well, gave him directions which way to go, and he set forth on his travels again in the best possible spirits. He was, indeed, a very different Toad from the animal of an hour ago. The sun was shining brightly, his wet clothes were quite dry again, he had money in his pocket once more, he was nearing home and friends and safety, and, most and best of all, he had had a substantial meal, hot and nourishing, and felt big, and strong, and careless, and self-confident.",take much stew board think hold get say good bye gipsy take affectionate farewell horse gipsy know give direction way go set travel good possible spirit different toad animal hour sun shine wet clothes dry have money pocket more near home friend safety most good have substantial meal hot nourishing feel big strong careless self confident 
55,"As he tramped along gaily, he thought of his adventures and escapes, and how when things seemed at their worst he had always managed to find a way out; and his pride and conceit began to swell within him. ‘Ho, ho!’ he said to himself as he marched along with his chin in the air, ‘what a clever Toad I am! There is surely no animal equal to me for cleverness in the whole world! My enemies shut me up in prison, encircled by sentries, watched night and day by warders; I walk out through them all, by sheer ability coupled with courage. They pursue me with engines, and policemen, and revolvers; I snap my fingers at them, and vanish, laughing, into space. I am, unfortunately, thrown into a canal by a woman fat of body and very evil-minded. What of it? I swim ashore, I seize her horse, I ride off in triumph, and I sell the horse for a whole pocketful of money and an excellent breakfast! Ho, ho! I am The Toad, the handsome, the popular, the successful Toad!’ He got so puffed up with conceit that he made up a song as he walked in praise of himself, and sang it at the top of his voice, though there was no one to hear it but him. It was perhaps the most conceited song that any animal ever composed.",tramp think adventure escape thing seem bad manage find way pride conceit begin swell say march chin air clever be animal equal cleverness whole world enemy shut prison encircle sentry watch night day warder walk sheer ability couple courage pursue engine policemen revolver snap finger vanish laugh space throw canal woman fat body evil minded swim seize horse ride triumph sell horse whole pocketful money excellent breakfast handsome popular successful get puff conceit make song walk praise sing top voice be hear conceited song animal compose

64,"‘This is something like!’ said the excited Toad. ‘This is real life again, this is once more the great world from which I have been missed so long! I will hail them, my brothers of the wheel, and pitch them a yarn, of the sort that has been so successful hitherto; and they will give me a lift, of course, and then I will talk to them some more; and, perhaps, with luck, it may even end in my driving up to Toad Hall in a motor-car!

65,"He stepped confidently out into the road to hail the motor-car, which came along at an easy pace, slowing down as it neared the lane; when suddenly he became very pale, his heart turned to water, his knees shook and yielded under him, and he doubled up and collapsed with a sickening pain in his interior. And well he might, the unhappy animal; for the approaching car was the very one he had stolen out of the yard of the Red Lion Hotel on that fatal day when all his troubles began!

O, what a fool I have been!

67,"The terrible motor-car drew slowly nearer and nearer, till at last he heard it stop just short of him. Two gentlemen got out and walked round the trembling heap of crumpled misery lying in the road, and one of them said, ‘O dear! this is very sad! Here is a poor old thing--a washerwoman apparently--who has fainted in the road! Perhaps she is overcome by the heat, poor creature; or possibly she has not had any food to-day.

The rush of air in his face, the hum of the engines, and the light jump of the car beneath him intoxicated his weak brain. ‘Washerwoman, indeed!’ he shouted recklessly. ‘Ho! ho!

85,"Toad found himself flying through the air with the strong upward rush and delicate curve of a swallow. He liked the motion, and was just beginning to wonder whether it would go on until he developed wings and turned into a Toad-bird, when he landed on his back with a thump, in the soft rich grass of a meadow. Sitting up, he could just see the motor-car in the pond, nearly submerged; the gentlemen and the driver, encumbered by their long coats, were floundering helplessly in the water.",find fly air strong upward rush delicate curve swallow like motion begin wonder go develop wing turn toad bird land back thump soft rich grass meadow sit see motor car pond submerge gentleman driver encumber long coat flounder water

When he had recovered his breath somewhat, and was able to think calmly, he began to giggle, and from giggling he took to laughing, and he laughed till he had to sit down under a hedge. ‘Ho, ho!’ he cried, in ecstasies of self-admiration, ‘Toad again! Toad, as usual, comes out on the top! Who was it got them to give him a lift? Who managed to get on the front seat for the sake of fresh air? Who persuaded them into letting him see if he could drive? Who landed them all in a horse-pond?

He did his best, but he was a fat animal, and his legs were short, and still they gained. He could hear them close behind him now. Ceasing to heed where he was going, he struggled on blindly and wildly, looking back over his shoulder at the now triumphant enemy, when suddenly the earth failed under his feet, he grasped at the air, and, splash! he found himself head over ears in deep water, rapid water, water that bore him along with a force he could not contend with; and he knew that in his blind panic he had run straight into the river!",glance see dismay gain run keep look see gain do good fat animal leg short gain hear cease heed go struggle look shoulder triumphant enemy earth fail foot grasp air splash find head ear deep water rapid water water bear force contend know blind panic run river

If ever I sing another conceited song’--then down he went, and came up breathless and spluttering. Presently he saw that he was approaching a big dark hole in the bank, just above his head, and as the stream bore him past he reached up with a paw and caught hold of the edge and held on. Then slowly and with difficulty he drew himself up out of the water, till at last he was able to rest his elbows on the edge of the hole. There he remained for some minutes, puffing and panting, for he was quite exhausted.",rise surface try grasp reed rushe grow water edge close bank stream strong tore hand gasp poor steal motor car sing conceited song go come breathless splutter see approach big dark hole bank head stream bear reach paw catch hold edge hold difficulty draw water last able rest elbow edge hole remain minute puffing pant exhausted
