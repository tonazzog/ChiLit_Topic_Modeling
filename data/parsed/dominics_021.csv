4,"Some of my readers may know the queer sensation one sometimes gets at the approach of a long-looked-for and hardly-worked-for examination. For a week or so you have quietly been counting up what you _do_ know. Now there breaks upon you an awful picture of what you do _not_ know, and with it the absolute conviction that what you do not know is exactly what you ought to know, and what you do know is no use at all.  It is too late to do anything.  You cannot get up in a day what it would take you a fortnight to go through.  And it is not much good, now you are sure it is useless, to go over again what you have done.  You begin to feel a sort of despair, which becomes, as the hours close in, positively reckless.  What do you care if you do miss?  What's the use of bothering any more about it?  It cannot be helped; why make yourself miserable? Only, you would give worlds to have the thing all over.  Such at least were the sensations which stirred in the breasts of Oliver Greenfield and Horace Wraysford as they sat somewhat dejectedly over their books in Oliver's study that Saturday afternoon.",reader know queer sensation get approach long look work examination week count know break awful picture know absolute conviction know know know use late do get day take fortnight go good sure useless go do begin feel sort despair become hour reckless care miss use bother more help make miserable give world have thing such least sensation stirr breast sit book study afternoon 
5,"They had both worked hard since the holidays, generally together, neither concealing from the other what he had read or what he intended to read.  Very bad rivals were these two, for though each was intent on winning the scholarship, each felt he would not break his heart if the other beat him, and that, as every one knows, is a most unheard-of piece of toleration.  Now, however, each felt he had had enough of it.  Oliver in particular was very despondent.  He slammed up his books suddenly, and said, ""I give it up; it's not a bit of use going on!""",work holiday conceal other read intend read bad rival intent win scholarship feel break heart other beat one know unheard piece toleration feel have enough particular despondent slam book say give bit use go

I was going over some of those brutal Roman History dates in bed last night, for instance, and I positively couldn't remember one.  Then I tried the map of Greece, but I was still worse there; I couldn't remember where one single place was except Athens and Corinth, and I'm sure I used to be pretty well up in that.""",pursue bend melancholy tack assure forget half know go brutal roman date bed last night instance remember try map bad remember single place sure use

27,"It was quite a revelation to the two boys to discover how great was the interest taken by outsiders in the coming event.  Paul was in a great state of alarm, and was actually inclined to refuse to aid and abet what he imagined to be a wicked waste of precious opportunity, until, putting his head into Loman's study, he found that the Sixth Form fellow was also not at work.",revelation boy discover great interest take outsider come event great state alarm inclined refuse aid abet imagine wicked waste precious opportunity put head study find sixth fellow work

Threats, promises, entreaties, would not put them off their row up the river, and they went on their way, leaving behind them an unusual gloom on the spirits of their dearest friends.",other fifth form fellow encounter echoe more same advice friend obdurate threat promise entreaty put row river go way leave unusual gloom spirit dearest friend 
36,"The only person who seemed really glad to see them leaving their work was Bramble.

42,"The two friends paddled quietly up the river.  They talked very little, but both felt relieved to be away from their books.  As they went on their spirits rose, greatly to Paul's displeasure.  That young gentleman, immoderately jealous for the glory of the Fifth, was content as long as the two rowers remained grave and serious; he could then make himself believe they were engaged in mental exercises favourable to Monday's examination.  But as soon as they began to whistle, and chaff him and one another, and talk of their holiday adventures, Paul became displeased, for they could not possibly do this and be inwardly preparing for the examination at the same time.",friend paddle river talk little feel relieve book go spirit rise displeasure young gentleman jealous glory fifth content rower remain grave serious make believe engage mental exercise favourable examination begin whistle chaff talk holiday adventure become displease do prepare examination same time

50,"They paddled on again until Gusset Lock came in sight.  There were very few boats about; the season was, in fact, at an end, and the river, which a month or two ago had generally swarmed with boats just at this part on Saturday afternoons, looked quite deserted.",paddle come sight be few boat season fact end river month swarm boat part afternoon look desert

Oliver, however, having once heard Stephen's name, ordered Paul to put them into the opposite bank quick, where they could land.",boat low bank impossible see go tow path hear name order put opposite bank land 
60,"While this was being done a shriek from the bank sent the blood suddenly to the faces of the two friends.  It was Stephen!  They dashed ashore, and in a moment were across the lock and on the spot.  The spectacle which met their eyes as they came up was a strange one.  The central figure was the luckless Stephen, in the clutches of three or four disreputable fellows, one of whom was Cripps the younger, who, with loud laughter at the boy's struggles and brutal unconcern at his terror, were half dragging, half carrying him towards the water's edge.",do shriek bank send blood face friend dash moment lock spot spectacle meet eye come strange one central figure luckless clutch disreputable fellow young loud laughter boy struggle brutal unconcern terror half drag half carry water edge

66,"With a bound Oliver sprang furiously on Cripps, who happened to be nearest him, and before that respectable gentleman knew where he was, had dealt him a blow which sent him staggering back in the utmost alarm and astonishment.  Wraysford, no less prompt, tackled one of the other blackguards, while Stephen, now released, and cured of his momentary terror by the appearance of the rescuers, did his share manfully with one of the others.",bind spring happen respectable gentleman know deal blow send staggering utmost alarm astonishment prompt tackle other blackguard release cure momentary terror appearance rescuer do share other 
67,"The contest was short and sharp.  A pair of well-trained athletic schoolboys, with a plucky youngster to help them, are a match any day for twice the number of half-tipsy cads.  In a minute or two the field was clear of all but Cripps, who appeared, after his short experience, by no means disposed to continue the contest single-handed.  As for Loman, he had disappeared.",contest short sharp pair train athletic schoolboy plucky youngster help match day number half tipsy cad minute field clear appear short experience means dispose continue contest single handed disappear

71,"Mr Cripps, who had had time to recover somewhat from his first surprise, looked a little inclined to defy his young antagonist, but, thinking better of it, suddenly assumed his usual impudent swagger as he replied, with a laugh, ""Come, I say, you _do_ do it well, you do!  It was a joke--just a joke, young gentleman.  You've no occasion to flurry yourself; we wouldn't have hurt a hair of the young gentleman's head.

Here Paul, who had been a witness of the _fracas_ on the tow-path, was waiting, ready to steer home, and bursting with curiosity to hear all Stephen had to say.",look dispose resist cast glance cottage door vanish let persuade turn boat witness _fracas_ tow path wait ready steer burst curiosity hear have say
