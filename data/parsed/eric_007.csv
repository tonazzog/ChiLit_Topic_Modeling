3,"The holidays were over. Vernon was to have a tutor at Fairholm, and Eric was to return alone, and be received into Dr. Rowlands' house.",holiday have tutor return receive house 
4,"As he went on board the steam-packet, he saw numbers of the well-known faces on deck, and merry voices greeted him.",go board steam packet see number know face deck merry voice greet 
5,"""Hallo, Williams! here you are at last,"" said Duncan, seizing his hand. ""How have you enjoyed the holidays? It's so jolly to see you again.""",last say seize hand enjoy holiday jolly see 
6,"""So you're coming as a boarder,"" said Montagu, ""and to our noble house, too. Mind you stick up for it, old fellow. Come along, and let's watch whether the boats are bringing any more fellows; we shall be starting in a few minutes.""",come border say noble house mind stick old fellow come let watch boat bring more fellow start few minute 
7,"""Ha! there's Russell,"" said Eric, springing to the gangway, and warmly shaking his friend's hand as he came on board.",be say spring gangway shake friend hand come board 
8,"""Have your father and mother gone, Eric?"" said Russell, after a few minutes' talk.",have father mother go say few minute talk 
9,"""Yes,"" said Eric, turning away his head, and hastily brushing his eyes. ""They are on their way back to India.""",say turn head brush eye way 
10,"""I'm so sorry,"" said Russell; ""I don't think anyone has ever been so kind to me as they were.""",sorry say think kind 
11,"""And they loved you, Edwin, dearly, and told me, almost the last thing, that they hoped we should always be friends. Stop! they gave me something for you."" Eric opened his carpet-bag, and took out a little box carefully wrapped up, which he gave to Russell. It contained a pretty silver watch, and inside the case was engraved--""Edwin Russell, from the mother of his friend Eric.""",love tell last thing hope friend stop give open carpet bag take little box wrap give contain silver watch case engrave mother friend 
12,"The boy's eyes glistened with joyful surprise. ""How good they are,"" he said; ""I shall write and thank Mrs. Williams directly we get to Roslyn.""",boy eye glisten joyful surprise good say write thank get 
13,"They had a fine bright voyage, and arrived that night. Eric, as a new comer, was ushered at once into Dr. Rowlands' drawing-room, where the head master was sitting with his wife and children. His greeting was dignified, but not unkindly; and, on saying ""good night,"" he gave Eric a few plain words of affectionate advice.",have fine bright voyage arrive night new comer usher draw room head master sit wife child greeting dignified say good night give few plain word affectionate advice 
14,"At that moment Eric hardly cared for advice. He was full of life and spirits, brave, bright, impetuous, tingling with hope, in the flush and flower of boyhood. He bounded down the stairs, and in another minute entered the large room where all Dr. Rowlands' boarders assembled, and where most of them lived, except the few privileged sixth form, and other boys who had ""studies."" A cheer greeted his entrance into the room. By this time most of the Rowlandites knew him, and were proud to have him among their number. They knew that he was clever enough to get them credit in the school, and, what was better still, that he would be a capital accession of strength to the cricket and football. Except Barker, there was not one who had not a personal liking for him, and on this occasion even Barker was gracious.",moment care advice full life spirit brave bright impetuous tingle hope flush flower boyhood bound stair minute enter large room border assemble most live few privileged sixth form other boy have study cheer greet entrance room time most know proud have number know clever get credit school good capital accession strength cricket football be one have personal like occasion gracious 
15,"The room in which Eric found himself was large and high. At one end was a huge fire-place, and there was generally a throng of boys round the great iron fender, where, in cold weather, a little boy could seldom get. The large windows opened on the green playground; and iron bars prevented any exit through them. This large room, called ""the boarders' room,"" was the joint habitation of Eric and some thirty other boys; and at one side ran a range of shelves and drawers, where they kept their books and private property. There the younger Rowlandites breakfasted, dined, had tea, and, for the most part, lived. Here, too, they had to get through all such work as was not performed under direct supervision. How many and what varied scenes had not that room beheld! had those dumb walls any feeling, what worlds of life and experience they would have acquired! If against each boy's name, as it was rudely cut on the oak panels, could have been also cut the fate that had befallen him, the good that he had there learnt, the evil that he had there suffered--what _noble_ histories would the records unfold of honor and success, of baffled temptations and hard-won triumphs; what _awful_ histories of hopes blighted and habits learned, of wasted talents and ruined lives!",room find large high end huge fire place be throng boy great iron fender cold weather little boy get large window open green playground iron bar prevent exit large room call border room joint habitation other boy side run range shelf drawer keep book private property young breakfast dine have tea most part live have get such work perform direct supervision many varied scene have room beheld have dumb wall feeling world life experience acquire boy name cut oak panel cut fate befall good learn evil suffer _noble_ history record unfold honor success baffle temptation hard win triumph _awful_ history hope blight habit learn waste talent ruin life 
16,"The routine of school-life was on this wise:--At half-past seven the boys came down to prayers, which were immediately followed by breakfast. At nine they went into school, where they continued, with little interruption, till twelve. At one they dined, and, except on half-holidays, went into school again from two till five. The lock-up bell rang at dusk; at six o'clock they had tea--which was a repetition of breakfast, with leave to add to it whatever else they liked--and immediately after sat down to ""preparation,"" which lasted from seven till nine. During this time one of the masters was always in the room, who allowed them to read amusing books, or employ themselves in any other quiet way they liked, as soon as ever they had learnt their lessons for the following day. At nine Dr. Rowlands came in and read prayers, after which the boys were dismissed to bed.",routine school life wise half past boy come prayer follow breakfast go school continue little interruption dine half holiday go school lock bell ring dusk o'clock have tea repetition breakfast leave add else like sit preparation last time master room allow read amusing book employ other quiet way like learn lesson follow day come read prayer boy dismiss bed 
17,"The arrangement of the dormitories was peculiar. They were a suite of rooms, exactly the same size, each opening into the other; six on each side of a lavatory, which occupied the space between them, so that, when all the doors were open, you could see from one end of the whole range to the other. The only advantage of this arrangement was, that one master walking up and down could keep all the boys in order while they were getting into bed. About a quarter of an hour was allowed for this process, and then the master went along the rooms putting out the lights. A few of the ""study-boys"" were allowed to sit up till ten, and their bedrooms were elsewhere. The consequence was, that in these dormitories the boys felt perfectly secure from any interruption. There were only two ways by which a master could get at them; one up the great staircase, and through the lavatory; the other by a door at the extreme end of the range, which led into Dr. Rowlands' house, but was generally kept locked.",arrangement dormitory peculiar suite room same size open other side lavatory occupy space door open see end whole range other only advantage arrangement master walk keep boy order get bed quarter hour allow process master go room put light few study boy allow sit bedroom consequence dormitory boy feel secure interruption be way master get great staircase lavatory other door extreme end range lead house keep lock 
18,"In each dormitory slept four or five boys, distributed by their order in the school list, so that, in all the dormitories, there were nearly sixty; and of these a goodly number were, on Eric's arrival, collected in the boarders' room, the rest being in their studies, or in the classrooms which some were allowed to use in order to prevent too great a crowd in the room below.",dormitory sleep boy distribute order school list dormitory be goodly number arrival collect border room rest study classroom allow use order prevent great crowd room 
19,"At nine o'clock the prayer-bell rang. Immediately all the boarders took their seats for prayers, each with an open Bible before him; and when the school servants had also come in, Dr. Rowlands read a chapter, and offered up an extempore prayer. While reading, he generally interspersed a few pointed remarks or graphic explanations, and Eric learnt much in this simple way. The prayer, though short, was always well suited to the occasion, and calculated to carry with it the attention of the worshippers.",o'clock prayer bell ring border take seat prayer open school servant come read chapter offer extempore prayer read intersperse few point remark graphic explanation learn much simple way prayer short suit occasion calculate carry attention worshipper 
20,"Prayers over, the boys noisily dispersed to their bed rooms, and Eric found himself placed in a room immediately to the right of the lavatory, occupied by Duncan, Graham, Llewellyn, and two other boys named Bull and Attlay, all in the same form with himself They were all tired with their voyage, and the excitement of coming back to school, so that they did not talk much that night, and before long Eric was fast asleep, dreaming, dreaming, dreaming that he should have a very happy life at Roslyn school, and seeing himself win no end of distinctions, and make no end of new friends.",prayer boy disperse bed room find place room right lavatory occupy other boy name same form tired voyage excitement come school talk night fast asleep dreaming dreaming dreaming have happy life school see win end distinction make end new friend
