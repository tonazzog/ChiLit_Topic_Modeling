2,"When Ready arrived, he found them all plunged in such deep distress, that he did not consider it advisable to say anything.  The evening closed in; it was time to retire.  The countenance of Mr Seagrave was not only gloomy, but morose.  The hour for retiring to rest had long passed when Ready broke the silence by saying, ""Surely, you do not intend to sit up all night, Mr Seagrave?""",ready arrive find plunge such deep distress consider advisable say evening close time retire countenance gloomy morose hour retire rest pass ready break silence say intend sit night 
3,"""Oh, no! there's no use sitting up now,"" replied Mr Seagrave, rising up impatiently.  ""Come, my dear, let us go to bed.""",be use sit reply rise come dear let go bed 
4,"Mrs Seagrave rose, and retired behind the canvas screen.  Her husband seemed as if he was about to follow her, when Ready, without speaking, laid the Bible on the table before him.  Mr Seagrave did not appear to notice it; but William touched his father's arm, pointed to the book, and then went inside of the screen, and led out his mother.",rise retire canvas screen husband seem about follow ready speak lay table appear notice touch father arm point book go screen lead mother 
5,"""God forgive me!"" exclaimed Mr Seagrave.  ""In my selfishness and discontent I had forgotten--""",forgive exclaim selfishness discontent forget 
6,"""Yes, sir, you had forgotten those words, `Come unto me, all ye who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'""",sir forget word come weary heavy laden give rest 
7,"""I am ashamed of myself,"" said Mrs Seagrave, bursting into tears.",ashamed say burst tear 
8,"Mr Seagrave opened the Bible, and read the psalm.  As soon as he had closed the book, ""good night"" were all the words that passed, and they all retired to rest.",open read psalm close book good night word pass retire rest 
9,"During the night, the wind howled and the rain beat down.  The children slept soundly, but Mr and Mrs Seagrave, Ready, and William were awake during the whole of the night, listening to the storm, and occupied with their own thoughts.",night wind howl rain beat child sleep ready awake whole night listen storm occupy own thought 
10,"Ready was dressed before daylight, and out on the beach before the sun had risen.  The gale was at its height; and after a careful survey with his telescope, he could see nothing of the vessel.  He remained on the beach till breakfast-time, when he was summoned by William, and returned to the house.  He found Mr and Mrs Seagrave up, and more composed than they were the evening before; and they welcomed him warmly.",ready dress daylight beach sun rise gale height careful survey telescope see vessel remain beach breakfast time summon return house find compose evening welcome 
11,"""I fear, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""that you have no good news for us.""",fear ready say have good news 
12,"""No, sir; nor can you expect any good news until after the gale is over. The vessel could not remain here during the gale--that is certain; and there is no saying what the effects of the gale may be.  She may lie to, and not be far from us when the gale is over; or she may be obliged to scud before the gale, and run some hundred miles from us.  Then comes the next chance.  I think, by her running for the island, that she was short of water; the question is, then, whether she may not find it necessary to run for the port she is bound to, or water at some other place.  A captain of a vessel is bound to do his best for the owners. At the same time I do think, that if she can with propriety come back for us she will.  The question is, first, whether she can; and, secondly, whether the captain is a humane man, and will do so at his own inconvenience.""",sir expect good news gale vessel remain gale certain be say effect gale lie gale oblige scud gale run mile come next chance think running island short water question find necessary run port bind water other place captain vessel bind do good owner same time think propriety come question captain humane man do own inconvenience 
13,"""There is but poor comfort in all that,"" replied Mr Seagrave.",be poor comfort reply 
14,"""It is useless holding out false hopes, sir,"" replied Ready; ""but even if the vessel continues her voyage, we have much to be thankful for.""",useless hold false hope sir reply ready vessel continue voyage have much thankful 
15,"""In what, Ready?""",ready 
16,"""Why, sir, no one knew whether we were in existence or not, and probably we never should have been searched for; but now we have made it known, and by the ship's name on the flag they know who we are, and, if they arrive safe in port, will not fail to communicate the intelligence to your friends.  Is not that a great deal to be thankful for?  We may not be taken off by this vessel, but we have every hope that another will be sent out to us.""",sir know existence search make know ship name flag know arrive safe port fail communicate intelligence friend great deal thankful take vessel have hope send 
17,"""Very true, Ready; I ought to have seen that before; but my despair and disappointment were yesterday so great, that it almost took away my reason.""",true ready see despair disappointment yesterday great take reason 
18,"The gale continued during the day, and showed no symptoms of abatement, when they again retired for the night.  The following day Ready was up early, as usual, and William accompanied him to the beach.",gale continue day show symptom abatement retire night follow day ready usual accompany beach 
19,"""I don't think that it blows so hard as it did, Ready.""",think blow ready 
20,"""No, William, it does not; the gale is breaking, and by night, I have no doubt, will be over.  It is, however, useless looking for the vessel, as she must be a long way from this.  It would take her a week, perhaps, to come back to us if she was to try to do so, unless the wind should change to the northward or westward.""",gale break night have doubt useless look vessel long way take week come try do wind change northward 
21,"""Ready!  Ready!"" exclaimed William, pointing to the south-east part of the reef; ""what is that?  Look! it's a boat.""",ready ready exclaim point south east part reef look boat 
22,"Ready put his telescope to his eye.  ""It's a canoe, William, and there are people in it.""",ready put telescope eye canoe be person 
23,"""Why, where can they have come from?  See! they are among the breakers; they will be lost.  Let us go towards them, Ready.""",come see breaker lose let go ready 
24,"They hastened along the beach to the spot nearest to where the canoe was tossing on the surf, and watched it as it approached the shore.",hasten beach spot near canoe toss surf watch approach shore 
25,"""William, this canoe must have been blown off from the large island, which lies out there;"" and Ready again looked through his telescope: ""there are two people in it, and they are islanders.  Poor things! they struggle hard for their lives, and seem much exhausted; but they have passed through the most dangerous part of the reef.""",canoe blow large island lie ready look telescope be person islander poor thing struggle life seem exhaust pass dangerous part reef 
26,"""Yes,"" replied William, ""they will soon be in smoother water; but the surf on the beach is very heavy.""",reply smooth water surf beach heavy 
27,"""They won't mind that, if their strength don't fail them--they manage the canoe beautifully.""",mind strength fail manage canoe 
28,"During this conversation the canoe had rapidly come towards the land. In a moment or two afterwards, it passed through the surf and grounded on the beach.  The two people in it had just strength enough left to paddle through the surf, and then they dropped down in the bottom of the canoe, quite exhausted.",conversation canoe come land moment pass surf ground beach person have strength leave paddle surf drop bottom canoe exhaust 
29,"""Let's drag the canoe higher up, William.  Poor creatures! they are nearly dead.""",let drag canoe high poor creature dead 
30,"While dragging it up, Ready observed that the occupants were both women: their faces were tattooed all over; otherwise they were young, and might have been good-looking.",drag ready observe occupant woman face tattooe young good look 
31,"""Shall I run up and get something for them, Ready?""",run get ready 
32,"""Do, William; ask Juno to give you some of whatever there is for breakfast; anything warm.""",do ask give be breakfast warm 
33,"William soon returned with some thin oatmeal porridge, which Juno had been preparing for breakfast; and a few spoonfuls being forced down the throats of the two natives they gradually revived.  William then left Ready, and went up to acquaint his father and mother with this unexpected event.",return thin oatmeal porridge prepare breakfast few spoonful force throat native revive leave ready go acquaint father mother unexpected event 
34,"William soon returned with Mr Seagrave, and as the women were now able to sit up, they hauled up the canoe as far as they could, to prevent her being beat to pieces.  They found nothing in the canoe, except a piece of matting and the two paddles which had been used by the natives.",return woman able sit haul canoe prevent beat piece find canoe piece matting paddle use native 
35,"""You see, sir,"" said Ready, ""it is very clear that these two poor women, having been left in charge of the canoe, have been blown off from the shore of one of the islands to the south-east; they must have been contending with the gale ever since the day before yesterday, and, as it appears, without food or water.  It's a mercy that they gained this island.""",see sir say ready clear poor woman leave charge canoe blow shore island south east contend gale day yesterday appear food water mercy gain island 
36,"""It is so,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""but to tell the truth, I am not over pleased at their arrival.  It proves what we were not sure of before, that we have very near neighbours, who may probably pay us a very unwelcome visit.""",reply tell truth pleased arrival prove sure have near neighbour pay unwelcome visit 
37,"""That may be, sir,"" replied Ready; ""still these two poor creatures being thrown on shore here does not make the matter worse, or the danger greater.  Perhaps it may turn to our advantage; for if these women learn to speak English before any other islanders visit us, they will interpret for us, and be the means, perhaps, of saving our lives.""",sir reply ready poor creature throw shore make matter bad danger great turn advantage woman learn speak other islander visit interpret means save life 
38,"""Would their visit be so dangerous, then, Ready?""",visit dangerous ready 
39,"""Why, sir, a savage is a savage, and, like a child, wishes to obtain whatever he sees; especially he covets what he may turn to use, such as iron, etcetera.  If they came, and we concealed a portion, and gave up the remainder of our goods, we might escape; but still there is no trusting to them, and I would infinitely prefer defending ourselves against numbers to trusting to their mercy.""",sir savage savage child wish obtain see covet turn use such iron etcetera come conceal portion give remainder goods escape be trusting prefer defend number trust mercy 
40,"""But how can we defend ourselves against a multitude?""",defend multitude 
41,"""We must be prepared, sir: if we can fortify ourselves, with our muskets we would be more than a match for hundreds.""",prepare sir fortify musket more match hundred 
42,"Mr Seagrave turned away.  After a pause he said, ""It is not very pleasant to be now talking of defending ourselves against savages, when we hoped two days ago to be leaving the island.  Oh, that that brig would make its appearance again!""",turn pause say pleasant talk defend savage hope day leave island brig make appearance 
43,"""The wind is going down fast, sir,"" observed Ready; ""it will be fine weather before the evening.  We may look out for her; at all events, for the next week I shall not give up all hopes.""",wind go sir observe ready fine weather evening look event next week give hope 
44,"""A whole week, Ready!  Alas! how true it is, that hope deferred maketh the heart sick.""",whole week ready true hope deferre maketh heart sick 
45,"""It is a severe trial, Mr Seagrave; but we must submit when we are chastened.  We had better get these poor creatures up to the house, and let them recover themselves.""",severe trial submit chasten get poor creature house let recover 
46,"Ready then beckoned to them to get on their feet, which they both did, although with some difficulty.  He then went in advance, making a sign for them to follow; they understood him, and made the attempt, but were so weak, that they would have fallen if they had not been supported by Mr Seagrave and William.",ready beckon get foot difficulty go advance make sign follow understand make attempt weak fall support 
47,"It required a long time for them to arrive at the house.  Mrs Seagrave, who knew what had happened, received them very kindly, and Juno had a mess ready, which she put before them.  They ate a little and then lay down, and were soon sound asleep.",require long time arrive house know happen receive have mess ready put eat little lay sound asleep 
48,"""It is fortunate for us that they are women,"" observed Mr Seagrave: ""we should have had great difficulty had they been men.""",fortunate woman observe have great difficulty man 
49,"""Yes, sir,"" replied Ready; ""but still we must not trust women too much at first, for they are savages.""",sir reply ready trust woman first savage 
50,"""Where shall we put them to-night, Ready?""",put night ready 
51,"""Why, sir, I have been thinking about that.  I wish we had a shed close to us; but as we have not, we must let them sleep in the storehouse.""",sir think wish have shed close let sleep storehouse 
52,"We must now pass over a space of fifteen days, in which there was nothing done.  The expectation of the vessel returning was still alive, although each day decreased these hopes.  Every morning Ready and William were at the beach with the telescope, and the whole of the day was passed in surmises, hopes, and fears.  In fact, the appearance of the vessel and the expectation of leaving the island had completely overturned all the regularity and content of our island party.  No other subject was broached--not any of the work proposed was begun, as it was useless to do anything if they were to leave the island.  After the first week had passed, they felt that every day their chances were more adverse, and at the end of the fortnight all hopes were very unwillingly abandoned.",pass space day be do expectation vessel return alive day decrease hope morning ready beach telescope whole day pass surmise hope fear fact appearance vessel expectation leave island overturn regularity content island party other subject broach work propose begin useless do leave island first week pass feel day chance adverse end fortnight hope abandon 
53,"The Indian women had, in the meantime, recovered their fatigues, and appeared to be very mild and tractable.  Whatever they were able to do, they did cheerfully, and had already gained a few words of English.  The party to explore was again talked over, and arranged for the following Monday, when a new misfortune fell on them, which disconcerted all their arrangements.",indian woman meantime recover fatigue appear mild tractable able do do gain few word party explore talk arrange follow new misfortune fall disconcert arrangement 
54,"On the Saturday morning, when Ready, as usual, went his rounds, as he walked along the beach, he perceived that the Indian canoe was missing. It had been hauled up clear of the water, so that it could not have floated away.  Ready's heart misgave him; he looked through his telescope in the direction of the large island, and thought he could distinguish a speck on the water at a great distance.  As he was thus occupied, William came down to him.",morning ready usual go round walk beach perceive indian canoe miss haul clear water float ready heart misgave look telescope direction large island think distinguish speck water great distance occupy come 
55,"""William,"" said Ready, ""I fear those island women have escaped in their canoe.  Run up, and see if they are in the outhouse, or anywhere else, and let me know as soon as you can.""",say ready fear island woman escape canoe run see outhouse else let know 
56,"William in a few minutes returned, breathless, stating that the women were not to be found, and that they had evidently carried away with them a quantity of the large nails and other pieces of iron which were in the small kegs in the storehouse.",few minute return breathless state woman find carry quantity large nail other piece iron small keg storehouse 
57,"""This is bad, William; this is worse than the vessel not coming back.""",bad bad vessel come 
58,"""Why, we can do without them, Ready.""",do ready 
59,"""Yes; but when they get back to their own people, and show them the iron they have brought with them, and describe how much more there is to be had, depend upon it, we shall have a visit from them in numbers, that they may obtain more.  I ought to have known better than to leave the canoe here.  We must go and consult with Mr Seagrave, for the sooner we begin to work now, the better.""",get own person show iron bring describe more be have depend have visit number obtain more know good leave canoe go consult begin work good 
60,"They communicated the intelligence to Mr Seagrave when they were outside.  He at once perceived their danger, so they held a council, and came to the following resolutions:--",communicate intelligence perceive danger hold council come follow resolution 
61,"That it would be necessary that they should immediately stockade the storehouse, so as to render it impossible for any one to get in; and that, as soon as the fortification was complete, the storehouse should be turned into their dwelling-house; and such stores as could not be put within the stockade should be removed to their present house, or concealed in the cocoa-nut grove.",necessary stockade storehouse render impossible one get fortification complete storehouse turn dwelling house such store put stockade remove present house conceal cocoa nut grove 
62,"It was decided that nothing should be begun on that day, Saturday; that Sunday should be spent in devout prayer for help and encouragement from the Almighty, who would do towards them as his wisdom should ordain; and that on Monday, with the blessing of God, they would recommence their labour.",decide begin day spend devout prayer help encouragement do wisdom ordain blessing recommence labour 
63,"""I don't know why, but I feel more courage now that there is a prospect of danger, than I felt when there was little or none,"" said Mrs Seagrave.",know feel courage be prospect danger feel be little say 
64,"""How little do we know what the day may bring forth!"" exclaimed Mr Seagrave.  ""How joyful were our anticipations when the vessel hoisted her colours! we felt sure that we were to be taken off the island.  The same gale that drove the vessel away brought down to us the island women.  The fair weather after the gale, which we hoped would have brought back the vessel to our succour, on the contrary enabled the women to escape in the canoe, and make known our existence to those who may come to destroy us.  How true it is that man plans in vain; and that it is only by the Almighty will and pleasure that he can obtain his ends!""",little know day bring exclaim joyful anticipation vessel hoist colour feel sure take island same gale drive vessel bring island woman fair weather gale hope bring vessel succour contrary enable woman escape canoe make know existence come destroy true man plan vain will pleasure obtain end
