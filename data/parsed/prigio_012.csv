1,CHAPTER XI. _The Battle_,
2,"IT was an awful sight to behold! When the Remora heard the name of the Firedrake, his hated enemy, he slipped with wonderful speed from the cleft of the mountain into the valley. On and on and on he poured over rock and tree, as if a frozen river could slide downhill; on and on, till there were miles of him stretching along the valley--miles of the smooth-ribbed, icy creature, crawling and slipping forwards. The green trees dropped their leaves as he advanced; the birds fell down dead from the sky, slain by his frosty breath! But, fast as the Remora stole forward, the Firedrake came quicker yet, flying and clashing his fiery wings. At last they were within striking distance; and the Firedrake, stooping from the air, dashed with his burning horns and flaming feet slap into the body of the Remora.",awful sight behold hear name hate enemy slip wonderful speed cleft mountain valley pour rock tree freeze river slide be mile stretch valley mile smooth ribbed icy creature crawl slip forward green tree drop leave advance bird fall dead sky slain frosty breath steal come quick fly clash fiery wing last strike distance stoop air dash burning horn flame foot slap body 
3,"Then there rose a steam so dreadful, such a white yet fiery vapour of heat, that no one who had not the prince’s magic glass could have seen what happened. With horrible grunts and roars the Firedrake tried to burn his way right through the flat body of the Remora, and to chase him to his cleft in the rock. But the Remora, hissing terribly, and visibly melting away in places, yet held his ground; and the prince could see his cold white folds climbing slowly up the hoofs of the Firedrake--up and up, till they reached his knees, and the great burning beast roared like a hundred bulls with the pain. Then up the Firedrake leaped, and hovering on his fiery wings, he lighted in the midst of the Remora’s back, and dashed into it with his horns. But the flat, cruel head writhed backwards, and, slowly bending over on itself, the wounded Remora slid greedily to fasten again on the limbs of the Firedrake.",rise steam dreadful white fiery vapour heat prince magic glass see happen horrible grunt roar try burn way flat body chase cleft rock hiss melt place hold ground prince see cold white fold climb hoof reach knee great burning beast roar bull pain leap hover fiery wing light midst dash horn flat cruel head writh bending wound slide fast limb 
4,"Meanwhile, the prince, safe on his hill, was lunching on the loaf and the cold tongue he had brought with him.",prince safe hill lunch loaf cold tongue bring 
5,"“Go it, Remora! Go it, Firedrake! you’re gaining. Give it him, Remora!”  he shouted in the wildest excitement.",go go gain give shout wild excitement 
6,"Nobody had ever seen such a battle; he had it all to himself, and he never enjoyed anything more. He hated the Remora so much, that he almost wished the Firedrake could beat it; for the Firedrake was the more natural beast of the pair. Still, he was alarmed when he saw that the vast flat body of the Remora was now slowly coiling backwards, backwards, into the cleft below the hill; while a thick wet mist showed how cruelly it had suffered. But the Firedrake, too, was in an unhappy way; for his legs were now cold and black, his horns were black also, though his body, especially near the heart, glowed still like red-hot iron.",see battle have enjoy more hate wish beat natural beast pair alarm see vast flat body coil cleft hill thick wet mist show suffer unhappy way leg cold black horn black body heart glow red hot iron 
7,"“Go it, Remora!” cried the prince: “his legs are giving way; he’s groggy on his pins! One more effort, and he won’t be able to move!”",go cry prince leg give way groggy pin more effort able move 
8,"Encouraged by this advice, the white, slippery Remora streamed out of his cavern again, more and more of him uncoiling, as if the mountain were quite full of him. He had lost strength, no doubt: for the steam and mist went up from him in clouds, and the hissing of his angry voice grew fainter; but so did the roars of the Firedrake. Presently they sounded more like groans; and at last the Remora slipped up his legs above the knees, and fastened on his very heart of fire. Then the Firedrake stood groaning like a black bull, knee-deep in snow; and still the Remora climbed and climbed.",encourage advice white slippery stream cavern more more uncoil mountain full lose strength doubt steam mist go cloud hissing angry voice grow fainter do roar sound groan last slip leg knee fasten very heart fire stand groan black bull knee deep snow climb climb 
9,"“Go it now, Firedrake!” shouted the prince; for he knew that if the Remora won, it would be too cold for him to draw near the place, and cut off the Firedrake’s head and tail.",go shout prince know win cold draw place cut head tail 
10,"“Go it, Drake! he’s slackening!” cried the prince again; and the brave Firedrake made one last furious effort, and rising on his wings, dropped just on the spine of his enemy.",go slacken cry prince brave make last furious effort rise wing drop spine enemy 
11,"The wounded Remora curled back his head again on himself, and again crawled, steaming terribly, towards his enemy. But the struggle was too much for the gallant Remora. The flat, cruel head moved slower; the steam from his thousand wounds grew fiercer; and he gently breathed his last just as the Firedrake, too, fell over and lay exhausted. With one final roar, like the breath of a thousand furnaces, the Firedrake expired.",wound curl head crawl steam enemy struggle much gallant flat cruel head move slow steam wound grow fiercer breathe last fall lay exhaust final roar breath furnace expire 
12," The prince, watching from the hill-top, could scarcely believe that these two _awful scourges of Nature_, which had so long devastated his country, were actually dead. But when he had looked on for half-an-hour, and only a river ran where the Remora had been, while the body of the Firedrake lay stark and cold, he hurried to the spot.",prince watch hill top believe _awful scourge devastate country dead look half hour river run body lay stark cold hurry spot 
13,"Drawing the sword of sharpness, he hacked off, at two blows, the iron head and the tail of the Firedrake. They were a weary weight to carry; but in a few strides of the shoes of swiftness he was at his castle, where he threw down his burden, and nearly fainted with excitement and fatigue.",draw sword sharpness hack blow iron head tail weary weight carry few stride shoe swiftness castle throw burden faint excitement fatigue 
14,"But the castle clock struck half-past seven; dinner was at eight, and the poor prince crawled on hands and knees to the garret. Here he put on the wishing-cap; wished for a pint of champagne, a hot bath, and his best black velvet and diamond suit. In a moment these were provided; he bathed, dressed, drank a glass of wine, packed up the head and tail of the Firedrake; sat down on the flying carpet, and knocked at the door of the English Ambassador as the clocks were striking eight’ in Gluckstein.",castle clock strike half past dinner poor prince crawl hand knee garret put wish cap wish pint champagne hot bath good black velvet diamond suit moment provide bath dress drink glass wine pack head tail sit fly carpet knock door english clock strike

16,"The prince was received at the door by a stout porter and led into the hall, where _several_ butlers met him, and he laid the mortal remains of the Firedrake under the cover of the flying carpet.",prince receive door stout porter lead hall _several_ butler meet lay mortal remains cover fly carpet 
17,"Then he was led upstairs, and he made his bow to the pretty lady, who, of course, made him a magnificent courtesy. She seemed prettier and kinder than ever. The prince was so happy, that he never noticed how something went wrong about the dinner. The ambassador looked about, and seemed to miss someone, and spoke in a low voice to one of the servants, who answered also in a low voice, and what he said seemed to displease the ambassador. But the prince was so busy in talking to his lady, and in eating his dinner too, that he never observed anything unusual. He had _never_ been at such a pleasant dinner!",lead make bow pretty lady course make magnificent courtesy seem pretty kind prince happy notice go wrong dinner ambassador look seem miss speak low voice servant answer low voice say seem displease ambassador prince busy talk lady eat dinner observe unusual pleasant dinner
