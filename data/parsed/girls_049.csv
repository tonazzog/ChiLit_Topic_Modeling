2,"Hester dragged her startled and rather unwilling companion in through the front entrance, past some agitated-looking servants who stood about in the hall, and through the velvet curtains into Mrs Willis's boudoir.",drag startle unwilling companion front entrance agitated look servant stand hall velvet curtain boudoir 
3,"The Misses Bruce were there, and Mrs Willis in her bonnet and cloak was hastily packing some things into a basket.",bonnet cloak pack thing basket 
4,"""I--I must speak to you,"" said Hester, going up to her governess. ""Susan and I have got something to say, and we must say it here, now at once?""",speak say go governess get say say 
5,"""No, not now, Hester,"" replied Mrs Willis, looking for a moment into her pupil's agitated face.  ""Whatever you and Susan Drummond have to tell cannot be listened to by me at this moment.  I have not an instant to lose.""",reply look moment pupil agitated face have tell listen moment have instant lose 
6,"""You are going to Annie?"" asked Hester.",go ask 
7,"""Yes; don't keep me.  Good-bye, my dears; good-bye.""",keep good dear good bye

9,"""Take us with you, take Susy and me with you--we must we must see Annie before she dies.""",take take see die 
10,"""Hush, my child,"" said Mrs Willis very quietly; ""try to calm yourself. Whatever you have got to say shall be listened to later on--now moments are precious, and I cannot attend to you.  Calm yourself, Hester, and thank God for your dear little sister's safety.  Prepare yourself to receive her, for the carriage which takes me to Annie will bring little Nan home.""",child say try calm get say listen moment precious attend calm thank dear little sister safety prepare receive carriage take bring little home 
11,"Mrs Willis left the room, and Hester threw herself on hen knees and covered her face with her trembling hands.  Presently she was aroused by a light touch on her arm; it was Susan Drummond.",leave room throw hen knee cover face tremble hand arouse light touch arm 
12,"""I may go now, I suppose, Hester?  You are not quite determined to make a fool of me, are you?""",go suppose determined make fool 
13,"""I have determined to expose you, you coward, you mean, mean girl!"" answered Hester, springing to her feet.  ""Come, I have no idea of letting you go.  Mrs Willis won't listen--we will find Mr Everard.""",determine expose coward mean mean girl answer spring foot come have idea let go listen find 
14,"Whether Susan would really have gone with Hester remains to be proved, but just at that moment all possibility of retreat was cut away from her by Miss Agnes Bruce, who quietly entered Mrs Willis's private sitting-room, followed by the very man Hester was about to seek.",go remain prove moment possibility retreat cut enter private sitting room follow very man about seek 
15,"""I thought it best, my dear,"" she said, turning apologetically to Hester, ""to go at once for our good clergyman; you can tell him all that is in your heart, and I will leave you.  Before I go, however.  I should like to tell you how I found Annie and little Nan.""",think good dear say turn go good clergyman tell heart leave go like tell find little 
16,"Hester made no answer; just for a brief moment she raised her eyes to Miss Agnes's kind face, then they sought the floor.",make answer brief moment raise eye kind face seek floor 
17,"""The story can be told in a few words, dear,"" said the little lady.  ""A work-woman of the name of Williams, whom my sister and I have employed for years, and who lives near Oakley, called on us this morning to apologise for not being able to finish some needlework.  She told us that she had a sick child, and also a little girl of three, in her house.  She said she had found the child, in ragged gipsy garments, fainting in a field.  She took her into her house, and, on undressing her, found that she was no true gipsy, but that her face and hands and arms had been dyed; she said the little one had been treated in a similar manner.  Jane's suspicions and mine were instantly roused, and we went back with the woman to Oakley, and round, as we had anticipated, that the children were little Nan and Annie.  The sad thing is that Annie is in high fever, and knows no one.  We waited there until the doctor arrived, who spoke very, very seriously of her case.  Little Nan is well, and asked for you.""",story tell few word dear say little lady work woman name sister employ year live call morning apologise able finish needlework tell have sick child little girl house say find child ragged gipsy garment fainting field take house undress find true gipsy face hand arm dyed say little one treat similar manner suspicion rouse go woman anticipate child little sad thing high fever know wait doctor arrive speak case little well ask 
18,"With these last words Miss Agnes Bruce softly left the room, closing the door after her.",last word leave room close door 
19,"""Now, Susan,"" said Hester, without an instant's pause; ""come, let us tell Mr Everard of our wickedness.  Oh, sir,"" she added, raising her eyes to the clergyman's face, ""if Annie dies I shall go mad.  Oh, I cannot, cannot bear life if Annie dies!""",say instant pause come let tell wickedness sir add raise eye clergyman face die go mad bear life die 
20,"""Tell me what is wrong, my poor child,"" said Mr Everard.  He laid his hand on her shoulder, and gradually and skillfully drew from the agitated and miserable girl the story of her sin, of her cowardice, and of her deep, though until now unavailing repentance.  How from the first she had hated and disliked Annie; how unjustly she had felt toward her; how she had longed and hoped Annie was guilty; and how, when at last the clew was put into her hands to prove Annie's absolute innocence, she had determined not to use it.",tell wrong poor child say lay hand shoulder draw agitated miserable girl story sin cowardice deep unavail repentance first hate dislike feel long hope guilty last clew put hand prove absolute innocence determine use 
21,"""From the day Nan was lost,"" continued Hester, ""it has been all agony and all repentance; but, oh, I was too proud to tell!  I was too proud to humble myself to the very dust!""",day lose continue agony repentance proud tell proud humble very dust 
22,"""But not now,"" said the clergyman very gently.",say clergyman 
23,"""No, no; not now.  I care for nothing now in all the world except that Annie may live.""",care world live 
24,"""You don't mind the fact that Mrs Willis and all your school-fellows must know of this, and must--must judge you accordingly?""",mind fact school fellow know judge 
25,"""They can't think worse of me than I think of myself.  I only want Annie to live.""",think bad think want live 
26,"""No, Hester,"" answered Mr Everard, ""you want more than that--you want far more than that.  It may be that God will take Annie Forest away.  We cannot tell.  With Him alone are the issues of life or death.  What you really want, my child, is the forgiveness of the little girl you have wronged, and the forgiveness of your Father in heaven.""  Hester began to sob wildly.",answer want more want more take tell issue life death want child forgiveness little girl wrong forgiveness father heaven begin sob 
27,"""If--if she dies--may I see her first?"" she gasped.",die see gasp 
28,"""Yes; I will try and promise you that.  Now, will you go to your room? I must speak to Miss Drummond alone; she is a far worse culprit than you.""",try promise go room speak bad culprit 
29,"Mr Everard opened the door for Hester, who went silently out.",open door go 
30,"""Meet me in the chapel to-night,"" he whispered low in her car, ""I will talk with you and pray with you there.""",meet chapel night whisper car talk pray 
31,"He closed the door, and came back to Susan.",close door come 
32,"All throughout this interview his manner had been very gentle to Hester; but the clergyman could be stern, and there was a gleam of very righteous anger in his eyes as he turned to the sullen girl who leaned heavily against the table.",interview manner gentle clergyman stern be gleam righteous anger eye turn sullen girl learn table 
33,"""This narrative of Hester Thornton's is, of course, quite true, Miss Drummond?""",narrative course true 
34,"""Oh, yes; there seems to be no use in denying that,"" said Susan.",seem be use deny say 
35,"""I must insist on your telling me the exact story of your sin.  There is no use in your attempting to deny anything; only the utmost candour on your part can now save you from being publicly expelled.""",insist tell exact story sin be use attempt deny utmost candour part save expel 
36,"""I am willing to tell,"" answered Susan.  ""I meant no harm; it was done as a bit of fun.  I had a cousin at home who was very clever at drawing caricatures, and I happened to have nothing to do one day, and I was alone in Annie's bedroom, and I thought I'd like to see what she kept in her desk.  I always had a fancy for collecting odd keys, and I found one on my bunch which fitted her desk exactly.  I opened it, and I found such a smart little caricature of Mrs Willis.  I sent the caricature to my cousin, and begged of her to make an exact copy of it.  She did so, and I put Annie's back in her desk, and pasted the other into Cecil's book.  I didn't like Dora Russell, and I wrapped up the sweeties in her theme; but I did the other for pure fun, for I knew Cecil would be so shocked; but I never guessed the blame would fall on Annie.  When I found it did, I felt inclined to tell once or twice, but it seemed too much trouble, and, besides, I knew Mrs Willis would punish me, and, of course, I didn't wish that.",willing tell answer mean harm do bit fun have cousin home clever draw caricature happen have do day alone bedroom think like see keep desk have fancy collect odd key find bunch fit desk open find smart little caricature send caricature cousin begg make exact copy do put back desk paste other book like wrap sweety theme do other pure fun know shocked guess blame fall find feel inclined tell seem much trouble know punish course wish 
37,"""Dora Russell was always very nasty to me, and when I found she was putting on such airs, and pretending she could write such a grand essay for the prize, I thought I'd take down her pride a bit.  I went to her desk, and I got some of the rough copy of the thing she was calling `The River,' and I sent it off to my cousin, and my cousin made up such a ridiculous paper, and she hit off Dora's writing to the life, and, of course, I had to put it into Dora's desk and tear up her real copy.  It was very unlucky Hester being in the room.  Of course I never guessed that, or I wouldn't have gone.  That was the night we all went with Annie to the fairies' field.  I never meant to get Hester into a scrape, nor Annie either, for that matter; but, of course, I couldn't be expected to tell on myself.""",nasty find put such air pretend write grand essay prize think take pride bit go desk get rough copy thing call send cousin cousin make ridiculous paper hit writing life course have put desk tear real copy unlucky room course guess go night go fairy field mean get scrape matter course expect tell 
38,"Susan related her story in her usual monotonous and singsong voice. There was no trace of apparent emotion on her face, or of regret in her tones.  When she had finished speaking Mr Everard was absolutely silent.",relate story usual monotonous singsong voice be trace apparent emotion face regret tone finish speak silent 
39,"""I took a great deal of trouble,"" continued Susan, after a pause, in a slightly fretful key.  ""It was really nothing but a joke, and I don't see why such a fuss should have been made.  I know I lost a great deal of sleep trying to manage that twine business round my foot.  I don't think I shall trouble myself playing any more tricks upon school-girls-- they are not worth it.""",take great deal trouble continue pause fretful key joke see fuss make know lose great deal sleep try manage twine business foot think trouble play more trick school girl worth 
40,"""You'll never play any more tricks on these girls,"" said Mr Everard, rising to his feet, and suddenly filling the room and reducing Susan to an abject silence by the ring of his stern, deep voice.  ""I take it upon me, in the absence of your mistress, to pronounce your punishment.  You leave Lavender House in disgrace this evening.  Miss Good will take you home, and explain to your parents the cause of your dismissal.  You are not to see _any_ of your school-fellows again.  Your meanness, your cowardice, your sin require no words on my part to deepen their vileness.  Through pure wantonness you have cast a cruel shadow on an innocent young life.  If that girl dies, you indeed are not blameless in the cause of her early removal, for through you her heart and spirit were broken.  Miss Drummond, I pray God you may at least repent and be sorry.  There are some people mentioned in the Bible who are spoken of as past feeling.  Wretched girl, while there is yet time, pray that you may not belong to them.  Now I must leave you, but I shall lock you in. Miss Good will come for you in about an hour to take you away.""",play more trick girl say rise foot fill room reduce abject silence ring stern deep voice take absence mistress pronounce punishment leave disgrace evening take explain parent cause dismissal see school fellow meanness cowardice sin require word part deepen vileness pure wantonness cast cruel shadow innocent young life girl die blameless cause early removal heart spirit break pray least repent sorry be person mention speak past feeling wretch girl be time pray belong leave lock come hour take 
41,"Susan Drummond sank down on the nearest seat, and began to cry softly; one or two pin-pricks from Mr Everard's stern words may possibly have reached her shallow heart--no one can tell.  She left Lavender House that evening, and none of the girls who had lived with her as their school-mate heard of her again.",sink near seat begin cry pin-prick stern word reach shallow heart tell leave evening girl live school mate hear
