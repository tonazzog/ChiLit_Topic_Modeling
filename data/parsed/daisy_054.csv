5,"Four of the young gentlemen were to walk across to Abbotstoke and dine at the Grange; and Tom, who, reasoning from analogy, had sent on his black tie and agate studs, was so dismally disconcerted on finding that Norman treated his own going as a matter of course, that Richard, whose chief use of his right of primogeniture was to set himself aside, discovered that he was wanted at home, and that Tom would be much better at the Grange, offering, at the same time, to send Norman’s dressing things by Dr. Spencer.",young gentleman walk dine reason analogy send black tie agate stud disconcert find treat own go matter course chief use right primogeniture set discover want home good offer same time send dress thing

7,"“Tom would have had to lend him the precious studs.”--“He would not have had them; who would wear imitation?” “I say, Tom, what did you give for them?” “Better ask what the Jew gave for them, that bought them at Windsor Fair; not a bad imitation, either--pity they weren’t Malachite; but, no doubt, the Jew thought green would be personal.” “As if they had any business to talk, who didn’t know a respectable stud when they saw it--Harry, especially, with his hat set on the back of his head, like a sailor on the stage”--(a leap to set it to rights--a skirmish, knocking Tom nearly into the ditch). “Fine experience of the stage--all came from Windsor Fair.” “Ay, Hector might talk, but didn’t he pay a shilling to see the Irish giant. He wouldn’t confess, but it was a famous take in--giant had potatoes in his shoes.” “Not he; he was seven feet ten high.” “Ay, when he stood upon a stool--Hector would swallow anything--even the lady of a million postage stamps had not stuck in his throat--he had made Margaret collect for her.” “And, had not Tom, himself, got a bottle of ointment to get the red out of his hair?”--(great fury). “His hair wasn’t red--didn’t want to change the colour--not half so red as Hector’s own.” “What was it then? lively auburn?” But for fear of Norman’s losing his bearings, Harry would fetch a carrot, to compare. “Better colour than theirs could ever be.” “Then what was the ointment for? to produce whiskers? that was the reason Tom oiled himself like a Loyalty islander--his hair was so shiny, that Harry recommended a top-knot, like theirs, etc.”",have lend precious stud have wear imitation say give ask give buy bad imitation pity think green personal have business talk know respectable stud see hat set back head sailor stage leap set right skirmish knock ditch fine experience stage come talk pay shilling see irish giant confess famous take giant have potato shoe foot high stand stool swallow lady postage stamp stick throat make collect get bottle ointment get red hair great fury hair red want change colour half red own lively fear lose bearing fetch carrot compare good colour ointment produce whisker reason oil islander hair shiny recommend top knot etc. 
8,"Norman was, like the others, in such towering glee, and took so full a share of the witticisms, that were the more noisily applauded, the worse they were, that Harry suggested that “old June had lost his way, and found his spirits in Drydale--he must have met with a private grog-shop in the plantations--would not Tom confess”--“not he; it was all in private. He thought it was laughing-gas, or the reaction of being fried all the morning, holding forth in that Town Hall. He had longed to make a speech himself--no end of the good it would have done the old stagers to come out with something to the purpose.

18,"Norman tried to call his companions to order, for they were close upon the village, and he began to tax himself with unbecoming levity; the effect of spirits pitched rather low, which did not easily find their balance, under unwonted exhilaration, but Harry’s antics were less easily repressed than excited, and if Tom had not heard the Grange clock strike half-past six, and had not been afraid of not having time to array himself, and watch over Harry’s neckcloth, they would hardly have arrived in reasonable time. Dr. May had gone home, and there was no one in the drawing-room; but, as Norman was following the boys upstairs, Flora opened her sitting-room door, and attracted his attention by silently putting her cold fingers into his hand, and drawing him into the room.",try call companion order close village begin tax unbecoming levity effect spirit pitch low find balance unwonted exhilaration antic repress excite hear clock strike half past afraid have time array watch neckcloth arrive reasonable time go be draw room follow boy open sitting room door attract attention put cold finger hand draw room

The whole day has been a strange intermixture.”",sigh shake head say gentle considerate think fresh pain day tell whole day strange intermixture 
29,"“The two strands of joy and grief have been very closely twisted,” said Norman. “That rose is shedding its fragrant leaves in its glory, and there is much that should have chastened the overflowing gladness of to-day.”",strand joy grief twist say rose shed fragrant leave glory be much chasten overflow gladness day

48,"“The purpose was not inspired at first by the highest motive,” said Norman; “but it brought me peace, and, after the kind of dedication that I inwardly made of myself in my time of trouble, it would take some weighty reason, amounting to a clear duty, or physical impossibility, to make me think I ought to turn back. I believe”--the tears rose to his eyes, and he brought out the words with difficulty--“that, if this greatest of all joys were likely to hinder me from my calling, I ought to seek strength to regard it as a temptation, and to forgo it.”",purpose inspire first high motive say bring peace kind dedication make time trouble take weighty reason amount clear duty physical impossibility make think turn believe tear rise eye bring word difficulty great joy likely hinder calling seek strength regard temptation forgo 
49,"“You ought, if it were so,” said Meta, nevertheless holding him tighter. “I could not bear to keep back a soldier. If this were last year, and I had any tie or duty here, it would be very hard. But no one needs me, and if the health I have always had be continued to me, I don’t think I shall be much in the way.

53,“Then you did say something like it?”,say 
54,"“No, but--but--In short, Meta, these sailors’ imaginations go to great lengths. Harry had guessed more than I knew myself, before he had sailed, and taxed me with it. It was a subject I could not bear then, and I answered that you were too far beyond my hopes.”",short sailor imagination go great length guess more know sail tax subject bear answer hope

61,"The evening went off like any other evening--people ate and talked, thought Mrs. Rivers looking very ill, and Miss Rivers very pretty--Flora forced herself into being very friendly to Sir Henry, commiserating the disappointment to which she had led him; and she hoped that he suspected the state of affairs, though Tom, no longer supplanted by his elder brother, pursued Meta into the sheltered nook, where Flora had favoured her seclusion, to apologise for having left her to the guidance of poor Norman, whose head was with the blackamoors. It was all Harry’s fault.",evening go other evening person eat talk think look ill force friendly commiserate disappointment lead hope suspect state affair supplant elder brother pursue shelter nook favour seclusion apologise leave guidance poor head blackamor fault

65,"Harry checked himself, for Meta was colouring so painfully that his own sunburned face caught the glow.

67,"“Then I know it now,” said Harry, sheltering his face by leaning over the back of a chair, and taming the hearty gaiety of his voice. “Well done, Meta; there’s nothing like old June in all the world! You may take my word for it, and I knew you would have the sense to find it out.”",know say shelter face lean back chair tame hearty gaiety voice do be old world take word know have sense find 
68,"They were well out of sight, and Meta only answered by a good tight squeeze of his kind hand between both her own. Tom, suddenly recovering from his displeasure at being thrust aside, whisked round, dropped on a footstool before Meta, looked up in her face, and said, “Hallo!” in such utter amazement that there was nothing for it but to laugh more uncontrollably than was convenient. “Come along, Tom,” said Harry, pulling him up by force, “she does not want any of your nonsense. We will not plague her now.”",sight answer good tight squeeze kind hand own recover displeasure thrust whisk drop footstool look face say such utter amazement be laugh convenient come say pull force want nonsense plague

72,"Dr. Spencer discussed his architecture with the archdeacon; but his black eyes roamed heedfully after the young gentleman and lady, in the opposite corners of the room; and, as he drove home afterwards with the youths, he hummed scraps of Scottish songs, and indulged in silent smiles.",discuss architecture archdeacon black eye roam young gentleman lady opposite corner room drive youth humm scrap scottish song indulge silent smile 
73,"Those at home had been far more demonstrative. Dr. May had arrived, declaring himself the proudest doctor in her Majesty’s dominions, and Ethel needed nothing but his face to explain why, and tell her that dear old June’s troubles were over, and their pretty little Meta was their own--a joy little looked for to attend their foundation-stone.",home demonstrative arrive declare proud doctor dominion need face explain tell dear old trouble little meta own joy little look attend foundation stone 
74,"The dreaded conference with Lord Cosham had proved highly gratifying. There might be something in the fact that he could not help it, which assisted in his ready acquiescence, but he was also a sensible right-minded man, who thought that the largeness of Meta’s fortune was no reason that it should be doubled; considered that, in the matter of connection, the May family had the advantage, and saw in Norman; a young man whom any one might have pleasure in bringing forward. Oxford had established confidence both in his character and talents, and his speech had been such as to impress an experienced man, like Lord Cosham, with an opinion of his powers, that prepared a welcome for him, such as no one could have dared to expect. His lordship thought his niece not only likely to be happier, but to occupy a more distinguished position with such a man as Norman May, than with most persons of ready-made rank and fortune.",dread conference prove gratifying be fact help assist ready acquiescence sensible right minded man think largeness fortune reason double consider matter connection family have advantage see young man one have pleasure bring establish confidence character talent speech such impress experienced man opinion power prepare welcome such dare expect lordship think niece likely happy occupy distinguished position man most person ready make rank fortune 
75,"The blushing and delighted Dr. May had thought himself bound to speak of his son’s designs, but he allowed that the project had been formed under great distress of mind, and when he saw it treated by so good a man, as a mere form of disappointed love, he felt himself reprieved from the hardest sacrifice that he had ever been called on to make, loved little Meta the better for restoring his son, and once more gave a free course to the aspirations that Norman’s brilliant boyhood had inspired. Richard took the same view, and the evening passed away in an argument--as if any one had been disputing with them--the father reasoning loud, the son enforcing it low, that it had become Norman’s duty to stay at home to take care of Meta, whose father would have been horrified at his taking her to the Antipodes. They saw mighty tasks for her fortune to effect in England, they enhanced each other’s anticipations of Norman’s career, overthrew abuses before him, heaped distinctions upon him, and had made him Prime Minister and settled his policy, before ten o’clock brought their schemes to a close.",blushing delighted think bind speak son design allow project form great distress mind see treat good man mere form disappoint love feel reprieve hard sacrifice call make love little good restore son give free course aspiration brilliant boyhood inspire take same view evening pass argument one dispute father reason son enforce low become duty stay home take care father horrify take see mighty task fortune effect enhance other anticipation career overthrow abuse heap distinction make prime settle policy o'clock bring scheme close 
76,"Mary gazed and believed; Margaret lay still and gently assented; Ethel was silent at first, and only when the fabric became extremely airy and magnificent, put in her word with a vehement dash at the present abuses, which grieved her spirit above all, and, whether vulnerable or not, Norman was to dispose of, like so many giants before Mr. Great-heart.",gaze believe lay assent silent first fabric become airy magnificent put word vehement dash present abuse grieve spirit vulnerable dispose many giant great heart 
77,"She went upstairs, unable to analyse her sentiments. To be spared the separation would be infinite relief--all this prosperity made her exult--the fair girl at the Grange was the delight of her heart, and yet there was a sense of falling off; she disliked herself for being either glad or sorry, and could have quarrelled with the lovers for perplexing her feelings so uncomfortably.",go unable analyse sentiment spare separation infinite relief prosperity make exult fair girl delight heart be sense fall dislike glad sorry quarrell lover perplex feeling

82,"The happy youth, in the flush of love and joy, bent gently, almost tearfully, down in silence to the white form, half seen in the twilight, whose hopes had fleeted away from earth, and who was calmly, softly gliding after them. Hardly a word was uttered, but of all the many heartfelt thoughts that had passed while the face was pressed into Margaret’s pillow, and her sympathising arms round the neck, surely none was ever deeper, than was his prayer and vow that his affection should be like hers, unearthly, and therefore enduring.",happy youth flush love joy bend silence white form half see twilight hope fleet earth glide word utter many heartfelt thought pass face press pillow sympathise arm neck deep prayer vow affection unearthly endure 
83,"The embrace was all; Margaret must not be agitated, and, indeed, the events of the day had been too much for her, and the ensuing morning brought the fluttering of heart and prostration of strength, no longer a novelty and occasion of immediate terror, but the token of the waning power of life.",embrace agitate event day much ensuing morning bring flutter heart prostration strength novelty occasion immediate terror token wane power life 
84,"Till she was better, her father had no thoughts for aught else, but, as with many another invalid, the relief from present distress was as cheering as if it had been recovery, and ere night, her placid look of repose had returned, and she was devising pretty greetings for her newest Daisy.",good father have thought aught else many invalid relief present distress cheer recovery night placid look repose return devise pretty greeting new 
85,"Perhaps the sobering effect of these hours of anxiety was in Norman’s favour, on entering into conversation with his father. Those visions, which had had their swing the night before, belonged to the earlier, more untamed period of Dr. May’s life, and had melted away in the dim room, made sacred by lingering mementos of his wife, and in the sound of that panting breath and throbbing heart. His vehemence had been, after all, chiefly against his own misgivings, and when he heard of his son’s resolution, and Meta’s more than acquiescence, he was greatly touched, and recurred to his kind, sorrowful promise, that he would never be a stumbling-block in the path of his children. Still he owned himself greatly allured by the career proposed by Lord Cosham, and thought Norman should consider the opportunities of doing good in, perhaps, a still more important and extensive field than that which he had chosen.",sobering effect hour anxiety favour enter conversation father vision have swing night belong early untamed period life melt dim room make sacred linger memento wife sound panting breath throbb heart vehemence own misgiving hear son resolution more acquiescence touch recurr kind sorrowful promise stumbling block path child own allure career propose think consider opportunity do good important extensive field choose 
86,"“Time was that I should have grasped at such a prospect,” said Norman; “but I am not the man for it. I have too much ambition, and too little humility. You know, father, how often you have had to come to my rescue, when I was running after success as my prime object.”",time grasp prospect say man have much ambition little humility know father have come rescue run success prime object

108,"Norman fared better with the uncle than he had expected. Lord Cosham, as a philanthropist, could not, with any consistency, set his face against missions, even when the cost came so near home; and he knew that opposition made the like intentions assume a heroic aspect that maintained them in greater force. He therefore went over the subject in a calm dispassionate manner, which exacted full and grateful consideration from the young man.",fare good uncle expect philanthropist consistency set face mission cost come home know opposition make like intention assume heroic aspect maintain great force go subject calm dispassionate manner exact full grateful consideration young man 
109,"The final compromise was, that nothing should be settled for a year, during which Norman would complete his course of study, and the matter might be more fully weighed. Mrs. Arnott would probably return, and bring experience and judgment, which would, or ought to, decide the question--though Meta had a secret fear that it might render it more complicated than ever. However, the engagement and the mission views had both been treated so much more favourably than could have been hoped, that they felt themselves bound to be patient and forbearing. As Meta said, “If they showed themselves wilful children, they certainly did not deserve to be trusted anywhere.”",final compromise settle year complete course study matter weigh return bring experience judgment decide question have secret fear render complicated engagement mission view treat hope feel bind patient forbear say show wilful child deserve trust 
110,"Lord Cosham made his niece listen to a kind exhortation not to press her influence towards a decision that might be repented, when too late to be repaired, without a degrading sense of failure--putting her in mind of the privations that would lose romance by their pettiness, and which money could not remedy; and very sensibly representing that the effect of these on temper and health was to be duly considered as a serious impediment to usefulness.",make niece listen kind exhortation press influence decision repent late repair degrading sense failure put mind privation lose romance pettiness money remedy represent effect temper health consider serious impediment usefulness

113,"“I know it is so,” said Meta firmly, “but risks must be run, and he is willing to take the chance. I do not think it can be presumption, for, you know, I am strong; and Dr. May would say if he could not warrant me. I fancy household work would be more satisfactory and less tiring than doing a season thoroughly, and I mean to go through a course of Finchley manuals in preparation.”",know say risk run willing take chance think presumption know strong say warrant fancy household work satisfactory tiring do season mean go course manual preparation

115,"“I think not. It is because it is not couleur de rose that I am so much bent upon it. I have had plenty of that all my life. I expect much that will be very disagreeable and not at all heroic; but if I can only make Norman think it fun, that will be one purpose answered. I do believe he will do his work better for having me, and, at least, I shall pay his passage.”",think rose bent have plenty life expect much disagreeable heroic make think fun purpose answer believe do work good have least pay passage 
116,"Her uncle shook his head, but did not try to say any more. George had begun by loud exclamations against the project, in which he was vehemently abetted by Tom, who primed him with all sorts of outrageous abuse of the niggers and cannibals, who would make Norman’s coats out of all shape, and devour little Meta at a mouthful--predictions which Meta accepted most merrily, talking of herself so resignedly, as bound upon a spit, and calling out to be roasted slower and faster, that she safely conducted off their opposition by way of a standing joke. As to Norman’s coats, she threatened to make them herself, and silenced Tom for ever by supposing, in malicious simplicity, that he must be able to teach her the most unexceptional cut.",uncle shake head try say more begin loud exclamation project abet prime sort outrageous abuse nigger cannibal make coat shape devour little meta mouthful prediction accept most talk bind spit call roast slow fast conduct opposition way standing joke coat threaten make silence suppose malicious simplicity able teach unexceptional cut

118,"She was gently and touchingly considerate towards the lovers, silently but unobtrusively obviating all that could jar on their feelings, and employing her exquisite tact in the kindest manner.",considerate lover obviat jar feeling employ exquisite tact kindest manner 
119,"She released Meta from the expedition to Ryde, silencing scruples on the one hand, by a suggestion of “poor Sir Henry,” and, on the other, by offering to exchange her for Mary. The first proposal made Mary take such a spring in her chair, with eyes so round, and cheeks so red, and such a shriek about Harry and the Bucephalus, that no one could have borne to say one word in opposition, even if it had not been the opinion of the Council that sea air would best repair Mary’s strength.",release expedition silence scruple hand suggestion poor other offer exchange first proposal make take spring chair eye cheek red shriek borne say word opposition opinion sea air repair strength 
120,"Ethel had some private fears of a scene, since it was one of Miss Bracy’s idiosyncrasies to be hurt whenever Mary was taken out of her hands; and she went to announce the design, in dread lest this shock should destroy the harmony that had prevailed for many months; nay, she almost believed, since the loss of the Alcestis had been known.",have private fear scene idiosyncrasy hurt take hand go announce design dread shock destroy harmony prevail many month believe loss know 
121,"She was agreeably surprised. Miss Bracy thought Mary in need of the change, and discussed both her and Blanche in so pleasant and sensible a manner, that Ethel was quite relieved. She partook in Mary’s anticipations of pleasure, forwarded her preparations, and was delighted with her promise of letters--promises that Mary bestowed so largely, in the fullness of her heart, that there were fears lest her whole time should be spent in writing.",surprised think need change discuss pleasant sensible manner relieved partaok anticipation pleasure forward preparation delight promise letter promise bestow fullness heart be fear whole time spend writing 
122,"Her soft heart indulged in a shower of tears when she wished them all good-bye; and Ethel and Blanche found the house was very empty without her; but that was only till Meta came in from a walk with Norman, and, under the plea of trying to supply Mary’s place, did the work of five Maries, and a great deal besides.",soft heart indulge shower tear wish good bye find house empty come walk plea try supply place do work great deal 
123,"Nothing could be happier than Meta’s visit, brightening the house so that the Mays thought they had never known half her charms, helping whatever was going on, yet ready to play with Daisy, tell stories to Aubrey, hear Tom’s confidences, talk to Margaret, read with Norman, and teach Richard singing for his school children. The only vexation was, that every one could not always engross her entirely; and Dr. May used to threaten that they should never spare her to that long-legged fellow, Norman.",happy visit brighten house think know charm help go ready play tell story hear confidence talk read teach sing school child only vexation one engross use threaten spare long legged fellow 
124,"She had persuaded Bellairs to go and take care of Flora and Mary, instead of the French maid--a plan which greatly satisfied Margaret, who had never liked the looks of Coralie, and which Meta held to be a grand emancipation. She persuaded old nurse to teach her to be useful, and Margaret used to declare that she witnessed scenes as good as a play in her room, where the little dexterous scholar, apparently in jest, but really in sober, earnest, wiled instruction from the old woman; and made her experiments, between smiles and blushes, and merrily glorying in results that promised that she would be a notable housewife. Whether it were novelty or not, she certainly had an aptitude and delight in domestic details, such as Ethel never could attain; and, as Dr. May said, the one performed by a little finger what the other laboured at with a great mind.",persuade go take care french maid plan satisfy like look hold grand emancipation persuade old nurse teach useful use declare witness scene good play room little dexterous scholar jest sober earnest wiled instruction old woman make experiment smile blush glory result promise notable housewife novelty have aptitude delight domestic detail such attain say one perform little finger other laboure great mind 
125,"In the schoolroom, Meta was as highly appreciated. She found an hour for helping Blanche in her music, and for giving, what was still more useful, an interest and spirit to studies, where, it must be owned, poor good Mary had been a dead weight. She enlivened Miss Bracy so much, and so often contrived a walk or a talk with her, that the saucy Blanche told Hector that she thought Ethel would be quite second-fiddle with Miss Bracy.",schoolroom appreciate find hour help music give useful interest spirit study own poor good dead weight enliven contrive walk talk saucy tell think second fiddle 
126,"No such thing. Miss Bracy’s great delight was in having a listener for her enthusiasm about Miss Ethel. She had been lately having a correspondence with a former school-fellow, who was governess in a family less considerate than the Mays, and who poured out, in her letters, feelings much like those with which Miss Bracy had begun.",such thing great delight have listener enthusiasm have correspondence former school fellow governess family considerate pour letter feeling begin 
127,"Nothing could be more salutary than to find herself repeating all Ethel’s pieces of advice; and, one day, when her friend had been more distressed than usual, she called Ethel herself, to consult on her answer, owning how much she was reminded of herself.",salutary find repeat piece advice day friend distressed usual call consult answer own much remind

131,"“I think,” said Ethel, breaking in, “the philosophy is this: I believe that it is a trying life. I know teaching takes a great deal out of one; and loneliness may cause tendencies to dwell on fancied slights in trifles, that might otherwise be hurried over. But I think the thing is, to pass them over, and make a conscience of turning one’s mind to something fresh--”",think say break philosophy believe try life know teaching take great deal loneliness cause tendency dwell fancy slight trifle hurry think thing pass make conscience turn mind fresh

There’s a truism!”",more take work infant school think way happy useful get many interest fresh vigorous think personality be truism 
134,"“Very true, though,” said Miss Bracy. “Indeed, all your kindness and consideration would never have done me half the good they have, dear Miss Ethel, if you had not taught me that referring all to one’s own feelings and self is the way to be unhappy.”",true say kindness consideration do good have dear teach refer own feeling self way unhappy

139,"“None could help being better for living with papa,” said Ethel.",help good live papa say 
140,"Ethel made Miss Bracy happy by a kiss before she left her. It was a cheering belief that, whatever the future trials of her life might be, the gentle little lady would meet them with a healthier mind, more vigorous in overlooking troubles and without punctilious sensitiveness on the lookout for affronts. “Believing all things, bearing all things, hoping all things, enduring all things,” would be to her the true secret of serenity of spirits.",make happy kiss leave cheer belief future trial life gentle little lady meet healthy mind vigorous overlook trouble punctilious sensitiveness lookout affront believe thing bear thing hope thing endure thing true secret serenity spirit 
141,"Ethel might not have been blameless or consistent in her dealings in this difficult intercourse, but her kind heart, upright intention, and force of character, had influence far beyond her own perception. Indeed, she knew not that she had personal influence at all, but went on in her own straightforward humility.",blameless consistent dealing difficult intercourse kind heart upright intention force character have influence own perception know have personal influence go own straightforward humility
