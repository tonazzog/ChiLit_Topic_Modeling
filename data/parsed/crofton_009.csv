2,"The boys were all in the school-room in the grey of the morning;--no one late.  Mr Tooke was already there.  Almost every boy looked wistfully in the grave face of the master;--almost every one but his own son.  He looked down; and it seemed natural: for his eyes were swollen with crying.  He had been crying as much as Proctor: but, then, so had Dale.",boy school room grey morning late boy look grave face master one own son look seem natural eye swollen cry cry much have 
3,"""Your school-fellow is doing well,"" said Mr Tooke, in a low voice, which, however, was heard to the farthest end of the room.  ""His brother will tell you that he saw him quietly asleep; and I have just seen him so.  He deserves to do well; for he is a brave little boy.  He is the youngest of you; but I doubt whether there is a more manly heart among you all.""",school fellow do say low voice hear farthest end room brother tell see asleep see deserve do brave little boy young doubt be manly heart

5,"""As to how this accident happened,"" continued the master, ""I have only to say this.  The coping-stone of the wall was loose,--had become loosened by the frost.  Of that I am aware.  But it would not,--it could not have fallen, if your school-fellow had not been pulled from the top of the wall.  Several hands pulled him,--as many as could get a hold. Whose these hands were, it would be easy to ascertain; and it would not be difficult to discover whose was the hand which first laid hold, and gave the rest their grasp.  But--"" How earnestly here did every one look for the next words!--""But your school-fellow considers the affair an accident,--says he himself was cross.""",accident happen continue master have say coping stone wall loose become loosen frost aware fall school fellow pull top wall several hand pull many get hold hand easy ascertain difficult discover hand lay hold give rest grasp one look next word school fellow consider affair accident say cross

9,"""I do not think that a promise of impunity can be any great comfort to those concerned,"" continued Mr Tooke: ""but such comfort as they can find in it, they may.  Both from my wish to indulge one who has just sustained so great a misfortune, and because I think he is right, I shall never inquire,--never wish to know more than I do of the origin of this accident.

11,"""The only thing you can now do for your school-fellow,"" concluded the master, ""is to be quiet throughout the day.  As soon as he can be removed, he will be carried to Mr Shaw's.  Till then, you will take care that he loses no rest through you,--Now, first class, come up.""",only thing do school fellow conclude master quiet day remove carry take care lose rest first class come 
12,"While this class was up, Phil's neighbour began whispering; and the next boy leaned over to hear; and one or two came softly up behind: but, though they were busily engaged in question and answer, the master's stern voice was not heard (as usual when there was talking) to say ""Silence there!""

30,"As Mrs Proctor was placing the pillows comfortably, for Hugh to have his breakfast, after he was washed, and the bed made nicely smooth, he yawned, and said he was sleepy still, and that he wondered what o'clock it was.  His mother told him it was a quarter past ten.",place pillow have breakfast wash bed make smooth yawn say sleepy wonder o'clock mother tell quarter past

33,"""No, no: I remember that,"" said Hugh.  ""But it was the oddest, longest night!--and yesterday too!  To think that it is not a whole day yet since it all happened!  Oh!

34,"""Yes: we know you are fond of coffee; and so am I.  So we will have some together.""",know fond coffee have 
35,"""How comfortable!"" exclaimed Hugh; for he was really hungry; which was no wonder, after the pain and exhaustion he had gone through.  His state was like that of a person recovering from an illness--extremely ready to eat and drink, but obliged to be moderate.",comfortable exclaim hungry wonder pain exhaustion go state person recover illness ready eat drink oblige moderate 
36,"When warmed and cheered by his coffee, Hugh gave a broad hint that he should like to see Phil, and one or two more boys--particularly Dale. His mother told him that the surgeon, Mr Annanby, would be coming soon. If he gave leave, Phil should come in, and perhaps Dale.  So Hugh was prepared with a strong entreaty to Mr Annanby on the subject; but no entreaty was needed.  Mr Annanby thought he was doing very well; and that he would not be the worse for a little amusement and a little fatigue this morning, if it did not go on too long.  So Phil was sent for, when the surgeon was gone.  As he entered, his mother went out to speak to Mr Tooke, and write home.",warm cheer coffee give broad hint like see more boy mother tell surgeon come give leave come prepare strong entreaty subject entreaty need think do bad little amusement little fatigue morning go send surgeon gone enter mother go speak write 
37,"She then heard from Mr Tooke and from Firth and Dale, how strong was the feeling in Hugh's favour--how strong the sympathy for his misfortune throughout the school.  Hugh had seen no tears from her; but she shed them now.  She then earnestly entreated that Hugh might not hear what she had just been told.  He felt no doubt of the kindness of his schoolfellows, and was therefore quite happy on that score.  He was very young, and to a certain degree vain; and if this event went to strengthen his vanity, to fill his head with selfish thoughts, it would be a misfortune indeed.  The loss of his foot would be the least part of it.  It lay with those about him to make this event a deep injury to him, instead of the blessing which all trials are meant by Providence eventually to be.  They all promised that, while treating Hugh with the tenderness he deserved, they would not spoil the temper in which he had acted so well, by making it vain and selfish.  There was no fear, meantime, of Phil's doing him any harm in that way; for Phil had a great idea of the privileges and dignity of seniority; and his plan was to keep down little boys, and make them humble; not being aware that to keep people down is not the way to make them humble, but the contrary. Older people than Phil, however, often fall into this mistake.  Many parents do, and many teachers; and very many elder brothers and sisters.",hear strong feeling favour strong sympathy misfortune school see tear shed entreat hear tell feel doubt kindness schoolfellow happy score young certain degree vain event go strengthen vanity fill head selfish thought misfortune loss foot least part lay make event deep injury blessing trial mean promise treat tenderness deserve spoil temper act make vain selfish be fear meantime do harm way have great idea privilege dignity seniority plan keep little boy make humble aware keep person way make humble contrary old person fall mistake many parent many teacher many elder brother sister

We played till we were quite tired; and then we sat down; and still she did not come. At last, we were sure that she had forgotten all about us; and we did not think she would remember us any more: and we both cried.  Oh!  How we did cry!  Then a woman came along, with a basket at her back, and a great net over her arm: and she asked us what was the matter; and when we told her, she said she thought it was not likely that mother would forget us.  And then she bade us take hold of her gown, one on each side, and she would try to take us to mother; and the next thing was mother came in sight.  When the woman told her what we had said, they both laughed; and mother told us it was impossible that she should leave us behind.  I asked Agnes afterwards why it was impossible; and she did not know; and I am sure she was as glad as I was to see mother come in sight.

She had come in before closing her letter to Mr Proctor, to ask whether Hugh wished to send any particular message home.  As she listened, she was too sorry to feel amused.  She perceived that she could not have done her whole duty to her children, if there could be such a question as this in their hearts--such a question discussed between them, unknown to her.

101,"She asked both the boys why they thought it was that, before little birds are fledged, the parent birds bring them food, as often as once in a minute, all day long for some weeks.  Perhaps no creatures can go through harder work than this; and why do they do it?  For unfledged birds, which are capable of nothing whatever but clamouring for food, are as useless little creatures as can be imagined.  Why does the cat take care of her little blind kitten with so much watchfulness, hiding it from all enemies till it can take care of itself.  It is because love does not depend on the value of the creature loved--it is because love grows up in our hearts at God's pleasure, and not by our own choice; and it is God's pleasure that the weakest and the least useful and profitable should be the most beloved, till they become able to love and help in their turn.",ask boy think little bird fledge parent bird bring food minute day week creature go hard work do unfledged bird capable clamoure food useless little creature imagine cat take care little blind kitten much watchfulness hide enemy take care love depend value creature love love grow heart pleasure own choice pleasure weak least useful profitable beloved become able love help turn

This is surely a reason for God filling the hearts of parents with love, and making them willing to work and suffer for their children, even while the little ones are most unwise and unprofitable.
