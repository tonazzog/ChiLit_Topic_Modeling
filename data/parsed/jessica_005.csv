1,CHAPTER V. A NEW WORLD OPENS.,new opens 
2," The minister was siting in an easy chair before a comfortable fire with a hymn-book in his hand, which he closed as the three children appeared in the open doorway. Jessica had seen his pale and thoughtful face many a time from her hiding-place, but she had never met the keen, earnest, searching gaze of his eyes, which seemed to pierce through all her wretchedness and misery, and to read at once the whole history of her desolate life. But before her eyelids could droop, or she could drop a reverential courtesy, the minister’s face kindled with such a glow of pitying tenderness and compassion as fastened her eyes upon him, and gave her new heart and courage. His children ran to him, leaving Jessica upon the mat at the door, and with eager voices and gestures told him the difficulty they were in.",minister sit easy chair comfortable fire hymn book hand close child appear open doorway see pale thoughtful face many time hiding place meet keen earnest search gaze eye seem pierce wretchedness misery read whole history desolate life eyelid driop drop reverential courtesy minister face kindle glow pity tenderness compassion fasten eye give new heart courage child run leave mat door eager voice gesture tell difficulty

7,"“Mother used to play ‘Jessica’ at the theatre, sir,” she said, “and I used to be a fairy in the pantomime, till I grew too tall and ugly. If I’m pretty when I grow up mother says I shall play too; but I’ve a long time to wait.

13,"“The servant of God and of man,” he answered solemnly. “Jessica, I am your servant.”",servant man answer servant 
14,"The child shook her head, and laughed shrilly as she gazed round the room and at the handsome clothing of the minister’s daughters, while she drew her rags closer about her and shivered a little, as if she felt a sting of the east wind which was blowing keenly through the streets. The sound of her shrill childish laugh made the minister’s heart ache.",child shake head laugh gaze room handsome clothing minister daughter draw rag close shiver little feel sting east wind blow street sound shrill childish laugh make minister heart ache

16,"But before there was time to answer the door into the chapel was opened and Daniel stood upon the threshold. At first he stared blandly forward, but then his grave face grew ghastly pale, and he laid his hand upon the door to support himself until he could recover his speech and senses. Jessica also looked about her, scared and irresolute, as if anxious to run away or to hide herself. The minister was the first to speak.",be time answer door chapel open stand threshold first stare grave face grow pale lay hand door support recover speech sense look scared irresolute anxious run hide minister first speak 
17,"“Jessica,” he said, “there is a place close under my pulpit where you shall sit, and where I can see you all the time. Be a good girl, and listen, and you will hear something about God. Standring, put this little one in front of the pews by the pulpit steps.”",say be place close pulpit sit see time good girl listen hear stand put little one front pew pulpit step 
18,"Before she could believe it, for very gladness, Jessica found herself inside the chapel, facing the glittering organ, from which a sweet strain of music was sounding. Not far from her Jane and Winny were peeping over the front of their pew with friendly smiles and glances. It was evident that the minister’s elder daughter was anxious about her behavior, and she made energetic signs to her when to stand and when to kneel; but Winny was content with smiling at her whenever her head rose above the top of the pew. Jessica was happy, but not in the least abashed. The ladies and gentlemen were not at all unlike those whom she had often seen when she was a fairy at the theatre; and very soon her attention was engrossed by the minister, whose eyes often fell upon her, as she gazed eagerly, with uplifted face, upon him. She could scarcely understand a word of what he said, but she liked the tones of his voice and the tender pity of his face as he looked down upon her. Daniel hovered about a good deal, with an air of uneasiness and displeasure, but she was unconscious of his presence. Jessica was intent upon finding out what a minister and God were.",believe gladness find chapel face glitter organ sweet strain music sound peep front pew friendly smile glance evident minister elder daughter anxious behavior make energetic sign stand kneel content smile head rise top pew happy least abash lady gentleman see fairy theatre attention engross minister eye fall gaze uplift face understand word say like tone voice tender pity face look hover good deal air uneasiness displeasure unconscious presence intent find minister
