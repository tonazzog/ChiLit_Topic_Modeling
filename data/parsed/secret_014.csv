He's always talking about live things.  He never talks about dead things or things that are ill. He's always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying--or looking down at the earth to see something growing.  He has such round blue eyes and they are so wide open with looking about.

To talk about Dickon meant to talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people who lived in it on sixteen shillings a week--and the children who got fat on the moor grass like the wild ponies.  And about Dickon's mother--and the skipping-rope--and the moor with the sun on it--and about pale green points sticking up out of the black sod.  And it was all so alive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before--and Colin both talked and listened as he had never done either before.  And they both began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together.  And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old creatures--instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who believed that he was going to die.",good thing say talk mean talk moor cottage person live shilling week child get fat moor grass wild pony mother skip rope moor sun pale green point stick black sod alive talk talk talk listen do begin laugh nothing child happy laugh end make much noise ordinary healthy natural year old creature hard little unloving girl sickly boy believe go die
