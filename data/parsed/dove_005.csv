1,CHAPTER IV. SNOW-WREATHS WHEN ’TIS THAW,snow wreaths thaw 
2," ERMENTRUDE had by no means recovered the ground she had lost, before the winter set in; and blinding snow came drifting down day and night, rendering the whole view, above and below, one expanse of white, only broken by the peaks of rock which were too steep to sustain the snow. The waterfall lengthened its icicles daily, and the whole court was heaped with snow, up even to the top of the high steps to the hall; and thus, Christina was told, would it continue all the winter.  What had previously seemed to her a strangely door-like window above the porch now became the only mode of egress, when the barons went out bear or wolf-hunting, or the younger took his crossbow and hound to provide the wild-fowl, which, under Christina’s skilful hands, would tempt the feeble appetite of Ermentrude when she was utterly unable to touch the salted meats and sausages of the household.",have means recover ground lose winter set blind snow come drift day night rendering whole view expanse white break peak rock steep sustain snow waterfall lengthen icicle whole court heap snow top high step hall tell continue winter seem door like window porch become only mode egress baron go bear wolf hunting young take crossbow hound provide wild fowl skilful hand temp feeble appetite unable touch salt meat sausages household 
3,"In spite of all endeavours to guard the windows and keep up the fire, the cold withered the poor child like a fading leaf, and she needed more and more of tenderness and amusement to distract her attention from her ailments.  Christina’s resources were unfailing.  Out of the softer pine and birch woods provided for the fire, she carved a set of draughtsmen, and made a board by ruling squares on the end of a settle, and painting the alternate ones with a compound of oil and charcoal.  Even the old Baron was delighted with this contrivance, and the pleasure it gave his daughter.  He remembered playing at draughts in that portion of his youth which had been a shade more polished, and he felt as if the game were making Ermentrude more hike a lady.  Christina was encouraged to proceed with a set of chessmen, and the shaping of their characteristic heads under her dexterous fingers was watched by Ermentrude like something magical.  Indeed, the young lady entertained the belief that there was no limit to her attendant’s knowledge or capacity.",spite endeavour guard window keep fire cold wither poor child fade leaf need more more tenderness amusement distract attention ailment resource unfailing softer pine birch wood provide fire carve set draughtsmen make board rule square end settle paint alternate one compound oil charcoal old delight contrivance pleasure give daughter remember play draught portion youth shade polished feel game make hike lady encourage proceed set chessmen shaping characteristic head dexterous finger watch magical young lady entertain belief be limit attendant knowledge capacity 
4,"Truly there was a greater brightness and clearness beginning to dawn even upon poor little Ermentrude’s own dull mind.  She took more interest in everything: songs were not solely lullabies, but she cared to talk them over; tales to which she would once have been incapable of paying attention were eagerly sought after; and, above all, the spiritual vacancy that her mind had hitherto presented was beginning to be filled up.  Christina had brought her own books—a library of extraordinary extent for a maiden of the fifteenth century, but which she owed to her uncle’s connexion with the arts of wood-cutting and printing.  A Vulgate from Dr. Faustus’s own press, a mass book and breviary, Thomas à Kempis’s _Imitation_ and the _Nuremburg Chronicle_ all in Latin, and the poetry of the gentle Minnesinger and bird lover, Walther von Vogelweide, in the vernacular: these were her stock, which Hausfrau Johanna had viewed as a foolish encumbrance, and Hugh Sorel would never have transported to the castle unless they had been so well concealed in Christina’s kirtles that he had taken them for parts of her wardrobe.",be great brightness clearness begin dawn poor little own dull mind take more interest song lullaby care talk tale incapable pay attention seek spiritual vacancy mind present begin fill bring own book library extraordinary extent maiden fifteenth century owe uncle connexion art wood cutting printing own press mass book breviary poetry gentle bird lover vernacular stock view foolish encumbrance transport castle conceal kirtle take part wardrobe 
5,"Most precious were they now, when, out of the reach of all teaching save her own, she had to infuse into the sinking girl’s mind the great mysteries of life and death, that so she might not leave the world without more hope or faith than her heathen forefathers.  For that Ermentrude would live Christina had never hoped, since that fleeting improvement had been cut short by the fever of the wine-cup; the look, voice, and tone had become so completely the same as those of Regina Grundt’s little sister who had pined and died.  She knew she could not cure, but she could, she felt she could, comfort, cheer, and soften, and she no longer repined at her enforced sojourn at Adlerstein.  She heartily loved her charge, and could not bear to think how desolate Ermentrude would be without her.  And now the poor girl had become responsive to her care.  She was infinitely softened in manner, and treated her parents with forms of respect new to them; she had learnt even to thank old Ursel, dropped her imperious tone, and struggled with her petulance; and, towards her brother, the domineering, uncouth adherence was becoming real, tender affection; while the dependent, reverent love she bestowed upon Christina was touching and endearing in the extreme.",precious reach teaching save own have infuse sink girl mind great mystery life death leave world more hope faith heathen forefather live hope fleeting improvement cut short fever wine cup look voice tone become same little sister pine die know cure feel comfort cheer soften repine enforce sojourn love charge bear think desolate poor girl become responsive care soften manner treat parent form respect new learn thank old drop imperious tone struggle petulance brother domineering uncouth adherence become real tender affection dependent reverent love bestow touch endear extreme 
6,"Freiherr von Adlerstein saw the change, and congratulated himself on the effect of having a town-bred bower woman; nay, spoke of the advantage it would be to his daughter, if he could persuade himself to make the submission to the Kaiser which the late improvements decided on at the Diet were rendering more and more inevitable.  _Now_ how happy would be the winner of his gentle Ermentrude!",see change congratulate effect have town breed bower woman speak advantage daughter persuade make submission late improvement decide diet rendering more inevitable happy winner gentle 
7,"Freiherrinn von Adlerstein thought the alteration the mere change from child to woman, and felt insulted by the supposition that any one might not have been proud to match with a daughter of Adlerstein, be she what she might.  As to submission to the Kaiser, that was mere folly and weakness—kaisers, kings, dukes, and counts had broken their teeth against the rock of Adlerstein before now!  What had come over her husband and her son to make them cravens?",think alteration mere change child woman feel insult supposition one proud match daughter submission mere folly weakness kaiser king duke count break tooth rock come husband son make craven 
8,"For Freiherr Eberhard was more strongly convinced than was his father of the untenableness of their present position.  Hugh Sorel’s reports of what he heard at Ulm had shown that the league that had been discussed at Regensburg was far more formidable than anything that had ever previously threatened Schloss Adlerstein, and that if the Graf von Schlangenwald joined in the coalition, there would be private malice to direct its efforts against the Adlerstein family.  Feud-letters or challenges had been made unlawful for ten years, and was not Adlerstein at feud with the world?",convinced father untenableness present position report hear show league discuss formidable threaten join coalition be private malice direct effort family feud letter challenge make unlawful year feud world 
9,"Nor did Eberhard look on the submission with the sullen rage and grief that his father felt in bringing himself to such a declension from the pride of his ancestors.  What the young Baron heard up stairs was awakening in him a sense of the poorness and narrowness of his present life.  Ermentrude never spared him what interested her; and, partly from her lips, partly through her appeals to her attendant, he had learnt that life had better things to offer than independence on these bare rocks, and that homage might open the way to higher and worthier exploits than preying upon overturned waggons.",look submission sullen rage grief father feel bring declension pride ancestor young hear stair awaken sense poorness narrowness present life spare interest lip appeal attendant learn life have good thing offer independence bare rock homage open way high worthier exploit prey overturn waggon 
10,"Dietrich of Berne and his two ancestors, whose lengthy legend Christina could sing in a low, soft recitative, were revelations to him of what she meant by a true knight—the lion in war, the lamb in peace; the quaint oft-repeated portraits, and still quainter cities, of the Chronicle, with her explanations and translations, opened his mind to aspirations for intercourse with his fellows, for an honourable name, and for esteem in its degree such as was paid to Sir Parzival, to Karl the Great, or to Rodolf of Hapsburgh, once a mountain lord like himself.  Nay, as Ermentrude said, stroking his cheek, and smoothing the flaxen beard, that somehow had become much less rough and tangled than it used to be, “Some day wilt thou be another Good Freiherr Eberhard, whom all the country-side loved, and who gave bread at the castle-gate to all that hungered.”",ancestor lengthy legend sing low soft recitative revelation mean true knight lion war lamb peace quaint repeat portrait quainter city explanation translation open mind aspiration intercourse fellow honourable name esteem degree such pay great mountain lord say stroke cheek smooth flaxen beard become rough tangled use day good country side love give bread castle gate hunger 
11,"Her brother believed nothing of her slow declension in strength, ascribing all the change he saw to the bitter cold, and seeing but little even of that alteration, though he spent many hours in her room, holding her in his arms, amusing her, or talking to her and to Christina.  All Christina’s fear of him was gone.  As long as there was no liquor in the house, and he was his true self, she felt him to be a kind friend, bound to her by strong sympathy in the love and care for his sister.  She could talk almost as freely before him as when alone with her young lady; and as Ermentrude’s religious feelings grew stronger, and were freely expressed to him, surely his attention was not merely kindness and patience with the sufferer.",brother believe slow declension strength ascribe change see bitter cold see little alteration spend many hour room hold arm amusing talk fear gone be liquor house true self feel kind friend bound strong sympathy love care sister talk alone young lady religious feeling grow strong express attention kindness patience sufferer 
12,"The girl’s soul ripened rapidly under the new influences during her bodily decay; and, as the days lengthened, and the stern hold of winter relaxed upon the mountains, Christina looked with strange admiration upon the expression that had dawned upon the features once so vacant and dull, and listened with the more depth of reverence to the sweet words of faith, hope and love, because she felt that a higher, deeper teaching than she could give must have come to mould the spirit for the new world to which it was hastening.",girl soul ripen new influence bodily decay day lengthen stern hold winter relax mountain look strange admiration expression dawn feature vacant dull listen more depth reverence sweet word faith hope love feel high deep teaching give come mould spirit new world hasten

14,"out of the valley, whose rich green shone smiling round the pool into which the Debateable Ford spread.  The waterfall had burst its icy bonds, and dashed down with redoubled voice, roaring rather than babbling.  Blue and pink hepaticas—or, as Christina called them, liver-krauts—had pushed up their starry heads, and had even been gathered by Sir Eberhard, and laid on his sister’s pillow.  The dark peaks of rock came out all glistening with moisture, and the snow only retained possession of the deep hollows and crevices, into which however its retreat was far more graceful than when, in the city, it was trodden by horse and man, and soiled with smoke.",valley rich green shine smile pool spread waterfall burst icy bond dash redoubl voice roar babble blue pink hepatica call liver kraut push starry head gather lay sister pillow dark peak rock come glisten moisture snow retain possession deep hollow crevice retreat graceful city trodd horse man soil smoke 
15,"Christina dreaded indeed that the roads should be open, but she could not love the snow; it spoke to her of dreariness, savagery, and captivity, and she watched the dwindling stripes with satisfaction, and hailed the fall of the petty avalanches from one Eagle’s Step to another as her forefathers might have rejoiced in the defeat of the Frost giants.",dread road open love snow speak dreariness savagery captivity watch dwindle stripe satisfaction hail fall petty avalanche step forefather rejoice defeat giant 
16,"But Ermentrude had a love for the white sheet that lay covering a gorge running up from the ravine.  She watched its diminution day by day with a fancy that she was melting away with it; and indeed it was on the very day that a succession of drifting showers had left the sheet alone, and separated it from the masses of white above, that it first fully dawned upon the rest of the family that, for the little daughter of the house, spring was only bringing languor and sinking instead of recovery.",have love white sheet lay cover gorge run ravine watch diminution day day fancy melt very day succession drift shower leave sheet separate mass white dawn rest family little daughter house spring bring languor sink recovery 
17,"Then it was that Sir Eberhard first really listened to her entreaty that she might not die without a priest, and comforted her by passing his word to her that, if—he would not say when—the time drew near, he would bring her one of the priests who had only come from St. Ruprecht’s cloister on great days, by a sort of sufferance, to say mass at the Blessed Friedmund’s hermitage chapel.",listen entreaty die priest comfort pass word say time draw bring priest come cloister great day sort sufferance say mass blessed hermitage chapel 
18,"The time was slow in coming.  Easter had passed with Ermentrude far too ill for Christina to make the effort she had intended of going to the church, even if she could get no escort but old Ursel—the sheet of snow had dwindled to a mere wreath—the ford looked blue in the sunshine—the cascade tinkled merrily down its rock—mountain primroses peeped out, when, as Father Norbert came forth from saying his ill-attended Pentecostal mass, and was parting with the infirm peasant hermit, a tall figure strode up the pass, and, as the villagers fell back to make way, stood before the startled priest, and said, in a voice choked with grief, “Come with me.”",time slow come pass ill make effort intend go church get escort old sheet snow dwindle mere wreath look blue sunshine cascade tinkle rock mountain primrose peep come say ill attend pentecostal mass part infirm peasant hermit tall figure strode pass villager fall make way stand startle priest say voice choke grief come

21,"“I mean him no ill,” replied Eberhard, clearing his voice with difficulty; “I would but have him do his office.  Art thou afraid, priest?”",mean ill reply clear voice difficulty have do office art afraid priest 
22,"“Who needs my office?” demanded Father Norbert.  “Show me fit cause, and what should I dread?  Wherefore dost thou seek me?”",need office demand show fit cause dread seek 
23,"“For my sister,” replied Eberhard, his voice thickening again.  “My little sister lies at the point of death, and I have sworn to her that a priest she shall have.  Wilt thou come, or shall I drag thee down the pass?”",sister reply voice thicken little sister lie point death swear priest have come drag pass 
24,"“I come, I come with all my heart, sir knight,” was the ready response. “A few moments and I am at your bidding.”",come come heart sir knight ready response few moment bid 
25,"He stepped back into the hermit’s cave, whence a stair led up to the chapel.  The anchorite followed him, whispering—“Good father, escape! There will be full time ere he misses you.  The north door leads to the Gemsbock’s Pass; it is open now.”",step hermit cave stair lead chapel anchorite follow whisper good father escape be full time misse north door lead pass open 
26,“Why should I baulk him?  Why should I deny my office to the dying?” said Norbert.,baulk deny office die say 
27,"“Alas! holy father, thou art new to this country, and know’st not these men of blood!  It is a snare to make the convent ransom thee, if not worse.  The Freiherrinn is a fiend for malice, and the Freiherr is excommunicate.”",holy father art new country know ’st man blood snare make convent ransom bad fiend malice excommunicate 
28,"“I know it, my son,” said Norbert; “but wherefore should their child perish unassoilzied?”",know son say child perish unassoilzied 
29,"“Art coming, priest?” shouted Eberhard, from his stand at the mouth of the cave.",art come priest shout stand mouth cave 
30,"And, as Norbert at once appeared with the pyx and other appliances that he had gone to fetch, the Freiherr held out his hand with an offer to “carry his gear for him;” and, when the monk refused, with an inward shudder at entrusting a sacred charge to such unhallowed hands, replied, “You will have work enow for both hands ere the castle is reached.”",appear pyx other appliance go fetch hold hand offer carry gear monk refuse inward shudder entrust sacred charge such unhallowed hand reply have work hand castle reach 
31,"But Father Norbert was by birth a sturdy Switzer, and thought little of these Swabian Alps; and he climbed after his guide through the most rugged passages of Eberhard’s shortest and most perpendicular cut without a moment’s hesitation, and with agility worthy of a chamois.  The young baron turned for a moment, when the level of the castle had been gained, perhaps to see whether he were following, but at the same time came to a sudden, speechless pause.",birth sturdy think little swabian climb guide rugged passage short perpendicular cut moment hesitation agility worthy chamois young baron turn moment level castle gain see follow same time come sudden speechless pause 
32,"On the white masses of vapour that floated on the opposite side of the mountain was traced a gigantic shadowy outline of a hermit, with head bent eagerly forward, and arm outstretched.",white mass vapour float opposite side mountain trace gigantic shadowy outline hermit head bend forward arm outstretch 
33,"The monk crossed himself.  Eberhard stood still for a moment, and then said, hoarsely,—“The Blessed Friedmund!  He is come for her;” then strode on towards the postern gate, followed by Brother Norbert, a good deal reassured both as to the genuineness of the young Baron’s message and the probable condition of the object of his journey, since the patron saint of her race was evidently on the watch to speed her departing spirit.",monk cross stand moment say bless come strode postern gate follow good deal reassure genuineness young message probable condition object journey patron saint race watch speed depart spirit 
34,"Sir Eberhard led the way up the turret stairs to the open door, and the monk entered the death-chamber.  The elder Baron sat near the fire in the large wooden chair, half turned towards his daughter, as one who must needs be present, but with his face buried in his hands, unable to endure the spectacle.  Nearer was the tall form of his wife, standing near the foot of the bed, her stern, harsh features somewhat softened by the feelings of the moment.  Ursel waited at hand, with tears running down her furrowed cheeks.",lead way turret stair open door monk enter death chamber elder sit fire large wooden chair half turn daughter need present face bury hand unable endure spectacle tall form wife stand foot bed stern harsh feature soften feeling moment wait hand tear run furrow cheek 
35,"For such as these Father Norbert was prepared; but he little expected to meet so pure and sweet a gaze of reverential welcome as beamed on him from the soft, dark eyes of the little white-checked maiden who sat on the bed, holding the sufferer in her arms.  Still less had he anticipated the serene blessedness that sat on the wasted features of the dying girl, and all the anguish of labouring breath.",such prepare expect meet pure sweet gaze reverential welcome beam soft dark eye little white check maiden sit bed hold sufferer arm anticipate serene blessedness sit waste feature die girl anguish labour breath 
36,"She smiled a smile of joy, held up her hand, and thanked her brother. Her father scarcely lifted his head, her mother made a rigid curtsey, and with a grim look of sorrow coming over her features, laid her hand over the old Baron’s shoulder.  “Come away, Herr Vater,” she said; “he is going to hear her confession, and make her too holy for the like of us to touch.”",smile smile joy hold hand thank brother father lift head mother make rigid curtsey grim look sorrow come feature lay hand old shoulder come say go hear confession make holy like touch 
37,"The old man rose up, and stepped towards his child.  Ermentrude held out her arms to him, and murmured—",old man rise step child hold arm murmure 
38,"“Father, father, pardon me; I would have been a better daughter if I had only known—”  He gathered her in his arms; he was quite past speaking; and they only heard his heavy breathing, and one more whisper from Ermentrude—“And oh! father, one day wilt thou seek to be absolved?” Whether he answered or not they knew not; he only gave her repeated kisses, and laid her down on her pillows, then rushed to the door, and the passionate sobs of the strong man’s uncontrolled nature might be heard upon the stair.  The parting with the others was not necessarily so complete, as they were not, like him, under censure of the Church; but Kunigunde leant down to kiss her; and, in return to her repetition of her entreaty for pardon, replied, “Thou hast it, child, if it will ease thy mind; but it is all along of these new fancies that ever an Adlerstein thought of pardon.  There, there, I blame thee not, poor maid; it thou wert to die, it may be even best as it is.  Now must I to thy father; he is troubled enough about this gear.”",father father pardon good daughter know gather arm past speak hear heavy breathing more whisper father day seek absolve answer know give repeat kisse lay pillow rush door passionate sob strong man uncontrolled nature hear stair parting other complete censure lean kiss return repetition entreaty pardon reply hast child ease mind new fancy think pardon blame poor maid die good father trouble gear 
39,"But when Eberhard moved towards his sister, she turned to the priest, and said, imploringly, “Not far, not far!  Oh! let them,” pointing to Eberhard and Christina, “let them not be quite out of sight!”",move sister turn priest say let point let sight 
40,"“Out of hearing is all that is needed, daughter,” replied the priest; and Ermentrude looked content as Christina moved towards the empty north turret, where, with the door open, she was in full view, and Eberhard followed her thither.  It was indeed fully out of earshot of the child’s faint, gasping confession.  Gravely and sadly both stood there. Christina looked up the hillside for the snow-wreath.  The May sunshine had dissolved it; the green pass lay sparkling without a vestige of its white coating.  Her eyes full of tears, she pointed the spot out to Eberhard.  He understood; but, leaning towards her, told, under his breath, of the phantom he had seen.  Her eyes expanded with awe of the supernatural.  “It was the Blessed Friedmund,” said Eberhard.  “Never hath he so greeted one of our race since the pious Freiherrinn Hildegarde.  Maiden, hast thou brought us back a blessing?”",hearing need daughter reply priest look content move empty north turret door open full view follow earshot child faint gasp confession stand look hillside snow wreath sunshine dissolve green pass lay sparkling vestige white coating eye full tear point spot understand lean tell breath phantom see eye expand awe supernatural bless say have greet race pious hast bring blessing 
41,"“Ah! well may she be blessed—well may the saints stoop to greet her,” murmured Christina, with strangled voice, scarcely able to control her sobs.",bless saint stake greet murmure strangle voice able control sob 
42,"Father Norbert came towards them.  The simple confession had been heard, and he sought the aid of Christina in performing the last rites of the Church.",come simple confession hear seek aid perform last rite 
43,"“Maiden,” he said to her, “thou hast done a great and blessed work, such as many a priest might envy thee.”",say do great bless work such many priest envy 
44,"Eberhard was not excluded during the final services by which the soul was to be dismissed from its earthly dwelling-place.  True, he comprehended little of their import, and nothing of the words, but he gazed meekly, with uncovered head, and a bewildered look of sadness, while Christina made her responses and took her part with full intelligence and deep fervour, sorrowing indeed for the companion who had become so dear to her, but deeply thankful for the spiritual consolation that had come at last.  Ermentrude lay calm, and, as it were, already rapt into a higher world, lighting up at the German portions of the service, and not wholly devoid of comprehension of the spirit even of the Latin, as indeed she had come to the border of the region where human tongues and languages are no more.",exclude final service soul dismiss earthly dwelling place true comprehend little import word gaze uncover head bewilder look sadness make response take part full intelligence deep fervour sorrow companion become dear thankful spiritual consolation come last lay calm rapt high world light german portion service devoid comprehension spirit come border region human tongue language more 
45,"She was all but gone when the rite of extreme unction was completed, and they could only stand round her, Eberhard, Christina, Ursel, and the old Baroness, who had returned again, watching the last flutterings of the breath, the window thrown wide open that nothing might impede the passage of the soul to the blue vault above.",gone rite extreme unction complete stand old return watch last fluttering breath window throw open impede passage soul blue vault 
46,"The priest spoke the beautiful commendation, “Depart, O Christian soul.” There was a faint gesture in the midst for Christina to lift her in her arms—a sign to bend down and kiss her brow—but her last look was for her brother, her last murmur, “Come after me; be the Good Baron Ebbo.”",priest speak beautiful commendation depart christian soul be faint gesture midst lift arm sign bend kiss brow last look brother last murmur come good
