3," It was queer, but so it was. The children said very little to each other the next day of their new adventures. Only Hugh felt satisfied that this time little Jeanne had forgotten nothing; daylight Jeanne and moonlight Jeanne were the same. Yet he had a feeling that if he said much about it, if he persisted in trying to convince Jeanne that he had been right all through, he might spoil it all. It would be like seizing the fairy lady's cobweb threads roughly, and spoiling them, and finding you had nothing left. He felt now quite content to let it all be like a pretty dream which they both knew about, but which was not for everyday life.",queer child say little other next day new adventure feel satisfied time little forget daylight same have feeling say much persist try convince right spoil seize fairy lady cobweb thread spoil find have leave feel content let pretty dream know everyday life 
4,"Only one impression remained on his mind. He got the greatest wish to learn to throw balls like the princess of the Brown Bull story, and for some days every time they went out, he kept peering in at the toy-shop windows to see if such a thing as golden balls was to be had. And at last Jeanne asked him what he was always looking for, and then he told her.",impression remain mind get great wish learn throw ball princess brown story day time go keep peer toy shop window see thing golden ball have last ask look tell

11,"However, she joined Hugh in the search, and many a day when they were out they peeped together not only into the toy-shops, but into the windows of the queer old curiosity shops, of which, in the ancient town which was Jeanne's home, there were many. And at last one day they told Marcelline what it was they were so anxious to find. She shook her head. There was no such toy in _this_ country, she said, but she did not laugh at them, or seem to think them silly. And she advised them to be content with the prettiest balls they _could_ get, which were of nice smooth buff-coloured leather, very well made, and neither too soft nor too hard. And in the sunlight, said Jeanne, they really had rather a shiny, goldy look.",join search many day peep toy shop window queer old curiosity shop ancient town home be many last day tell anxious find shake head be such toy country say laugh seem think silly advise content prettiest ball get nice smooth buff coloured leather make soft hard sunlight say have shiny goldy look 
12,"For several days to come these balls were a great interest to the children. Early and late they were practising at them, and, with patience and perseverance, they before long arrived at a good deal of skill. Jeanne was the quicker in the first place, but Hugh was so patient that he soon equalled her, and then the interest grew still greater.",several day come ball great interest child late practise patience perseverance arrive good deal skill quick first place patient equall interest grow great

15,"They were playing in the tapestry room, for Marcelline had told them they would have more space there, as it was large, and Hugh's little bed in the corner did not take up much room. It was getting dusk, for the days were not yet very long, though winter was almost over, and they had been playing a good while. As Hugh spoke he gave the last ball a final throw high up in the air, higher than usual, for though Jeanne sprang forward to catch it, she missed it somehow. It dropped to the ground behind her.",play tapestry room tell have more space large little bed corner take much room get dusk day long winter play good while speak give last ball final throw air high usual spring catch miss drop ground

19,"""It must have got behind the tapestry,"" said Hugh, pulling back as he spoke, a corner of the hangings close to where he and Jeanne were, which seemed loose. And at the same moment both children gave a little cry of astonishment. Instead of the bare wall which they expected to see, or to feel rather, behind the tapestry, a flight of steps met their view--a rather narrow flight of steps running straight upwards, without twisting or turning, and lighted from above by a curious hanging lamp, hanging by long chains from a roof high up, which they could not see.",get tapestry say pull speak corner hanging close seem loose same moment child give little cry astonishment bare wall expect see feel tapestry flight step meet view narrow flight step run twist turn light curious hanging lamp hang long chain roof see

21,"""No, of course not,"" said Jeanne. ""It must be a part of our house, I suppose, but I never saw it before. Shall we go up, Chéri, and see where it takes us to?

23,"And just at that moment a funny thing happened. They heard a little noise, and looking up, there--hopping down the stair before them, step by step, as if some one had started it from the top, came the lost ball, or what the children thought the lost ball, for with an exclamation Hugh darted forward to pick it up, and held it out to Jeanne. But Jeanne looked at it with astonishment.",moment funny thing happen hear little noise look hopping stair step step one start top come lose ball child think lose ball exclamation dart pick hold look astonishment

27,"The children seized hold of each other's hands, and hurried up the stair. The steps were easier to mount than those of the corkscrew staircase up to the white lady's turret, and very soon the children found themselves at the top of the first flight. There, looking upwards, they could see the roof. It was a sort of cupola; the chains from which the lamps hung were fastened to the centre, but the rest of the roof was of glass, and through it the children saw the sky, already quite dark, and with innumerable stars dotting its surface.",child seize hold other hand hurry stair step easy mount corkscrew staircase white lady turret child find top first flight look see roof sort cupola chain lamp hang fasten centre rest roof glass child see sky dark innumerable star dot surface

34,"""Now, Dudu,"" said Jeanne, ""you needn't talk that way. Whether we're fond of wonders or not, anyhow it's you that's given us them to be fond of.

It seemed more like the roof of a little tower or turret.",turn door enter open hopp child follow find say roof house part house say seem roof little tower turret

Well, one day--it was a very hot day, I remember, and I had come up here for a little change of air--I was standing on the edge of the parapet watching our two young ladies who were walking up and down the terrace path down there, and thinking how nice they looked in their white dresses and blue sashes tied close up under their arms, like the picture of your great-grandmother as a young girl, in the great salon, Mademoiselle Jeanne.""",say raven exact year day hot day remember come little change air stand edge parapet watch young lady walk terrace path think nice look white dress blue sashe tie arm picture great grandmother young girl great salon

54,"""And I don't suppose your great-grandmother would think yours at all pretty, either, Mademoiselle Jeanne,"" said Dudu, with the queer sort of croak which he used for a laugh. ""It is one of the things that has amazed me very much in my observations--the strange fancies the human race has about clothes. Of course you are not so fortunate as we are in having them ready-made, but still I cannot understand why you don't do the best you can--adopt a pattern and keep to it always.

""It would be very stupid every morning when you got up, and every time you were going out, or friends coming to see you, or anything like that--it would be _very_ stupid never to have to think, 'What shall I put on?' or to plan what colours would look nice together. There would hardly be any use in having shops or dressmakers, or anything.

56,"""It is all a matter of taste, Mademoiselle,"" replied Dudu, so amiably that Hugh wondered more and more at his politeness to Jeanne, who was certainly not very civil to him. ""For my part, I confess I have always had a great fancy for white--the force of contrast, I suppose--and this brings me back to telling you how very nice your great-grandmother and her sister looked that day walking up and down the terrace path in their white dresses.""",matter taste reply wonder more politeness civil part confess have great fancy white force contrast suppose bring tell nice great grandmother sister look day walk terrace path white dress 
57,"""My great-grandmother!"" exclaimed Jeanne. ""Why, you said 'our young ladies.'""",great grandmother exclaim say young lady 
58,"""So they were our young ladies,"" replied Dudu. ""Even though one was your great-grandmother, Mademoiselle, and not yours only but Monsieur Chéri's too, and the other, of course, your great-grand-aunt. There have been many 'our young ladies' that I can remember in this house, which has so long been the home of one family, and my home always. In three or four hundred years one sees a good deal. Ah yes! Well, as I was saying, I was standing on the edge of the parapet looking over at the young ladies, and admiring them and the sunshine and the flowers in the garden all at once, when I suddenly heard a window open. It was not one of the windows of our house. I have very quick ears, and I knew that in an instant, so I looked about to see what window it was. In those days there were not quite so many houses behind our garden as there are now. Your great-great-grandfather sold some of the land about that time, and then houses were built, but just then there were only two or three that overlooked one side of the garden. One of them was a large high house, which was let in flats to various families, often visitors to the town, or strangers who had come for a short time for the education of their children, or some other reason. It was not long before I discovered that the window I had heard open was in this house. It was one on the second story, looking on to a little balcony which at one end was not very high above the terrace walk. I watched to see who had opened the window, and in a few moments I saw peeping out half timidly the pretty fair face of a little girl. Quite a little girl she was, not much older than you, Mademoiselle Jeanne, but not like you, for she had light hair and soft blue eyes, and a fair face like Monsieur Chéri. She was a little English girl. She peeped out, and then, seeing that no one was observing her, she came quietly on to the balcony, and, creeping down into a corner where she could scarcely be seen, she sat watching our two pretty young ladies with all her eyes. No wonder, I thought; they were very pretty young ladies, and it was nice to see them together, walking up and down with arms intertwined, and talking eagerly, their talk sometimes interrupted by merry bursts of soft girlish laughter. And all the time the lonely little creature on the balcony sat and watched them longingly, her little pale face pressed against the bars, her plain black dress almost hiding her from notice.",young lady reply great grandmother other course great grand aunt be many young lady remember house home family home year see good deal say stand edge parapet look young lady admire sunshine flower garden hear window open window house have quick ear know instant look see window day be many house garden be great great grandfather sell land time house build be overlook side garden large high house let flat various family visitor town stranger come short time education child other reason discover window hear open house second story look little balcony end high terrace walk watch see open window few moment see peep half fair face little girl little girl old have light hair soft blue eye fair face little english girl peep see observe come balcony creep corner see sit watch pretty young lady eye wonder think young lady nice see walk arm intertwine talk talk interrupt merry burst soft girlish laughter time lonely little creature balcony sit watch little pale face press bar plain black dress hide notice

O mother! why did you go away and leave me?'""",happy look young lady lonely little girl say happy have sister have talk kiss play say sad aunt angry mother go leave

61,"""Of course I have; I told you so, Mademoiselle,"" said Dudu drily. ""I had better ears than your great-grandmother and her sister, for they heard nothing, not even when the poor little girl took courage to push her face farther forward between the railings, and to say very softly and timidly,",course have tell say have good ear great grandmother sister hear poor little girl take courage push face railing say 
62,"""'Mesdemoiselles, Mesdemoiselles, _might_ I come and walk with you? I am so tired of being here all alone.'",come walk tired 
63,"""They did not hear her. They were talking too busily about the fête of their mother, I think, which was to be in a few days, and of what they were to prepare for her. And the poor little girl sat up there for more than an hour watching them with longing eyes, but not daring to call out more loudly. It made me quite melancholy to see her, and when at last our young ladies went in, and she had to give up hopes of gaining their attention, it made me more melancholy still, she looked so disappointed, and her eyes were full of tears; and I felt quite upset about her, and kept turning over in my head what I could do to make her happier. I thought about it for some time, and at last I decided that the first thing to do was to find out more about the little stranger and the cause of her grief. For this purpose I stationed myself the next morning just below the window of the kitchen of her house, which, by hopping from the balcony, I was easily able to do, and by listening to the conversation of the servants I soon learned all I wanted to know. She was, as I had supposed, a little English girl. Her mother had died in Italy but a short time before, and she was now in the charge of her mother's aunt, an elderly and severe lady, who understood nothing about children, and took no pains to make poor little Charlotte happy. So it was a sad life for the child, whose father also was dead; and as from the talk of the servants I gathered that she was a good and gentle little girl, I felt more sorry for her than before; and as I hopped back on to the balcony I looked to see if she was again at the window. Yes, there she was, her face pressed against the glass, staring out in the direction of the terrace walk, watching, no doubt, to see if our young ladies were coming out again. I hopped in front of the window backwards and forwards two or three times to catch her attention, and a smile lit up her little pale face when she saw me.",hear talk fête mother think few day prepare poor little girl sit more hour watch long eye dare call make melancholy see last young lady go have give hope gain attention make melancholy look disappointed eye full tear feel upset keep turn head do make happy think time last decide first thing do find more little stranger cause grief purpose station next morning window kitchen house hopping balcony able do listen conversation servant learn want know suppose little english girl mother die short time charge mother aunt elderly severe lady understand child take pain make poor little happy sad life child father dead talk servant gather good gentle little girl feel sorry hopp balcony look see window face press glass stare direction terrace walk watch doubt see young lady come hopp front window forward time catch attention smile light little pale face see

That afternoon our young ladies came again on to the terrace, but they did not stay long, and the little girl was not to be seen on the balcony, though I daresay she was peering out through the window to see as far as she could. And the next day and the day after were very rainy, so there was nothing I could do. But after that again there came a very fine day--a beautiful sunny day it was, I remember it well--and our young ladies came out like the flowers and the birds to enjoy it. Out, too, came the forlorn little black figure, hiding itself as before behind the railings of the balcony, but looking with longing eyes at the garden below, which to her must have seemed a kind of Paradise.
