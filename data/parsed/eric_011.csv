3,"Upton, expatriated from his study, was allowed to use one of the smaller class-rooms which were occupied during play-hours by those boys who were too high in the school for ""the boarders' room,"" and who were waiting to succeed to the studies as they fell vacant. There were three or four others with him in this class-room, and although it was less pleasant than his old quarters, it was yet far more comfortable than the Pandemonium of the shell and fourth-form boys.",expatriate study allow use small class room occupy play hour boy high school border room wait succeed study fall vacant be other class room pleasant old quarter comfortable shell fourth form boy 
4,"As a general rule, no boys were allowed to sit in any of the class-rooms except their legitimate occupants. The rule, however, was very generally overlooked, and hence Eric, always glad of an opportunity to escape from the company of Barker and his associates, became a constant frequenter of his friend's new abode. Here they used to make themselves very comfortable. Joining the rest, they would drink coffee or chocolate, and amuse themselves over the fire with Punch, or some warlike novel in a green or yellow cover. One of them very often read aloud to the rest: and Eric, being both a good reader and a merry, intelligent listener, soon became quite a favorite among the other boys.",general rule boy allow sit class room legitimate occupant rule overlook glad opportunity escape company associate become constant frequenter friend new abode use make comfortable roin rest drink coffee chocolate amuse fire punch warlike novel green yellow cover read rest good reader merry intelligent listener become favorite other boy 
5,"Mr. Rose had often seen him sitting there, and left him unmolested; but if ever Mr. Gordon happened to come in and notice him, he invariably turned him out, and after the first offence or two, had several times set him an imposition. This treatment gave fresh intensity to his now deeply-seated disgust at his late master, and his expressions of indignation at ""Gordon's spite"" were loud and frequent.",see sit leave unmolested happen come notice turn first offence have several time set imposition treatment give fresh intensity seat disgust late master expression indignation spite loud frequent 
6,"One day Mr. Gordon had accidentally come in, and found no one there but Upton and Eric; they were standing very harmlessly by the window, with Upton's arm resting kindly on Eric's shoulder as they watched with admiration the net-work of rippled sunbeams that flashed over the sea. Upton had just been telling Eric the splendid phrase [Greek: anêrithmon gelasma pontiôn], which he had stumbled upon in an Aeschylus lesson that morning, and they were trying which would hit on the best rendering of it. Eric stuck up for the literal sublimity of ""the innumerable laughter of the sea,"" while Upton was trying to win him over to ""the many-twinkling smile of ocean."" They were enjoying the discussion, and each stoutly maintaining his own rendering, when Mr. Gordon entered.",day come find stand window arm rest shoulder watch admiration net work ripple sunbeam flash sea tell splendid phrase stumble lesson morning try hit good rendering stick literal sublimity innumerable laughter sea try win many twinkle smile ocean enjoy discussion maintain own rendering enter 
7,"On this occasion he was particularly angry; he had an especial dislike of seeing the two boys together, because he fancied that the younger had grown more than usually conceited and neglectful, since he had been under the fifth-form patronage; and he saw in Eric's presence there, a new case of wilful disobedience.",occasion angry have especial dislike see boy fancy young grow more conceited neglectful fifth form patronage see presence new case wilful disobedience 
8,"""Williams, here _again!_"" he exclaimed sharply. ""Why, sir, you seem to suppose that you may defy rules with impunity!

16,"""Then I shall request Mr. Rose to do so in future; your conceit and impertinence are getting intolerable.""",request do future conceit impertinence get intolerable 
17,"Eric only answered with a fiery glance; the next minute Upton joined him on the stairs, and Mr. Gordon heard them laughing a little ostentatiously, as they ran out into the playground together. He went away full of strong contempt, and from that moment began to look on the friends as two of the worst boys in the school.",answer fiery glance next minute join stair hear laugh little run playground go full strong contempt moment begin look friend bad boy school 
18,"This incident had happened on Thursday, which was a half-holiday, and instead of being able to join in any of the games, Eric had to spend that weary afternoon in writing away at the fourth Georgic; Upton staying in a part of the time to help him a little, by dictating the lines to him--an occupation not unfrequently interrupted by storms of furious denunciation against Mr. Gordon's injustice and tyranny; Eric vowing ""that he would pay him out somehow yet.""",incident happen half holiday able join game have spend weary afternoon write fourth stay part time help little dictate line occupation interrupt storm furious denunciation injustice tyranny vow pay 
19,"The imposition was not finished that evening, and it again consumed some of the next day's leisure, part of it being written between schools in the forbidden class-room. Still it was not quite finished on Friday afternoon at six, when school ended, and Eric stayed a few minutes behind the rest to scribble off the last ten lines; which done, he banged down the lid of his desk, not locking it, and ran out.",imposition finish evening consume next day leisure part write school forbidden class -room finish afternoon school end stay few minute rest scribble last line do bang lid desk lock run

21,"Mr. Rose and several other masters had not a room to themselves, like Mr. Gordon, but heard their forms in the great hall. At one end of this hall was a board used for the various school notices, to which there were always affixed two or three pieces of paper containing announcements about examinations and other matters of general interest.",several other master have room hear form great hall end hall board use various school notice affix piece paper contain announcement examination other matter general interest 
22,"On Saturday morning (when Eric was to give up his Georgic), the boys, as they dropped into the hall for morning school, observed a new notice on the board, and, thronging round to see what it was, read these words, written on a half-sheet of paper, attached by wafers to the board--",morning give boy drop hall morning school observe new notice board throng see read word write half sheet paper attach wafer board

24,"As may be supposed, so completely novel an announcement took them all very much by surprise, and they wondered who had been so audacious as to play this trick. But their wonder was cut short by the entrance of the masters, and they all took their seats, without any one tearing down the dangerous paper.",suppose novel announcement take surprise wonder audacious play trick wonder cut short entrance master take seat one tear dangerous paper

27,"Just at this juncture Eric came in, having been delayed by Mr. Gordon while he rigidly inspected the imposition. As he took his seat, Montagu, who was next him, whispered--",juncture come delay inspect imposition take seat whisper

32,"""Well, there'll be no end of a row; you'll see.""",be end row see 
33,"During this conversation, Dr. Rowlands came in with Mr. Rose. He read the paper, frowned, pondered a moment, and then said to Mr. Rose--""Would you kindly summon the lower school into the hall? As it would be painful to Mr. Gordon to be present, you had better explain to him how matters stand.""",conversation come read paper frown ponder moment say summon low school hall painful present explain matter stand

36,"""I have summoned you all together,"" said the Doctor, ""on a most serious occasion. This morning, on coming into the school-room, the masters found that the notice-board had been abused for the purpose of writing up an insult to one of our number, which is at once coarse and wicked. As only a few of you have seen it, it becomes my deeply painful duty to inform you of its purport; the words are these--'Gordon is a surly devil.'""--A _very_ slight titter followed this statement, which was instantly succeeded by a sort of thrilling excitement; but Eric, when he heard the words, started perceptibly, and colored as he caught Montagu's eye fixed on him.",summon say serious occasion morning come school room master find notice board abuse purpose write insult number coarse wicked few see become painful duty inform purport word surly slight titter follow statement succeed sort thrilling excitement hear word start color catch eye fix 
37,"Dr. Rowlands continued--""I suppose this dastardly impertinence has been perpetrated by some boy out of a spirit of revenge. I am perfectly amazed at the unparalleled audacity and meanness of the attempt, and it may be very difficult to discover the author of it. But, depend upon it, discover him _we will_, at whatever cost. Whoever the offender may be, and he must be listening to me at this moment, let him be assured that he shall _not_ be unpunished.

39,"""Very well,"" said the head master, ""the guilty boy is not inclined to confess.

51,"Dr. Rowlands' look searched him through and through, and seemed to burn into his heart. He did not meet it, but hung his head. The Doctor felt certain from his manner that he was guilty. He chained him to the spot with his glance for a minute or two, and then said slowly, and with a deep sigh--",look search seem burn heart meet hang head feel certain manner guilty chain spot glance minute say deep sigh

64,"The various items of evidence were put together, and certainly they seemed to prove a strong case against Eric. In addition to the probabilities already mentioned, it was found that the ink used was of a violet color, and a peculiar kind, which Eric was known to patronise; and not only so, but the wafers with which the paper had been attached to the board were yellow, and exactly of the same size with some which Eric was said to possess. How the latter facts had been discovered, nobody exactly knew, but they began to be very generally whispered throughout the school.",various item evidence put seem prove strong case addition probability mention find ink use violet color peculiar kind know patronise wafer paper attach board yellow same size say possess latter fact discover know begin whisper school

67,"The consequence was, they all began to shun him. Eric was put into Coventry.

70,"He was alone in his misery. Some one, he perceived, had plotted to destroy his character, and he saw too clearly how many causes of suspicion told against him.

71,"Never in his life had he been so wretched. He wandered alone to the rocks, and watched the waves dashing against them with the rising tide. The tumult of the weather seemed to relieve and console the tumult of his heart. He drank in strength and defiance from the roar of the waters, and climbed to their very edge along the rocks, where every fresh, rush of the waves enveloped him in white swirls of angry loam. The look of the green, rough, hungry sea, harmonised with his feelings, and he sat down and stared into it, to find relief from the torment of his thoughts.",life wretched wander rock watch wave dash rise tide tumult weather seem relieve console tumult heart drink strength defiance roar water climb very edge rock fresh rush wave envelop white swirl angry loam look green rough hungry sea harmonise feeling sit stare find relief torment thought 
72,"At last, with a deep sigh, he turned away to go back, and meet the crowd of suspicious and unkindly companions, and brood alone over his sorrow in the midst of them. He had not gone many steps, when he caught sight of Russell in the distance. His first impulse was to run away and escape; but Russell determined to stop him, and when he came up, said, ""Dear Eric, I have sought you out on purpose to tell you that _I_ don't suspect you, and have never done so for a moment.
