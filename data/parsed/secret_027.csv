1,CHAPTER XXVII. IN THE GARDEN,garden 
2," In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have been discovered.  In the last century more amazing things were found out than in any century before.  In this new century hundreds of things still more astounding will be brought to light.  At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope it can be done, then they see it can be done--then it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago.  One of the new things people began to find out in the last century was that thoughts--just mere thoughts--are as powerful as electric batteries--as good for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison.  To let a sad thought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germ get into your body.  If you let it stay there after it has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.",century beginning world wonderful thing discover last century amazing thing find century new century hundred thing astounding bring light first person refuse believe strange new thing do begin hope do see do do world wonder do century new thing person begin find last century thought mere thought powerful electric battery good sunlight bad poison let sad thought bad one get mind dangerous let scarlet fever germ get body let stay get get live 
3,"So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about her dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to be pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly, bored and wretched child.  Circumstances, however, were very kind to her, though she was not at all aware of it.  They began to push her about for her own good.  When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed old gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime and with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boy and his ""creatures,"" there was no room left for the disagreeable thoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow and tired.",mind full disagreeable thought dislike sour opinion person determination pleased interested yellow face sickly bored wretch child circumstance kind aware begin push own good mind fill robin moorland cottage crowd child queer crabb old gardener common little housemaid springtime secret garden come alive day day moor boy creature be room leave disagreeable thought affect liver digestion make yellow tired 
4,"So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his fears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and reflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical half-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and the spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand upon his feet if he tried to do it.  When new beautiful thoughts began to push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood.  His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there was nothing weird about it at all.  Much more surprising things can happen to any one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one.  Two things cannot be in one place.",shut room think fear weakness detestation person look reflect hump early death hysterical half crazy little hypochondriac know sunshine spring know get stand foot try do new beautiful thought begin push old hideous one life begin come blood run vein strength pour flood scientific experiment practical simple be weird surprising thing happen one disagreeable discourage thought come mind have sense remember time push put agreeable courageous one thing place

6,"While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming alive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away beautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains of Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind filled with dark and heart-broken thinking.  He had not been courageous; he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark ones.  He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on mountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him and flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them.  A terrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had let his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to allow any rift of light to pierce through.  He had forgotten and deserted his home and his duties.  When he traveled about, darkness so brooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people because it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom.  Most strangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime on his soul.  He, was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was, ""Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.""",secret garden come alive child come alive be man wonder certain beautiful place norwegian fiord valley mountain man year keep mind fill dark heart break thinking courageous try put other thought place dark one wander blue lake think lain mountain side sheet deep blue gentian bloom flower breath fill air think terrible sorrow fall happy let soul fill blackness refuse allow rift light pierce forget desert home duty travel darkness brood sight wrong do other person poison air gloom most stranger think mad man hide crime soul tall man draw face crooked shoulder name enter hotel register 
7,"He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his study and told her she might have her ""bit of earth."" He had been in the most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere more than a few days.  He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He had been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and had looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them with such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.",travel wide day see study tell have bit earth beautiful place remain more few day choose quietest remotest spot top mountain head cloud look other mountain sun rise touch such light make seem world bear 
8,"But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he realized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had happened.  He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had been walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man's soul out of shadow.  He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.  But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a carpet of moss by a stream.  It was a clear little stream which ran quite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.  Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbled over and round stones.  He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.  The valley was very, very still.",light seem touch day realize first time year strange thing happen wonderful valley austrian walk such beauty lift man soul shadow walk long way lift last feel tired throw rest carpet moss stream clear little stream run narrow way luscious damp greenness make sound low laughter bubble round stone see bird come dip head drink flick wing fly seem thing alive tiny voice make stillness seem deep valley 
9,"As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven gradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valley itself.  He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growing at its edge.  There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he found himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.  He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were.  He did not know that just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind--filling and filling it until other things were softly pushed aside.  It was as if a sweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risen until at last it swept the dark water away.  But of course he did not think of this himself.  He only knew that the valley seemed to grow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate blueness.  He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening to him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath and wondering at himself.  Something seemed to have been unbound and released in him, very quietly.",sit gaze clear running water feel mind body grow quiet quiet valley wonder go sleep sit gaze sunlit water eye begin see thing grow edge be lovely mass blue forget not grow close stream leave wet find look remember look such thing year think lovely wonder blue hundred little blossom know simple thought fill mind fill fill other thing push sweet clear spring begin rise stagnant pool rise rise last sweep dark water course think know valley seem grow quiet quiet sit stare bright delicate blueness know sit happen last move awaken get stand moss carpet draw long deep soft breath wonder seem unbound release

11,I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to be able to explain how this had happened to him.  Neither does any one else yet.

12,"""I am going to live forever and ever and ever!""",go live 
13,"The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he slept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long.  He did not know that it could be kept.  By the next night he had opened the doors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing back.  He left the valley and went on his wandering way again.  But, strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes--sometimes half-hours--when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to lift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one. Slowly--slowly--for no reason that he knew of--he was ""coming alive"" with the garden.",singular calmness remain rest evening sleep new reposeful sleep know keep next night open door dark thought come troop rush leave valley go wonder way strange seem be minute half hour know black burden seem lift know living man dead one reason know come alive garden 
14,"As the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the Lake of Como.  There he found the loveliness of a dream.  He spent his days upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the soft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that he might sleep.  But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew, and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.",golden summer change deep golden autumn go find loveliness dream spend day crystal blueness lake walk soft thick verdure hill tramp tired sleep time begin sleep know dream cease terror 
15,"""Perhaps,"" he thought, ""my body is growing stronger.""",think body grow strong 
16,"It was growing stronger but--because of the rare peaceful hours when his thoughts were changed--his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. He began to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home. Now and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what he should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed again and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it slept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes. He shrank from it.",grow strong rare peaceful hour thought change soul grow strong begin think wonder go wonder boy ask feel go stand carve post bed look chisel ivory white face sleep black lash rimm close shut eye shrank 
17,One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon was high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver.  The stillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not go into the villa he lived in.  He walked down to a little bowered terrace at the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenly scents of the night.  He felt the strange calmness stealing over him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.,marvel day walk return moon high full world purple shadow silver stillness lake shore wood wonderful go villa live walk little bower terrace water edge sit seat breathe heavenly scent night feel strange calmness steal grow deep deep fall asleep 
18,"He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his dream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming.  He remembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought he was.  He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late roses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a voice calling.  It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemed very far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very side.",know fall asleep begin dream dream real feel dreaming remember wide awake alert think think sit breathe scent late rose listen lap water foot hear voice call sweet clear happy seem hear very side

23,"And then the dream ended.  But he did not awaken.  He slept soundly and sweetly all through the lovely night.  When he did awake at last it was brilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him.  He was an Italian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa were, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign master might do.  No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in the boat on the lake all night.  The man held a salver with some letters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them.  When he had gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and looking at the lake.  His strange calm was still upon him and something more--a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened as he thought--as if something had changed.  He was remembering the dream--the real--real dream.",dream end awake sleep lovely night awake last brilliant morning servant stand stare italian servant accustom servant villa accept question strange thing foreign master do know go come choose sleep roam garden lie boat lake night man hold salver letter wait take go sit few moment hold hand look lake strange calm lightness cruel thing do happen think change remember dream real real dream

25,"When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one lying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from Yorkshire.  It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a hand he knew.  He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the first words attracted his attention at once.",glance letter few minute see one lie top rest english letter come direct plain woman hand hand know open think writer first word attract attention

31,And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to prepare for his return to England.,go garden villa order prepare return 
32," In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad journey he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in all the ten years past.  During those years he had only wished to forget him.  Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of him constantly drifted into his mind.  He remembered the black days when he had raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was dead.  He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at last it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been sure it would die in a few days.  But to the surprise of those who took care of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it would be a deformed and crippled creature.",few day long railroad journey find think boy think year past year wish forget intend think memory drift mind remember black day rave madman child alive mother dead refuse see go look last weak wretched thing sure die few day surprise take care day pass live believe deform crippled creature 
33,"He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father at all.  He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had shrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his own misery.  The first time after a year's absence he returned to Misselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and indifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes round them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had adored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as death.  After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep, and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a vicious, hysterical, half-insane temper.  He could only be kept from furies dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.",mean bad father feel father supply doctor nurse luxury shrink mere thought boy bury own misery first time year absence return small miserable look thing lift face great gray eye black lash happy eye adore bear sight turn pale death see asleep know confirm invalid vicious hysterical half insane temper keep furie dangerous give own way detail

36,"Of course this was the wrong Magic--to begin by saying ""too late."" Even Colin could have told him that.  But he knew nothing of Magic--either black or white.  This he had yet to learn.  He wondered if Susan Sowerby had taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature had realized that the boy was much worse--was fatally ill.  If he had not been under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession of him he would have been more wretched than ever.  But the calm had brought a sort of courage and hope with it.  Instead of giving way to thoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in better things.",course wrong begin say late tell know black white have learn wonder take courage write motherly creature realize boy bad ill spell curious calmness take possession wretch calm bring sort courage hope give way thought bad find try believe good thing

38,"But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the cottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a group and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him that their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the morning to help a woman who had a new baby.  ""Our Dickon,"" they volunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where he went several days each week.",way moor stop carriage cottage child play gather group bob friendly polite curtsy tell mother go other side moor morning help woman have new baby volunteer work garden go several day week 
39,"Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round red-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he awoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot.  He smiled at their friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and gave it to ""our 'Lizabeth Ellen"" who was the oldest.",look collection sturdy little body round red cheeked face one grinn own particular way awoke fact healthy likable lot smile friendly grin take golden sovereign pocket give old

42,"The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing. Why did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been sure he could never feel again--that sense of the beauty of land and sky and purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing, nearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six hundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering to think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed with the brocaded hangings.  Was it possible that perhaps he might find him changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his shrinking from him?

44,When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the usual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to the remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher.

You never knew, sir, perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken.  The things we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave a body trembling like a leaf.  He'd throw himself into such a state that Dr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him.  Well, sir, just without warning--not long after one of his worst tantrums he suddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan Sowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair.

59,"He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was standing in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went out of the room.  He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in the shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds.  The fountain was playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.  He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.  He did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path.  He felt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken, and he did not know why.  As he drew near to it his step became still more slow.  He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick over it--but he did not know exactly where it lay--that buried key.",have make effort bring place stand feel earth turn go room take way do door shrubbery laurel fountain bed fountain play encircle bed brilliant autumn flower cross lawn turn long ivied wall walk eye path feel draw place have forsaken know draw step become slow know door ivy hang thick know lay bury key

61,"The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs, no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years--and yet inside the garden there were sounds.  They were the sounds of running scuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they were strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices--exclamations and smothered joyous cries.  It seemed actually like the laughter of young things, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to be heard but who in a moment or so--as their excitement mounted--would burst forth.  What in heaven's name was he dreaming of--what in heaven's name did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things which were not for human ears?

62,"And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds forgot to hush themselves.  The feet ran faster and faster--they were nearing the garden door--there was quick strong young breathing and a wild outbreak of laughing shows which could not be contained--and the door in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back, and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the outsider, dashed almost into his arms.",moment come uncontrollable moment sound forget hush foot run fast fast near garden door be quick strong young breathing wild outbreak laugh show contain door wall flung open sheet ivy swing boy burst full speed see outsider dash arm

64,"He was a tall boy and a handsome one.  He was glowing with life and his running had sent splendid color leaping to his face.

He remembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at this season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves. Late roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an embowered temple of gold.
