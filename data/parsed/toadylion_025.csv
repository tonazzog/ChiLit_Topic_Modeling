3,"""With Prissy you can't never tell. Like as not she may go and pray that Nipper Donnan may get converted, or die and go to heaven, or something like that.

5,"""She would, indeed,"" said Hugh John, nodding his head vehemently; ""she's good no end, our Prissy is. And never shirks prayers, nor forgets altogether, nor even says them in bed. I believe she'd get up on a frosty night and say them without a fire--she would, I'm telling you. And she doats on these nasty Smoutchies. She'd just love to have been tortured. She'd have regularly spread herself on forgiving them too, our Priss would.""",say nodd head good end prissy shirk prayer forget say bed believe get frosty night say fire tell doat nasty love torture spread forgive 
6,"""I wouldn't have forgived them,"" cried the piping voice of Toady Lion, suddenly appearing through the shrubbery (his own more excellent form was ""scrubbery""), with his arms full of the new brass cannons; ""I wouldn't have forgived them a bit.

15,"Cissy was very angry. Things appeared to be particularly horrid that afternoon. She had started out to help everybody, and had only managed to quarrel with them. Even her own familiar Hugh John had lifted up his heel against her. It was the last straw. But she was resolved to not give in now.",angry thing appear horrid afternoon start help manage quarrel own familiar lift heel last straw resolve give

17,"Hugh John made a rush at this point. There was a wild scurry of flight, and the gravel flew every way. Cissy was captured behind the stable, and Hugh John was about to administer punishment. His hand was doubled. It was drawn back.",make rush point be wild scurry flight gravel fly way capture stable about administer punishment hand double draw

It was only a peck which reached land at the top corner of his ear; but it made Hugh John crimson hotly, and fend Cissy off with his elbow as if she had been a big boy about to strike.",go kiss peck reach land top corner ear make crimson fend elbow big boy about strike 
26,"""There, now,"" she said, ""I've done it. I promised I would, and what's more, I'll say it out loud--'I love you!' There! And if you don't mind and behave, I'll tell people. I will, now then.

30,"Cissy promptly hoped she might come to an early grave in the event of again betraying, even in private, the exuberance of her young affection.",hope come early grave event betray private exuberance young affection 
31,"""Now, Hugh John,"" said Cissy, when peace had been restored in this manner, and they were wandering amicably across the back meadow where they could not be seen from the house windows, taking alternate sucks at a stick of brown toffee with crumbs stuck firmly on it, the property of Cissy, ""I've something to tell you. I've found the allies for you; and we can whop the Smoutchies and take the castle now--any time.""",say peace restore manner wonder back meadow see house window take alternate suck stick brown toffee crumb stick property have tell find ally whop take castle time

33,"""If that's true,"" he said, ""you can kiss me again--no, not now,"" he added hastily, moving off a little, ""but after, when it's all over, you know. There's a good place behind the barn. You can do it there if you like.""",true say kiss add move little know be good place barn do like

40,"""Well?"" said he expectantly, his mind altogether on the campaign.",say mind campaign 
41,"Cissy told him all about the gipsy encampment and the history of the meeting with Billy Blythe. Hugh John nodded. Of course he knew all about that, but would they join? Were they not rather on the side of the Smoutchies? They looked as if they would be.",tell gipsy encampment history meeting nod course know join side look 
42,"""Oh, you can't never tell a bit beforehand,"" said Cissy eagerly. ""They just hate the town boys; and Bill Blythe says that Nipper Donnan's father said, that when the town got the castle they would soon clear the gipsies off your common--for that goes with the castle.""",tell bit say hate town boy say father say town get castle clear gipsie common go castle 
43,"Hugh John nodded again more thoughtfully. There was certainly something in that. He had heard his father say as much to his lawyer when he himself was curled up on the sofa, pretending to read Froissart's ""Chronicles,"" but really listening as hard as ever he could.",nod be hear father say much lawyer curl sofa pretend read listen 
44,"""You are a brick,"" he cried, ""you are indeed, Cissy. Come on, let's go at once and see Billy Blythe.""",brick cry come let go see

48,"""Well, I won't ask you till after,"" she said regretfully.

52,"""Just a little one to be going on with?"" she pleaded.",little one go plead 
53,"Hugh John sighed. Girls were incomprehensible. Prissy liked church and being washed. Cissy, of whom he had more hopes, liked kissing.",sigh girl incomprehensible prissy like church wash have more hope like kiss 
54,"""Well,"" he said, ""goodness knows why you like it. I'm sure I don't and never shall. But--""",say goodness know like sure 
55,"He ran to the corner and looked round into the stable-yard. All was quiet along the Potomac. He walked more sternly to the other corner, and glanced into the orchard. Peace reigned among the apple-trees. He came slowly and dejectedly back. In the inmost corner of the angle of the stable, and behind the thickest of the ivy bush, he straightened himself up and compressed his lips, as he had done when the Smoutchies were tying him up by the thumbs. He felt however that to beat Nipper Donnan he was ready to undergo anything--even this. No sacrifice was too great.",run corner look stable yard quiet walk other corner glance orchard peace reign apple tree come inmost corner angle stable thickest ivy bush straighten compress lip do tie thumb feel beat ready undergo sacrifice great

57,"Cissy was thirteen, and tall for her age, but though fully a year younger, Hugh John was tall also, so that when she came joyously forward and put her hands on his shoulders, their eyes were exactly on a level.",tall age year young tall come put hand shoulder eye level 
58,"""You needn't go shutting your eyes and holding your breath, as if it were medicine. 'Tisn't so very horrid,"" said Cissy, with her hands still on his shoulder.",go shut eye hold breath medicine horrid say hand shoulder 
59,"""Go on!"" said Hugh John in a muffled voice, nerving himself for the coming crisis.",go say muffled voice nerve come crisis 
60,"Cissy's lips just touched his, rested a moment, and were gone.",lip touch rest moment gone 
61,"Hugh John let out his breath with a sigh of relief like an explosion; then he stepped back, and promptly wiped off love's gage with the sleeve of his coat.",let breath sigh relief explosion step wipe love gage sleeve coat 
62,"""Hold on,"" cried Cissy; ""that isn't fair. You know it ain't!""",hold cry fair know 
63,Hugh John knew it and submitted.,know submit 
64,"Cissy swept the tumbled hair from about her eyes. She had a very red spot on either cheek; but she had made up her mind, and was going through with it properly now.",sweep tumble hair eye have red spot cheek make mind go

66,"""Oh, I don't mind,"" she said; ""I can easily do it over again--for keeps this time, mind!""",mind say do keep time mind 
67,"Then she kissed him once, twice, and three times. It was nicer than kissing Janet Sheepshanks, he thought; and as for Prissy--well, that was different too.",kiss time nice kiss think different 
68,"A little hammer thumped in his heart, and made it go ""jumpetty-jump,"" as if it were lame, or out of breath, or had one leg shorter than the other. After all Ciss was the nicest girl there was, if she did behave stupidly and tiresomely about this. ""Just once?"" He would do it after all. It wasn't much to do--to give Cissy such a treat.",little hammer thump heart make go jumpetty jump lame breath have leg short other nice girl behave do much do give treat 
69,"So he put his arms about her neck underneath her curls, pulled her close up to him, and kissed her. It felt funny, but rather nice. He did not remember doing that to any one since he was a little boy, and his mother used to come and say ""Good-night"" to him. Then he opened his arms and pushed Cissy away. They walked out through the orchard yards apart, as if they had just been introduced. Cissy's eyes were full of the happiness of love's achievement. As for Hugh John, he was crimson to the neck and felt infinitely degraded in his own estimation.",put arm neck curl pull kiss feel funny nice remember do one little boy mother use come say good night open arm push walk orchard yard introduce eye full happiness love achievement crimson neck feel degrade own estimation 
70,"They came to the orchard wall, where there was a stile which led in the direction of Oaklands. Cissy ran up the rude steps, but paused on the top instead of going over. Hugh John was looking the other way. Somehow, do what he would, his eyes could not be brought to meet hers.",come orchard wall be stile lead direction run rude step pause top go look other way do eye bring meet 
71,"""Are you not coming?"" she said coaxingly.",come say 
72,"""No,"" he answered, gruffly enough; ""to-morrow will do for Billy.""",answer do 
73,"""Good-night,"" she said softly. Her voice was almost a whisper.",good night say voice whisper 
74,Hugh John grunted inarticulately.,grunt 
75,"""Look here!"" she said, bending down till her eyes were on a level with his chin. He could not help glancing up once. There was a mischievous smile in them. It had never struck him before that Cissy was very pretty. But somehow now he was glad that she was. Prissy was nice-looking too--but, oh! quiet different. He continued to look at Cissy Carter standing with the stile between them.",look say bending eye level chin help glance be mischievous smile strike pretty glad prissy nice look quiet different continue look stand stile 
76,"""Wasn't it splendid!"" she said, still keeping her shining eyes on his.",splendid say keep shine eye 
77,"""Oh, middling,"" said Hugh John, and turning on his heel he went into the stable without even saying ""Good-bye."" Cissy watched him with a happy smile on her face. Love was her fetish--her Sambo Soulis--and she had worshipped long in secret. Till now she had let the worm concealment prey upon her cheek. True, it had not as yet affected her appetite nor kept her a moment awake.",middle say turn heel go stable say good bye watch happy smile face fetish worship secret let worm concealment prey cheek true affect appetite keep moment 
78,"But now all was different. Her heart sang, and the strangest thing was that all the landscape, the fields and woods, and everything seemed to be somehow painted in brighter colours. In fact, they looked just as they do when you bend down and look at them through between your legs. You know the way.",different heart sing strangest thing landscape field wood seem paint bright colour fact look do bend look leg know way
