1,CHAPTER 6. The Arrival Of Clive.,chapter 
2," ""I have nearly brought down the story to the present time,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""One event has taken place, however, which was of importance. Muzaffar Jung set out for Hyderabad, accompanied by a French contingent under Bussy. On the way, the chiefs who had conspired against Nazir Jung mutinied against his successor. Muzaffar charged them with his cavalry. Two of the three chief conspirators were killed and, while pursuing the third, Muzaffar was himself killed.",bring story present time say event take place importance set accompany french contingent way chief conspire mutiny successor charge cavalry chief conspirator kill pursue third kill 
3,"""Bussy at once released from confinement a son of Nazir Jung, proclaimed him Subadar of the Deccan, escorted him to Hyderabad, and received from him the cession of considerable fresh grants of territory to the French. The latter were now everywhere triumphant, and Trichinopoli and Tanjore were, with the three towns held by the English, the sole places which resisted their authority. Muhammud Ali, deeming further resistance hopeless, had already opened negotiations with Dupleix for the surrender of Trichinopoli. Dupleix agreed to his conditions; but when Muhammud Ali found that Count Bussy, with the flower of the French force, had been despatched to Hyderabad, he gained time by raising fresh demands, which would require the ratification of the subadar.",release confinement son proclaim escort receive cession considerable fresh grant territory latter triumphant town hold sole place resist authority deem further resistance hopeless open negotiation surrender agree condition find flower french force despatch gain time raise fresh demand require ratification subadar 
4,"""Luckily for us Mr. Floyer had been recalled, and his place taken by Mr. Saunders; who is, everyone says, a man of common sense and determination. Muhammud Ali urged upon him the necessity for the English to make common cause with him against the enemy, for if Trichinopoli fell, it would be absolutely impossible for the English to resist the French and their allies. Early this year, then, Mr. Saunders assured him that he should be assisted with all our strength, and Muhammud Ali thereupon broke off the negotiations with the French.",recall place take say man common sense determination urge necessity make common cause enemy fall impossible resist french ally year assure assist strength break negotiation 
5,"""Most unfortunately for us, Major Lawrence had gone home to England on sick leave. Captain Gingen, who now commands our troops, is a wretched substitute for him. Captain Cope is no better.",go sick leave command troops wretched substitute good 
6,"""Early this year Mr. Saunders sent Cope, with two hundred and eighty English and three hundred Sepoys, to Trichinopoli. Benefiting by the delay which was caused before Dupleix, owing to the absence of his best troops at Hyderabad, could collect an army, Cope laid siege to Madura, but was defeated and had to abandon his guns. Three thousand of Muhammud Ali's native troops thereupon deserted to the enemy.",year send english benefit delay cause ow absence good troops collect army lay siege defeat have abandon gun native troops desert enemy 
7,"""The cause of the English now appeared lost. Dupleix planted the white flags, emblems of the authority of France, in the fields within sight of Fort Saint David. With immense efforts, Mr. Saunders put into the field five hundred English troops, a thousand Sepoys, a hundred Africans, and eight guns; under the command of Captain Gingen, whose orders were to follow the movements of the army with which D'Auteuil and Chunda Sahib were marching against Trichinopoli.",cause appear lose plant white flag emblem authority field sight immense effort put field english troops gun command order follow movement army march 
8,"""Luckily Chunda Sahib, instead of doing so at once, moved northwards to confirm his authority in the towns of North and South Arcot, and to raise additional levies. Great delay was caused by this. On arriving before the important fortress of Valkonda, Chunda Sahib found before it the troops of Captain Gingen, who had been reinforced by sixteen hundred troops from Trichinopoli. The governor of the place, not knowing which party was the stronger, refused to yield to either; and for a fortnight the armies lay at a short distance from each other, near the fortress, with whose governor both continued their negotiations.",do move confirm authority town raise additional levy great delay cause arrive important fortress find troops reinforce troops governor place know party strong refuse yield fortnight army lay short distance other fortress governor continue negotiation 
9,"""Gingen then lost patience and attacked the place, but was repulsed, and the governor at once admitted the French within the fortress. The next day the main body of the French attacked us, the guns of the fortress opening fire upon us at the same time. Our men, a great portion of whom were recruits just joined from England, fell into a panic and bolted, abandoning their allies and leaving their guns, ammunition, and stores in the hands of the enemy.",lose patience attack place repulse governor admit fortress next day main body attack gun fortress open fire same time man great portion recruit join fall panic bolt abandon ally leave gun ammunition store hand enemy 
10,"""Luckily, D'Auteuil was laid up with gout. If he had pressed on, there remained only the two or three hundred men under Cope to offer the slightest resistance. Trichinopoli must have fallen at once; and we, without a hundred soldiers here, should have had nothing to do but pack up and go. As it was, Gingen's beaten men were allowed to retreat quietly towards Trichinopoli.",lay gout press remain man cope offer slight resistance fall soldier have do pack go beat man allow retreat 
11,"""The next day D'Auteuil was better, and followed in pursuit, and Gingen had the greatest difficulty in reaching Trichinopoli. There, at the present moment, we lie shut up, a portion of our force only remaining outside the walls.",next day good follow pursuit have great difficulty reach present moment lie shut portion force remain wall 
12,"""The place itself is strong. The town lies round a lofty rock, on which stands the fortress, which commands the country for some distance round. Still, there is no question that the French could take it, if they attacked it. Our men are utterly dispirited with defeat. Cope and Gingen have neither enterprise nor talent.",place strong town lie lofty rock stand fortress command country distance be question take attack man dispirited defeat have enterprise talent 
13,"""At present the enemy, who are now under the command of Colonel Law, who has succeeded D'Auteuil, are contenting themselves with beleaguering the place. But as we have no troops whatever to send to its rescue, and Muhammud Ali has no friends elsewhere to whom to look for aid, it is a matter of absolute certainty that the place must fall, and then Dupleix will only have to request us to leave, and we shall have nothing else to do but to go at once. So I should advise you not to trouble yourself to unpack your luggage, for in all probability another fortnight will see us on board ship.",present enemy command succeed content beleaguer place have troops send rescue have friend look aid matter absolute certainty place fall have request leave have else do go advise trouble unpack luggage probability fortnight see board ship 
14,"""There, that's a tremendous long yarn I've been telling you, and not a pleasant one. It's a history of defeat, loss of prestige and position. We have been out fought and out diplomatized, and have made a mess of everything we put our hand to. I should think you must be tired of it. I am. I haven't done so much talking, for years.""",tremendous long yarn tell pleasant one history defeat loss prestige position fight diplomatize make mess put hand think tired do much talk year 
15,"Charlie and Peters thanked their new acquaintance, warmly, for the pains he had taken in explaining the various circumstances and events which had led to the present unfortunate position; and Charlie asked, as they stood up to say goodnight to Mr. Johnson, ""What has become of Clive, all this time?""",thank new acquaintance pain take explain various circumstance event lead present unfortunate position ask stand say goodnight become time 
16,"""After the conquest of Devikota,"" Mr. Johnson said, ""the civilians in the service were called back to their posts; but to show that they recognized his services, the authorities allowed Clive to attain the rank of captain, which would have been bestowed upon him had he remained in the military service, and they appointed him commissary to the army, a post which would take him away from the office work he hated. Almost directly afterwards, he got a bad attack of fever, and was forced to take a cruise in the Bay of Bengal. He came back in time to go with Gingen's force; but after the defeat of Valkonda he resigned his office, I suppose in disgust, and returned to Fort Saint David. In July, some of the Company's ships came in with some reinforcements. There were no military officers left at Fort Saint David, so Mr. Pigot, a member of the council, started with a large convoy of stores, escorted by eighty English and three hundred Sepoys. Clive volunteered to accompany them. They had to march thirty or forty miles to Verdachelam, a town close to the frontier of Tanjore, through which the convoy to Trichinopoli would be able to pass unopposed, but the intervening country was hostile to the English.",conquest say civilian service call post show recognize service authority allow attain rank captain bestow remain military service appoint commissary army post take office work hate get bad attack fever force take cruise come time go force defeat resign office suppose disgust return company ship come reinforcement be military officer leave member council start large convoy store escort english sepoy volunteer accompany have march mile town close frontier convoy able pass intervene country hostile 
17,"""However, the convoy passed unmolested, and after seeing it safely to that point, Pigot and Clive set out to return, with an escort of twelve Sepoys. They were at once attacked, and for miles a heavy fire was kept up on them. Seven of the escort were killed, the rest reached Fort Saint David in safety. Pigot's report of Clive's conduct, strengthened by that previously made by Major Lawrence, induced the authorities to transfer him permanently to the army. He received a commission as captain and was sent off, with a small detachment remaining at Saint David's, to Devikota.",convoy pass unmolested see point set return escort sepoy attack mile heavy fire keep escort kill rest reach safety report conduct strengthen make induce authority transfer army receive commission captain send small detachment remain 
18,"""There he placed himself under Captain Clarke, who commanded; and the whole body, numbering altogether a hundred English, fifty Sepoys, with a small field piece, marched up to Trichinopoli, and I hear managed to make its way in safety. He got in about a month ago.""",place command whole body number small field piece march hear manage make way safety get month 
19,"""And what force have we altogether, here and at Saint David's, in case Trichinopoli falls?""",force case fall 
20,"""What with the detachment that came with you, and two others which arrived about ten days back, we have altogether about three hundred and fifty men. What on earth could these do against all the force of the nawab, the subadar, and three or four thousand French troops?""",detachment come other arrive day have man earth do force nawab subadar french troops 
21,"The prospect certainly seemed gloomy in the extreme, and the young writers retired to their beds, on this, the first night of their arrival in India, with the conviction that circumstances were in a desperate position.",prospect seem gloomy extreme young writer retire bed first night arrival conviction circumstance desperate position 
22,"The next day they set to work, and at its end agreed that they should bear the loss of their situations, and their expulsion from the country, with more than resignation. It was now August, the heat was terrible, and as they sat in their shirtsleeves at their desks, bathed in perspiration, at their work of copying invoices, they felt that any possible change of circumstances would be for the better.",next day set work end agree bear loss situation expulsion country more resignation heat terrible sit shirtsleeve desk bath perspiration work copy invoice feel possible change circumstance good 
23,"The next day, and the next, still further confirmed these ideas. The nights were nearly as hot as the days. Tormented by mosquitoes, they tossed restlessly in their beds for hours, dozing off towards morning and awaking unrefreshed and worn out. When released from work at the end of the third day, Charlie and Peters strolled down together to the beach, and bewailed their hard fate.",next day next confirm idea night hot day torment mosquitoe toss bed hour doze morning awake unrefreshed wear release work end third day stroll beach bewail hard fate 
24,"""There are two ships coming from the south,"" Charlie said presently. ""I wonder whether they're from England, or Fort Saint David?""",be ship come south say wonder 
25,"""Which do you hope they will be?"" Peters said.",hope say 
26,"""I hope they're from Saint David's,"" Charlie answered. ""Even if they made a quick voyage, they couldn't have left England many weeks after us; and although I should be glad to get news from home, I am still more anxious, just at present, for news from Saint David's. Between ourselves, I long to hear of the fall of Trichinopoli. Everyone says it is certain to take place before long, and the sooner it does, the sooner we shall be out of this frightful place.""",hope answer make quick voyage leave many week glad get news home anxious present news hear fall say certain take place frightful place 
27,"After dinner they again went down to the beach, and were joined by Doctor Rae, who chatted with them as to the ships, which were now just anchoring. These had already signalled that they were from Saint David's, and that they had on board Mr. Saunders, the governor, and a detachment of troops. Already the soldiers from the Lizzie Anderson, aided by a number of natives, were at work pitching tents in the fort for the reception of the newcomers, and conjecture was busy on shore, among the civilians, as to the object of bringing troops from Saint David's to Madras, that is, directly away from the scene of action.",dinner go beach join chate ship anchor signall have board governor detachment troops soldier aid number native work pitch tent fort reception newcomer conjecture busy shore civilian object bring troops scene action 
28,"""It is one of two things,"" Doctor Rae said: ""Either Trichinopoli has surrendered and they are evacuating Fort Saint David, or they have news that the nawab is marching to attack us here. I should think it to be the latter, for Fort Saint David is a great deal stronger than this place, though the French did strengthen it during their stay here. If, then, the authorities have determined to abandon one of the two towns, and to concentrate all their force for the defence of the other, I should have thought they would have held on to Saint David's.",thing say surrender evacuate have news nawab march attack think latter great deal strong place strengthen stay authority determine abandon town concentrate force defence other think hold 
29,"""There is a boat being lowered from one of the ships, so we shall soon have news.""",be boat lower ship have news 
30,"A signal from the ship announced that the governor was about to land, and the principal persons at the factory assembled on the beach to receive him. Doctor Rae and the two young writers stood, a short distance from the party. As the boat was beached, Mr. Saunders sprang out and, surrounded by those assembled to meet him, walked at once towards the factory. An officer got out from the boat and superintended the debarkation of the baggage, which a number of coolies at once placed on their heads and carried away.",signal ship announce governor about land principal person factory assemble beach receive young writer stand short distance party boat beach spring surround assemble meet walk factory officer get boat superintend debarkation baggage number cooly place head carry 
31,"The officer was following them, when his eye fell upon Doctor Rae.",officer follow eye fall 
32,"""Ah! Doctor,"" he said, ""how are you? When did you get out again from England?""",doctor say get 
33,"""Only three or four days since, Captain Clive. I did not recognize you, at first. I am glad to see you again.""",day recognize first glad see 
34,"""Yes, I have cast my slough,"" Captain Clive said, laughing, ""and have, thank God, exchanged my pen for a sword, for good.""",cast slough say laugh thank exchange pen sword good 
35,"""You were able to fight, though, as a civilian,"" Doctor Rae said, laughing.",able fight civilian say laugh 
36,"""Yes, we had some tough fighting behind the ramparts of Saint David's, and in the trenches before Pondicherry; but we shall have sharper work, still before us, or I am mistaken.""",have tough fighting rampart trenche have sharper work mistaken 
37,"""What! Are they going to attack us here?"" Doctor Rae exclaimed.",go attack exclaim 
38,"""Oh no, just the other way,"" Captain Clive said. ""We are going to carry the war into their quarters. It is a secret yet, and must not go farther.""",other way say go carry war quarter secret go 
39,And he included the two writers in his look.,include writer look 
40,"""These are two fresh comers, Captain Clive. They came out in the same ship with me. This is Mr. Marryat, this Mr. Peters. They are both brave young gentlemen, and had an opportunity of proving it on the way out, for we were twice engaged; the first time with privateers; the second, a very sharp affair, with pirates. That ship lying off there is a pirate we captured.""",fresh comer come same ship brave young gentleman have opportunity prove way engage first time privateer second sharp affair pirate ship lie pirate capture 
41,"""Aha!"" Captain Clive said, looking keenly at the lads. ""Well, young gentlemen, and how do you like what you have seen of your life here?""",say look lad young gentleman like see life 
42,"""We hate it, sir,"" Charlie said. ""We would, both of us, a thousand times rather enlist under you as private soldiers. Oh, sir, if there is any expedition going to take place, do you think there is a chance of our being allowed to go as volunteers?""",hate sir say time enlist private soldier sir be expedition go take place think be chance allow go volunteer 
43,"""I will see about it,"" Captain Clive said, smiling. ""Trade must be dull enough here, at present, and we want every hand that can hold a sword or a musket in the field.",see say smile trade dull present want hand hold sword musket field 
44,"""You are sure you can recommend them?"" he said, turning to Doctor Rae with a smile.",sure recommend say turn smile 
45,"""Most warmly,"" the doctor said. ""They both showed great coolness and courage, in the affairs I spoke of. Have you any surgeons with you, Captain Clive? If not, I hope that I shall go with any expedition that will take place. The doctor here is just recovering from an attack of fever and will not be fit, for weeks, for the fatigues of active service.",doctor say show great coolness courage affair speak have surgeon hope go expedition take place doctor recover attack fever fit week fatigue active service 
46,"""May I ask who is to command the expedition?""",ask command expedition 
47,"""I am,"" Clive said quietly. ""You may well look surprised that an officer who has but just joined should have been selected; but in fact, there is no one else. Cope and Gingen are both at Trichinopoli, and even if they were not--"" he paused, and a shrug of the shoulders expressed his meaning clearly. ""Mr. Saunders is good enough to feel some confidence in my capacity, and I trust that I shall not disappoint him.",say look surprise officer have join select fact be else pause shrug shoulder express meaning good feel confidence capacity trust disappoint 
48,"""We are going--but this, mind, is a profound secret till the day we march--to attack Arcot. It is the only possible way of relieving Trichinopoli.""",go mind profound secret day march attack only possible way relieve 
49,"""To attack Arcot?"" Doctor Rae said, astonished. ""That does indeed appear a desperate enterprise, with such a small body as you have at your command, and these, entirely new recruits. But I recognize the importance of the enterprise. If you should succeed, it will draw off Chunda Sahib from Trichinopoli. It's a grand idea, Captain Clive, a grand idea, though I own it seems to me a desperate one.""",attack say astonished appear desperate enterprise small body have command new recruit recognize importance enterprise succeed draw grand idea grand idea own seem desperate one 
50,"""In desperate times we must take desperate measures, Doctor,"" Captain Clive said. ""Now I must be going on after the governor. I shall see you tomorrow.",desperate time take desperate measure say go governor see tomorrow 
51,"""I will not forget you, young gentlemen.""",forget young gentleman 
52,"So saying, he proceeded to the factory.",say proceed factory 
53,"It was afterwards known that the proposal, to effect a diversion by an expedition against Arcot, was the proposal of Clive himself. Upon arriving at Trichinopoli, he had at once seen that all was lost, there. The soldiers were utterly dispirited and demoralized. They had lost all confidence in themselves and their officers, who had also lost confidence in themselves. At Trichinopoli nothing was to be done, and it must be either starved out, or fall an easy prey should the enemy advance to the assault. Clive had, then, after a few days' stay, made his way out from the town, and proceeded to Fort Saint David, where he had laid before the governor the proposal, which he believed to be the only possible measure which could save the English in India.",know proposal effect diversion expedition proposal arrive see lose soldier dispirited demoralize lose confidence officer lose confidence do starve fall easy prey enemy advance assault few day stay make way town proceed lay governor proposal believe only possible measure save 
54,"The responsibility thus set before Mr. Saunders was a grave one. Upon the one hand, he was asked to detach half of the already inadequate garrisons of Fort Saint David and Madras upon an enterprise which, if unsuccessful, must be followed by the loss of the British possessions, of which he was governor. He would have to take this great risk, not upon the advice of a tried veteran like Lawrence, but on that of a young man, only a month or two back a civilian; and it was to this young man, untried in command, that the leadership of this desperate enterprise must be intrusted.",responsibility set grave one hand ask detach half inadequate garrison enterprise unsuccessful follow loss british possession governor have take great risk advice try veteran young man month civilian young man untried command leadership desperate enterprise intrust 
55,"Upon the other hand, if he refused to take this responsibility the fall of Trichinopoli, followed by the loss of the three English ports, was certain. But for this no blame or responsibility could rest upon him. Many men would have chosen the second alternative; but Mr. Saunders had, since Clive's return, seen a good deal of him, and had been impressed with a strong sense of his capacity, energy, and good sense. Mr. Pigot, who had seen Clive under the most trying circumstances, was also his warm supporter; and Mr. Saunders at last determined to adopt Clive's plan, and to stake the fortunes of the English in India on this desperate venture.",other hand refuse take responsibility fall follow loss english port certain blame responsibility rest many man choose second alternative return see good deal impress strong sense capacity energy good sense see try circumstance warm supporter last determined adopt plan stake fortune desperate venture 
56,"Accordingly, leaving a hundred men only at Fort Saint David, he decided to carry the remainder to Madras; and that Clive, leaving only fifty behind as a garrison there, should, with the whole available force, march upon Arcot.",leave man decide carry remainder leave garrison whole available force march 
57,"The next morning as Charlie and Peters were at breakfast, a native entered with a letter from the chief factor, to the effect that their services in the office would be dispensed with, and that they were, in accordance with their request, to report themselves to Captain Clive as volunteers. No words can express the joy of the two lads, at receiving the intelligence, and they created so much noise, in the exuberance of their delight, that Mr. Johnson came in from the next room to see what was the matter.",next morning breakfast native enter letter chief factor effect service office dispens accordance request report volunteer word express joy lad receive intelligence create much noise exuberance delight come next room see matter 
58,"""Ah!"" he said, when he heard the cause of the uproar; ""when I first came out here, I should have done the same, and should have regarded the certainty of being knocked on the head as cheerfully as you do. Eight years out here takes the enthusiasm out of a man, and I shall wait quietly to see whether we are to be transferred to Calcutta, or shipped back to England.""",say hear cause uproar come do same regard certainty knock head do year take enthusiasm man wait see transfer ship 
59,"A quarter of an hour later, Charlie and Peters joined Captain Clive in the camp.",quarter hour join camp 
60,"""Ah!"" he said, ""My young friends, I'm glad to see you. There is plenty for you to do, at once. We shall march tomorrow, and all preparations have to be made. You will both have the rank of ensign, while you serve with me. I have only six other officers, two of whom are civilians who, like yourselves, volunteered at Saint David's. They are of four or five year's standing and, as they speak the language, they will serve with the Sepoys under one of my military officers. Another officer, who is also an ensign, will take the command of the three guns. The Europeans are divided into two companies. One of you will be attached to each. The remaining officer commands both.""",say young friend glad see be plenty do march tomorrow preparation have make have rank ensign serve have other officer civilian volunteer year standing speak language serve military officer officer ensign take command gun divide company attach remain officer command 
61,"During the day the lads had not a moment to themselves, and were occupied until late at night in superintending the packing of stores and tents; and the following morning, the 26th of August, 1751, the force marched from Madras. It consisted of two hundred of the Company's English troops, three hundred Sepoys, and three small guns. They were led, as has been said, by eight European officers, of whom only Clive and another had ever heard a shot fired in action, four of the eight being young men in the civil service, who had volunteered.",day lad have moment occupy night superintend packing store tent follow morning 26th force march consist company english troops sepoy small gun lead say european officer hear shot fire action young man civil service volunteer 
62,"Charlie was glad to find that among the company to which he was appointed was the detachment which had come out with him on board ship; and the moment these heard that he was to accompany them, as their officer, Tim Kelly pressed forward and begged that he might be allowed to act as Charlie's servant, a request which the lad readily complied with.",glad find company appoint detachment come board ship moment hear accompany officer press begg allow act servant request lad complie 
63,"The march the first day was eighteen miles, a distance which, in such a climate, was sufficient to try to the utmost the powers of the young recruits. The tents were soon erected, each officer having two or three native servants, that number being indispensable in India. Charlie and Peters had one tent between them, which was shared by two other officers, as the column had moved in the lightest order possible in India.",march first day mile distance climate sufficient try utmost power young recruit tent erect officer have native servant number indispensable have tent share other officer column move light order possible 
64,"""Sure, Mr. Marryat,"" Tim Kelly said to him confidentially, ""that black hathen of a cook is going to pison ye. I have been watching him, and there he is putting all sorts of outlandish things into the mate. He's been pounding them up on stones, for all the world like an apothecary, and even if he manes no mischief, the food isn't fit to set before a dog, let alone a Christian and a gintleman like yourself.

68,"On the morning of the 29th Clive reached Conjeveram, a town of some size, forty-two miles from Madras. Here Clive gained the first trustworthy intelligence as to Arcot. He found the garrison outnumbered his own force by two to one; and that, although the defences were not in a position to resist an attack by heavy guns, they were capable of being defended against any force not so provided. Clive at once despatched a messenger to Madras, begging that two eighteen-pounders might be sent after him; and then, without awaiting their coming he marched forward against Arcot.",morning 29th reach town size mile gain first trustworthy intelligence find garrison outnumber own force defence position resist attack heavy gun capable defend force provide despatch messenger begg pounder send await come march
