1,CHAPTER 22. IN BURN CASTLE WOOD.,burn wood 
2,"In concentrating her thoughts of revenge on Hester Annie ceased to trouble her head about Dora Russell.  She considered Hester a crueller enemy than Dora.  Hester belonged to her own set, worked in her own class, and would naturally, had things not turned out so unjustly, so unfairly, have been her friend, and not her enemy.  Dora had nothing to say to Annie, and before Hester's advent into the school had scarcely noticed her existence.  Annie therefore concentrated all her powers on punishing Hester.  This gave her an aim and an occupation, and at first she felt that her revenge might give her real pleasure.",concentrate thought revenge cease trouble head consider crueller enemy belong own set work own class have thing turn friend enemy have say advent school notice existence concentrate power punish give aim occupation first feel revenge give real pleasure 
3,"Susan Drummond now shared Annie's bedroom, and Annie was rather startled one evening to hear this phlegmatic young person burst out into a strong tirade against Hester and Dora.  Dora had managed, for some inexplicable reason, to offend Susan, and Susan now looked to Annie for sympathy, and boldly suggested that they should get up what she was pleased to call ""a lark"" between them for the punishment of this very dignified young lady.",share bedroom startle evening hear phlegmatic young person burst strong tirade manage inexplicable reason offend look sympathy suggest get pleased call lark punishment dignified young lady

9,"""You do hate them, don't you?"" persisted Miss Drummond.",hate persist 
10,"""It's nothing to you what I feel toward them, Susy,"" said Annie. ""Please don't disturb me with any more of your chatter; I am very sleepy, and you are keeping me awake.""  Thus silenced, Susan had to content herself by turning on her back, and going into the land of dreams; but she was evidently a good deal surprised and disappointed, and began to entertain a certain respect, and even fear, of Annie, which had been hitherto unknown to her.",feel say disturb more chatter sleepy keep silence have content turn back go land dream good deal surprise disappoint begin entertain certain respect fear unknown 
11,"Meanwhile Hester was very busy, very happy, and more satisfied--brighter and better employed than she had ever been in her life before.  Nan's love satisfied the affectionate side of her nature, and all her intellect was strained to the utmost to win honours in the coming struggle.",busy happy satisfied bright employ life love satisfy affectionate side nature intellect strain utmost win honour come struggle 
12,"She had stuck firmly to her resolve to work for the English composition prize, and she firmly made up her own mind to leave no stone unturned to win it.  What affection she, possessed for Miss Russell was not at all of a character to prevent her from thoroughly enjoying taking the prize out of her hands.  Her love for Dora had been fed by vanity, and was not at all of a deep or noble character.  She was some time carefully choosing the subject of her theme, and at last she resolved to write a brief historical description of the last days of Marie Antoinette.  To write properly on this subject she had to read up a great deal, and had to find references in books which were not usually allowed as school-room property.  Mrs Willis, however, always allowed the girls who were working for the English composition prize to have access to her rather extensive library, and here Hester was often to be found during play-hours.  Two evenings in the week were also taken up in preparation for the coming plays, and as Hester was to take rather an important part in one, and a small character in another, she was obliged to devote herself to getting up her parts during the weekly half-holidays.  Thus every moment was busy, and, except at night, she had little time to devote herself to Nan.",stick resolve work english composition prize make own mind leave stone unturned win affection possess character prevent enjoy take prize hand love feed vanity deep noble character time choose subject theme last resolve write brief historical description last day write subject have read great deal have find reference book allow school room property allow girl work english composition prize have access extensive library find play hour evening week take preparation come play take important part small character oblige devote get part weekly half holiday moment busy night have little time devote 
13,"Nan slept in a pretty crib in Hester's room, and each evening the young girl knelt down by her sister's side, and gazed at her with love which was almost motherly swelling in her breast.",sleep pretty crib room evening young girl knolt sister side gaze love motherly swell breast 
14,"All that was best of Hester was drawn out at these moments; something greater than ambition--something far and away above school triumphs and school jealousies spoke then in her heart of hearts.  These moments found her capable of being both sympathising and forgiving; these moments followed out in her daily life might have made Hester almost great.  Now was the time, with her eyes full of tears and her lips trembling with emotion, for Annie Forest to have caught a glimpse of the divine in Hester; the hardness, the pride, the haughty spirit were all laid aside, and hers was the true child-heart as she knelt by the sleeping baby.  Hester prayed earnestly at these moments, and, in truth, Nan did better for her than any sermon; better for her than even Mrs Willis's best influences.  Nan was as the voice of God to her sister.",good draw moment great ambition school triumph school jealousy speak heart heart moment find capable sympathising forgiving moment follow daily life make great time eye full tear lip tremble emotion catch glimpse divine hardness pride haughty spirit lay true child heart knolt sleeping baby pray moment truth do good sermon good good influence voice sister 
15,"Hester, in her very busy life, had no time to notice, however, a very slight and almost imperceptible change in bright little Nan.  In the mornings she was in too great a hurry to pay much heed to the little one's chatter; in the afternoons she had scarcely an instant to devote to her, and when she saw her playing happily with the other children she was quite content, and always supposed that when a spare half-hour did come in her busy life Nan would rush to her with the old ecstasy, and give her the old devotion.",busy life have time notice slight imperceptible change bright little morning great hurry pay much heed little one chatter afternoon have instant devote see play other child content suppose spare half hour come busy life rush old ecstasy give old devotion 
16,"One day, toward the end of a very fine May, the girls were all to go for a picnic to some woods about four miles away.  They had looked forward for several days to this relaxation, and were in the highest state of delight and the wildest spirits.  After an early dinner they were to drive in several large waggonettes to the place of _rendezvous_, where they were to be regaled with gypsy-tea, and were to have a few hours in the lovely Woods or Burn Castle, one of the show places of the neighbourhood.  Mrs Willis had invited the Misses Bruce to accompany them, and they were all to leave the house punctually at two o'clock. The weather was wonderfully fine and warm, and it was decided that all the children, even Nan, should go.",day end fine girl go picnic wood mile look several day relaxation high state delight wild spirit early dinner drive several large waggonette place regale gypsy tea have few hour lovely show place neighbourhood invite accompany leave house o'clock weather fine warm decide child go 
17,"Perhaps none of the girls looked forward to this day's pleasure with greater joy than did Hester; she determined to make it a real holiday, and a real time of relaxation.  She would forget her English theme; she would cease to worry herself about Marie Antoinette; she would cease to repeat her part in the coming play; and she would devote herself exclusively and determinedly to Nan's pleasure.  She pictured the little one's raptures; she heard her gay shouts of joy, her ceaseless little rippling chatter, her baby glee, and, above all things, her intense happiness at being with her own Hetty for the greater part of a whole day.  Hester would ride her on her shoulder, would race with her; all her usual, companions would be as nothing to her on this occasion, she would give herself up solely to Nan.",girl look day pleasure great joy do determine make real holiday real time relaxation forget english theme cease worry cease repeat part come play devote pleasure picture little one rapture hear gay shout joy ceaseless little ripple chatter baby glee thing intense happiness own great part whole day ride shoulder race usual companion occasion give

Hastily opening a drawer, Hester pulled out a white frock, white pique pelisse, and washing hat for Nan--she meant her darling to look as charming as possible.",dinner girl fly room prepare expedition open drawer pull white frock white pique pelisse washing hat mean darling look charming possible

38,"""That will do, Alice; thank you for letting me know.""  She turned to her drawer and put back Nan's white and pretty things, and also replaced a new and very becoming shady hat which she had meant to wear herself.  In her old winter hat, and looking almost untidy for her, she walked slowly downstairs and took her place in the waggonette which was drawn up at the door.",do thank let know turn drawer put white pretty thing replace new become shady hat mean wear old winter hat look untidy walk take place waggonette draw door 
39,"Cecil Temple and one or two other girls whom Hester liked very much were in the same waggonette, but she scarcely cared to talk to them, and only joined in their laughter by a strong effort.  She was deeply wounded, but her keenest present desire was to hide any feelings of jealousy she had toward Annie from the quick eyes of her school-fellows.",other girl like same waggonette care talk join laughter strong effort wound keenest present desire hide feeling jealousy have quick eye school fellow

53,"Cecil made no remark, but set off by herself to find the little children.  Presently, standing on a little knoll, and putting her two hands round her lips, so as to form a speaking trumpet, she shouted to Hester.  Hester came slowly and apparently unwillingly toward her, but when she got to the foot of the knoll, Cecil flew down, and, taking her by the hand, ran with her to the top.",make remark set find little child stand little knoll put hand lip form speak trumpet shout come get foot knoll fly take hand run top

55,"Down in the valley about fifty yards away were the ten or twelve little children who formed the infant portion of the school.  Miss Danesbury was sitting at some distance off quietly reading, and the children, decked with flowers, and carrying tall grasses and reeds in their hands, were flying round and round in a merry circle, while in their midst, and the centre of attraction, stood Annie, whose hat was tossed aside, and whose bright, curling hair was literally crowned with wild flowers.  On Annie's shoulder stood little Nan, carefully and beautifully poised, and round Nan's wavy curls was a starry wreath of wood-anemones.  Nan was shouting gleefully and clapping her hands, while Annie balanced her slightest movement with the greatest agility, and kept her little feet steady on her shoulders with scarcely an effort.  As the children ran round and round Annie she waltzed gracefully backwards and forwards to meet them, and they all sang snatches of nursery rhymes.  When Cecil and Hester appeared they had reached in their varied collection--",valley yard little child form infant portion school sit distance read child deck flower carry tall grasse reed hand fly merry circle midst centre attraction stand hat toss bright curling hair crown wild flower shoulder stand little poise wavy curl starry wreath wood anemone shouting clap hand balance slight movement great agility keep little foot steady shoulder effort child run waltze forward meet sing snatch nursery rhyme appear reach varied collection

59,"""Isn't it pretty?  Isn't Annie sweet with children?"" said Cecil, looking round to Hester with all the admiration she felt for her friend shining in her face.  The expression, however, which Hester wore at that moment really startled Cecil: she was absolutely colourless, and presently she called aloud in a harsh, strained voice--",sweet child say look admiration feel friend shine face expression wear moment startle colourless call harsh strain voice

67,"At the first mention of the accident Cecil had flown to fetch some water, and when she and Miss Danesbury applied it to little Nan's temples, she presently sighed, and opened her brown eyes wide.",first mention accident fly fetch water apply little temple sigh open brown eye 
68,"""I hope--I trust she is not much hurt,"" said Miss Danesbury; ""but I think it safest to take her home at once.  Cecil, dear, can you do anything about fetching a waggonette round to the stile at the entrance of the wood?  Now the puzzle is, who is to take care of the rest of the little children?
