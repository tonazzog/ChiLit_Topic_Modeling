4," All these things happened several years ago at a place called Novastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale when he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days till he was fit to fly back to St. Paul’s again. Limmershin is a very quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.",thing happen several year place call tell tale blow rigging steamer go take cabin warm feed couple day fit fly quaint little bird know tell truth 
5,"Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people who have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world.",come business only person have regular business seal come summer month hundred hundred thousand cold gray sea have fine accommodation seal place world 
6,"Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place he happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for Novastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was fifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on the other seal’s neck, the other seal might get away if he could, but Sea Catch would not help him.",catch know spring swim place happen swim torpedo boat spend month fight companion good place rock close sea possible catch year old huge gray fur seal mane shoulder long wicked dog tooth heave front flipper stand more foot clear ground weight bold weigh pound scarr mark savage fight ready fight more put head side afraid look enemy face shoot lightning big tooth fix other seal neck other seal get help 
7,"Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as there were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something frightful.",chase beat seal want room sea nursery be other seal hunt same thing spring whistling bellow roar blow beach frightful 
8,"From a little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, you could look over three and a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was dotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives never came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and there were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah alone.",little hill call look half mile ground cover fighting seal surf dot head seal hurry land begin share fighting fight breaker fight sand fight smooth wear basalt rock nursery stupid unaccommodating man wife come island care tear piece young year old seal begin housekeeping go mile rank fighter play sand dune drove legion rub single green thing grow call holluschickie bachelor be 
9,"Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when Matkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea, and he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation, saying gruffly: “Late as usual. Where have you been?”",catch finish fifth fight spring soft sleek gentle eyed wife come sea catch scruff neck dump reservation say late usual 
10,"It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad. Matkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: “How thoughtful of you. You’ve taken the old place again.”",fashion eat month stay beach temper bad know good answer look cooe thoughtful take old place

14,"“I haven’t been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The beach is disgracefully crowded this season. I’ve met at least a hundred seals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting.

16,"“Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they would say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.”",holluschickie go go say afraid preserve appearance dear 
17,"Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a sharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were on the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals on the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.",catch sink head fat shoulder pretend go sleep few minute time keep sharp lookout fight seal wife land hear clamor mile sea loudest gale low counting be seal beach old seal mother seal tiny baby holluschickie fighting scuffling bleating crawl play go sea come gang regiment lie foot ground eye reach skirmish brigade fog foggy sun come make look pearly rainbow color little while 
18,"Kotick, Matkah’s baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he was all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals must be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very closely.",baby bear middle confusion head shoulder pale watery blue eye tiny seal be coat make mother look

21,"“I can’t help that,” said Matkah; “there’s going to be now.” And she sang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their babies:",help say go sing low croon seal song mother seal sing baby 
22,"     You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old,         Or your head will be sunk by your heels;      And summer gales and Killer Whales         Are bad for baby seals.",swim week old head sink heel summer gale bad baby seal

24,"Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He paddled and scrambled about by his mother’s side, and learned to scuffle out of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the two rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days, but then he ate all he could and throve upon it.",course little fellow understand word first paddle scramble mother side learn scuffle way father fight seal roll roar slippery rock use go sea get thing eat baby feed day eat throve 
25,"The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old people in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie kept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.",first thing do crawl meet ten thousand baby own age play puppy go sleep clean sand play old person nursery take notice holluschickie keep own grounds baby have beautiful playtime 
26,"When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight to their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until she heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few hundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and the babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, “So long as you don’t lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy sea, nothing will hurt you here.”",come deep sea fishing go playground call sheep call lamb wait hear bleat take straightest straight line direction strike fore flipper knock youngster head heel leave be few mother hunt child playground baby keep lively tell lie muddy water get mange rub hard sand cut scratch go swim be heavy sea hurt 
27,"Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy till they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song, and if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have drowned.",little seal swim little child unhappy learn first time go sea wave carry depth big head sink little hind flipper fly mother tell song next wave throw drown 
28,"After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always kept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks learning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and out of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water.",learn lie beach pool let wash wave cover lift paddle keep eye open big wave hurt week learn use flipper flounder water cough grunt crawl beach take catnap sand go last find belong water 
29,"Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking under the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a swash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or standing up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did; or playing “I’m the King of the Castle” on slippery, weedy rocks that just stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like a big shark’s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.",imagine time have companion duck roller come top comber land swash splutter big wave go whirl beach stand tail scratch head old person play slippery weedy rock stick wash see thin fin big shark fin drift close shore know eat young seal get head beach arrow fin jig look 
30,"Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul’s for the deep sea, by families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries, and the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. “Next year,” said Matkah to Kotick, “you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must learn how to catch fish.”",seal begin leave deep sea family tribe be more fighting nursery holluschickie play like next year say holluschickie year learn catch fish 
31,"They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how to sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all over, Matkah told him he was learning the “feel of the water,” and that tingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard and get away.",set show sleep back flipper tuck side little nose water cradle comfortable long rock swell feel skin tingle tell learn feel water tingly prickly feeling mean bad weather come swim get 
32,"“In a little time,” she said, “you’ll know where to swim to, but just now we’ll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise.” A school of porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little Kotick followed them as fast as he could. “How do you know where to go to?” he panted. The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked under. “My tail tingles, youngster,” he said. “That means there’s a gale behind me. Come along! When you’re south of the Sticky Water [he meant the Equator] and your tail tingles, that means there’s a gale in front of you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.”",little time say know swim follow wise school porpoise duck tear water little follow know go pant leader school roll white eye duck tail tingle youngster say mean be gale come sticky mean tail tingle mean be gale front head come water feel bad 
33,"This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always learning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds; how to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart like a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes ran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing all over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to jump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a ship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick did not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all that time he never set flipper on dry ground.",many thing learn learn teach follow cod halibut under sea bank wrench rockling hole weed skirt wreck lie fathom water dart rifle bullet porthole fish run dance top wave lightning racing sky wave flipper stumpy tail go wind jump foot clear water dolphin flipper close side tail curved leave fly fish bony take shoulder piece cod full speed fathom deep stop look boat ship row boat end month know deep sea fishing worth know time set flipper dry ground 
34,"One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water somewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he remembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles away, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the seal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for the same place, and they said: “Greeting, Kotick! This year we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?”",day lie asleep warm water feel faint lazy human person do spring leg remember good firm beach mile game companion play smell seaweed seal roar fighting very minute turn swim go meet score mate bind same place say greeting year holluschickie dance dance breaker play new grass get coat 
35,"Kotick’s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of it, he only said, “Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.” And so they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the old seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.",fur pure white feel proud say swim bone ach land come beach bear hear old seal father fight roll mist 
36,"That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea is full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to Lukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie romped down from Hutchinson’s Hill crying: “Out of the way, youngsters! The sea is deep and you don’t know all that’s in it yet. Wait till you’ve rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white coat?”",night dance dance yearling seal sea full fire summer night way seal leave wake burn oil flame flash jump wave break great phosphorescent streak swirl go holluschickie grounds roll new wild wheat tell story do sea talk boy talk wood nut understand go make chart ocean year old holluschickie romp cry way youngster sea deep know wait round yearl get white coat 
37,"“I didn’t get it,” said Kotick. “It grew.” And just as he was going to roll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces came from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man before, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick Booterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon, his son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea nurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the killing pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned into seal-skin jackets later on.",get say grow go roll speaker couple black haired man flat red face come sand dune see man cough lower head holluschickie bundle few yard sit stare man less chief seal hunter island son come little village mile sea nursery decide seal drive killing pen seal drive sheep turn seal skin jacket

39,"Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was an Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a prayer. “Don’t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal since--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof’s ghost. He was lost last year in the big gale.”",turn white oil smoke clean person begin mutter prayer touch be white seal bear old ghost lose last year big gale

41,"“Don’t look at him,” said Kerick. “Head off that drove of four-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it’s the beginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do. Quick!”",look say head drive year old man skin day beginning season new work do quick 
42,"Patalamon rattled a pair of seal’s shoulder bones in front of a herd of holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he stepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland, and they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went on playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions, and none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every year.",rattle pair seal shoulder bone front herd holluschickie stop dead puffing blow step seal begin move head try get companion hundred hundred thousand seal watch drive go play same only one ask question companion tell man drive seal way week month year

46,"The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an hour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they would get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion’s Neck, past Webster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering. He thought that he was at the world’s end, but the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel. Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick pointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions or too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made of the skin of a walrus’s throat, and then Kerick said, “Let go!” and then the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.",distance killing grounds mile take hour cover seal go fast know heat fur come patch skinned go come sight seal beach follow pant wonder think world end roar seal nursery sound loud roar train tunnel sit moss pull heavy pewter watch let drive cool minute hear fog dew drip brim cap man iron bound club foot long come point drive bit companion hot man kick heavy boot make skin walrus throat say let go man clubb seal head 
47,"Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more, for their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers, whipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough for Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with horror. At Sea Lion’s Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and rocked there, gasping miserably. “What’s here?” said a sea lion gruffly, for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.",minute little recognize friend more skin rip nose hind flipper whip throw ground pile enough turn gallop seal gallop short time sea little new mustache bristle horror great sea lion sit edge surf flung flipper overhead cool water rock gasp say sea lion rule sea lion keep

51,"“Well done for a yearling!” said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good swimming. “I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it, but if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get to know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will always be driven.”",do yearling say appreciate good swim suppose awful way look seal come year year course man get know find island man come drive

54,"Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own beach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as seals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet of rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and rock and gulls’ nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.",think good advice swim own beach haul sleep hour twitch seal head little low sheet rocky island due ledge rock gull nest walrus herd

Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: “Isn’t there any place for seals to go where men don’t ever come?”",skinned say look fancy club full drowsy old gentleman look little boy care hear more skinning see enough call be place seal go man come

Clam-eater!” He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in his life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to be a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies and the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the Puffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the cry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not have heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling and screaming “Clam-eater!

66,"Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he found that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover a quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven the holluschickie--it was part of the day’s work--and that if he did not like to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds. But none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the difference between him and his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white seal.",swim leave gull scream find sympathize little attempt discover quiet place seal tell man drive holluschickie part day work like see ugly thing go killing grounds other seal see killing make difference friend white seal 
67,"“What you must do,” said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son’s adventures, “is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have a nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another five years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.” Even gentle Matkah, his mother, said: “You will never be able to stop the killing. Go and play in the sea, Kotick.” And Kotick went off and danced the Fire-dance with a very heavy little heart.",do say old hear son adventure grow big seal father have nursery beach leave year able fight gentle mother say able stop killing go play sea go dance dance heavy little heart 
68,"That autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone because of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow, if there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet island with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not get at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to the South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day and a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that he could fancy.",autumn leave beach set notion bullet head go find be person sea go find quiet island good firm beach seal live man get explore explore swim much mile day night meet more adventure tell escape catch spotted meet untrustworthy ruffian loaf sea heavy polite fish scarlet spot scallop moor place hundred year grow proud meet find island fancy 
69,"If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play on, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down blubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that seals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew that where men had come once they would come again.",beach good hard slope seal play be smoke whaler horizon boil blubber know mean see seal visit island kill know man come come 
70,"He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that Kerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick went down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as he pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once been a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he visited.",pick old stumpy tail albatross tell very place peace quiet go smash piece wicked black cliff heavy sleet storm lightning thunder pull gale see be seal nursery other island visit 
71,"Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five seasons exploring, with a four months’ rest each year at Novastoshnah, when the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary islands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator, where he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands, the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough’s Island, Bouvet’s Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea told him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that was when he was coming back from Gough’s Island), he found a few hundred mangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.",give long list say spend season explore month rest year holluschickie use make fun imaginary island go horrid dry place bake death go little little speck island good tell same thing seal come island time man kill swim thousand mile get place call come find few mangy seal rock tell man come 
72,"That nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his own beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of green trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick caught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. “Now,” said Kotick, “I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens with the holluschickie I shall not care.”",break heart head own beach way haul island full green tree find old old seal die catch fish tell sorrow say go drive killing pen holluschickie care 
73,"The old seal said, “Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand there was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come out of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old, and I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.”",old seal say try more last lost day man kill story beach day white seal come lead seal person quiet place old live see day other try more 
74,"And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, “I am the only white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the only seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.”",curl mustache beauty say only white seal bear beach only seal black white think look new island 
75,"This cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that summer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for he was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly white mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his father. “Give me another season,” he said. “Remember, Mother, it is always the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.”",cheer come summer mother begg marry settle holluschick full grow sea catch curly white mane shoulder heavy big fierce father give season say remember mother seventh wave go farthest beach 
76,"Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put off marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with her all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last exploration. This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the trail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred pounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till he was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently bumped on a weed-bed, he said, “Hm, tide’s running strong tonight,” and turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched. Then he jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.",be seal think put marry next year dance dance night set last exploration time go fall trail great shoal halibut need least pound fish day keep good condition chase tired curl go sleep hollow ground swell set know coast midnight feel bump weed bed say tide run strong tonight turn water open eye stretch jump cat see huge thing nose shoal water browse heavy fringe weed 
77,"“By the Great Combers of Magellan!” he said, beneath his mustache. “Who in the Deep Sea are these people?”",great say mustache deep person 
78,"They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish, squid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between twenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a shovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet leather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw, and they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they weren’t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front flippers as a fat man waves his arm.",walrus sea lion seal bear whale shark fish squid scallop see foot long have hind flipper shovel like tail look whitlle wet leather head foolish look thing see balance end tail deep water graze bow other wave front flipper fat man wave arm 
79,"“Ahem!” said Kotick. “Good sport, gentlemen?” The big things answered by bowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began feeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces that they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with a whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into their mouths and chumped solemnly.",say good sport gentleman big thing answer bow wave flipper begin feed see upper lip split piece twitch foot bring whole bushel seaweed split tuck stuff mouth chump 
80,"“Messy style of feeding, that,” said Kotick. They bowed again, and Kotick began to lose his temper. “Very good,” he said. “If you do happen to have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn’t show off so. I see you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.” The split lips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did not speak.",messy style feeding say bow begin lose temper good say happen have extra joint front flipper show see bow like know name split lip move twitch glassy green eye stare speak 
81,“Well!” said Kotick. “You’re the only people I’ve ever met uglier than Sea Vitch--and with worse manners.”,say only person meet ugly bad manners 
82,"Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed to him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled backward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.",remember flash gull scream little yearling tumble water know find last 
83,"The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed, and Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked up in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as human beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk. He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven, and they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even to his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.",sea cow go schlooping graze chump weed ask question language pick travel talk many language human being sea cow answer talk have bone neck have say sea prevent speak companion know have extra joint foreflipper wave make answer sort clumsy telegraphic code 
84,"By daylight Kotick’s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone where the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very slowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and Kotick followed them, saying to himself, “People who are such idiots as these are would have been killed long ago if they hadn’t found out some safe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they’d hurry.”",daylight mane stand end temper gone dead crab go begin travel stop hold absurd bow council time time follow say person such idiot kill find safe island good good same wish hurry 
85,"It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or fifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the shore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and under them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went farther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were following up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more.",weary work herd go more mile day stop feed night keep shore time swim hurry half mile go hold bowing council few hour bite mustache impatience see follow warm current water respect more 
86,"One night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for the first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick followed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow was anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff that ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the foot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they led him through.",night sink shiny water sink stone first time know begin swim follow pace astonished dream swimmer head cliff shore cliff run deep water plunge dark hole foot fathom sea long long swim want fresh air dark tunnel lead 
87,"“My wig!” he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at the farther end. “It was a long dive, but it was worth it.”",wig say rise gasp puffing open water far end long dive worth 
88,"The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of the finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long stretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make seal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men had ever come there.",sea cow separate browse edge fine beach see be long stretche smooth wear rock run mile fit make seal nursery be play grounds hard sand slope be roller seal dance long grass roll sand dune climb good know feel water deceive true sea catch man come 
89,"The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good, and then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low sandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the northward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between the islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel.",first thing do assure fishing good swim beach count delightful low sandy island half hide beautiful roll fog northward sea run line bar shoal rock let ship come mile beach island mainland stretch deep water run perpendicular cliff cliff mouth tunnel 
90,"“It’s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,” said Kotick. “Sea Cow must be wiser than I thought. Men can’t come down the cliffs, even if there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.”",time good say cow wise think man come cliff be man shoal seaward knock ship splinter place sea safe 
91,"He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was in a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new country, so that he would be able to answer all questions.",begin think seal leave hurry go explore new country able answer question 
92,"Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.",dive make sure mouth tunnel race southward sea cow seal dream place look cliff believe 
93,"He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when he hauled out just above Sea Lion’s Neck the first person he met was the seal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found his island at last.",day go swim haul neck first person meet seal wait see look eye find island last 
94,"But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young seal about his own age said, “This is all very well, Kotick, but you can’t come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember we’ve been fighting for our nurseries, and that’s a thing you never did. You preferred prowling about in the sea.”",holluschickie father other seal laugh tell discover young seal own age say come know order remember fight nursery thing do prefer prowl sea 
95,"The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his head from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a great fuss about it.",other seal laugh young seal begin twist head side side marry year make great fuss 
96,"“I’ve no nursery to fight for,” said Kotick. “I only want to show you all a place where you will be safe. What’s the use of fighting?”",have nursery fight say want show place safe use fighting 
97,"“Oh, if you’re trying to back out, of course I’ve no more to say,” said the young seal with an ugly chuckle.",try back course have more say say young seal ugly chuckle 
98,"“Will you come with me if I win?” said Kotick. And a green light came into his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.",come win say green light come eye angry have fight 
99,"“Very good,” said the young seal carelessly. “If you win, I’ll come.”",good say young seal win come 
100,"He had no time to change his mind, for Kotick’s head was out and his teeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal’s neck. Then he threw himself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook him, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: “I’ve done my best for you these five seasons past. I’ve found you the island where you’ll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks you won’t believe. I’m going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!”",have time change mind head tooth sink blubber young seal neck throw haunch haul enemy beach shake knock roar seal do good season find island safe head drag silly neck believe go teach look 
101,"Limmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten thousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life did he see anything like Kotick’s charge into the nurseries. He flung himself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the throat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best of all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with rage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was splendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past, hauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut, and upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave a roar and shouted: “He may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the beaches! Don’t tackle your father, my son! He’s with you!”",tell life see big seal fight year little life see charge nursery flung big sea catch find catch throat choke bump bang grunt mercy throw attack next see fast month big seal do year deep sea swim trip keep perfect condition good fight curly white mane stand rage eye flame big dog tooth glisten splendid look old father see tear haul grizzled old seal halibut upsetting young bachelor direction give roar shout fool good fighter beach tackle father son 
102,"Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache on end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was going to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was a gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that dared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up and down the beach side by side, bellowing.",roar answer old waddle mustache end blow locomotive seal go marry cower admire men-folk gorgeous fight fight be seal dare lift head be parade beach side side bellow 
103,"At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through the fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered nurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. “Now,” he said, “I’ve taught you your lesson.”",night northern wink flash fog climb bare rock look scatter nursery torn bleeding seal say teach lesson 
104,"“My wig!” said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was fearfully mauled. “The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up worse. Son, I’m proud of you, and what’s more, I’ll come with you to your island--if there is such a place.”",wig say old boost maul cut bad son proud more come island be place 
105,"“Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow’s tunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,” roared Kotick.",hear fat pig sea come tunnel answer teach roar

107,"Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail. All the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his wounds.",drop head shoulder shut eye white seal more red head tail same scorn look touch wound 
108,"A week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old seals) went away north to the Sea Cow’s tunnel, Kotick leading them, and the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next spring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick’s seals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow’s tunnel that more and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at once, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to turn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through, getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.",week army holluschickie old seal go tunnel lead seal stay call idiot next spring meet fishing bank seal tell such tale new beach tunnel more more seal leave course do seal clever need long time turn thing mind year year more seal go other nursery quiet shelter beach sit summer get big fatter strong year holluschickie play sea man come
