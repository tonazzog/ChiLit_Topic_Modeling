1,CHAPTER 2. THE HALF AMULET,chapter half amulet 
2,"Long ago--that is to say last summer--the children, finding themselves embarrassed by some wish which the Psammead had granted them, and which the servants had not received in a proper spirit, had wished that the servants might not notice the gifts which the Psammead gave. And when they parted from the Psammead their last wish had been that they should meet it again. Therefore they HAD met it (and it was jolly lucky for the Psammead, as Robert pointed out). Now, of course, you see that the Psammead’s being where it was, was the consequence of one of their wishes, and therefore was a Psammead-wish, and as such could not be noticed by the servants. And it was soon plain that in the Psammead’s opinion old Nurse was still a servant, although she had now a house of her own, for she never noticed the Psammead at all. And that was as well, for she would never have consented to allow the girls to keep an animal and a bath of sand under their bed.",say last summer child find embarrass wish grant servant receive proper spirit wish servant notice gift give part last wish meet meet jolly lucky point course see consequence wish wish such notice servant plain opinion old servant have house own notice consent allow girl keep animal bath sand bed

9,"She knelt before the sand-bath and held out her arms. The Psammead must have remembered how glad it had been to jump into those same little arms only the day before, for it gave a little grudging grunt, and jumped once more.",knolt sand bath hold arm remember glad jump same little arm day give little grudging grunt jump

19,‘Of course you are!’ Anthea was beginning but it interrupted her.,course begin interrupt 
20,"‘It’s very rude to interrupt,’ it said; ‘what I mean is that I’m not going to stand any nonsense, and if you think what you’ve done is to give you the right to pet me or make me demean myself by playing with you, you’ll find out that what you think doesn’t matter a single penny.

And he took me to his house and put me out of the bag into a basket with holes that I could see through. And I bit him again. And then he brought me to this city, which I am told is called the Modern Babylon--though it’s not a bit like the old Babylon--and he sold me to the man you bought me from, and then I bit them both.

The man that I bit so--the first one, I mean--went into a shop to ask how much something cost--I think he said it was a concertina--and while he was telling the man in the shop how much too much he wanted for it, I saw the charm in a sort of tray, with a lot of other things.

43,The children looked at each other and then at the Psammead. Then Cyril coughed awkwardly and took sudden courage to say what everyone was thinking.,child look other cough take sudden courage say think 
44,"‘I do hope you won’t be waxy,’ he said; ‘but it’s like this: when you used to give us our wishes they almost always got us into some row or other, and we used to think you wouldn’t have been pleased if they hadn’t. Now, about this charm--we haven’t got over and above too much tin, and if we blue it all on this charm and it turns out to be not up to much--well--you see what I’m driving at, don’t you?’",hope waxy say use give wish get row other use think pleased charm get much tin blue charm turn much see drive 
45,"‘I see that YOU don’t see more than the length of your nose, and THAT’S not far,’ said the Psammead crossly. ‘Look here, I HAD to give you the wishes, and of course they turned out badly, in a sort of way, because you hadn’t the sense to wish for what was good for you. But this charm’s quite different. I haven’t GOT to do this for you, it’s just my own generous kindness that makes me tell you about it. So it’s bound to be all right.

But we DO trust you. And I say all of you,’ she went on, ‘don’t you think it’s worth spending ALL the money, if there’s even the chanciest chance of getting Father and Mother back safe NOW?

49,"‘Of course,’ said the Psammead; ‘how else would you find the shop?’",course say find shop 
50,"So everybody got its hat. The Psammead was put into a flat bass-bag that had come from Farringdon Market with two pounds of filleted plaice in it. Now it contained about three pounds and a quarter of solid Psammead, and the children took it in turns to carry it.",get hat put flat bass bag come pound fillet plaice contain pound quarter solid child take turn carry

55,"At last they came to THE shop. It had all sorts and kinds of things in the window--concertinas, and silk handkerchiefs, china vases and tea-cups, blue Japanese jars, pipes, swords, pistols, lace collars, silver spoons tied up in half-dozens, and wedding-rings in a red lacquered basin. There were officers’ epaulets and doctors’ lancets. There were tea-caddies inlaid with red turtle-shell and brass curly-wurlies, plates of different kinds of money, and stacks of different kinds of plates. There was a beautiful picture of a little girl washing a dog, which Jane liked very much. And in the middle of the window there was a dirty silver tray full of mother-of-pearl card counters, old seals, paste buckles, snuff-boxes, and all sorts of little dingy odds and ends.",last come shop have sort kind thing window concertina silk handkerchief china vase tea- cup blue japanese jar pipe sword pistol lace collar silver spoon tie half dozen wedding ring red lacquer basin be officer epaulet doctor lancet be tea caddy inlaid red turtle shell brass curly wurly plate different kind money stack different kind plate be beautiful picture little girl wash dog like middle window be dirty silver tray full mother pearl card counter old seal paste buckle snuff box sort little dingy odd end

57,‘There’s a tray there with rubbish in it.’,be tray rubbish 
58,"And then its long snail’s eyes saw something that made them stretch out so much that they were as long and thin as new slate-pencils. Its fur bristled thickly, and its voice was quite hoarse with excitement as it whispered--",long snail eye see make stretch long thin new slate pencil fur bristle voice hoarse excitement whisper 
59,"‘That’s it! That’s it! There, under that blue and yellow buckle, you can see a bit sticking out. It’s red. Do you see?’",blue yellow buckle see bit stick red see 
60,"‘Is it that thing something like a horse-shoe?’ asked Cyril. ‘And red, like the common sealing-wax you do up parcels with?’ ‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Psammead. ‘Now, you do just as you did before. Ask the price of other things. That blue buckle would do. Then the man will get the tray out of the window. I think you’d better be the one,’ it said to Anthea. ‘We’ll wait out here.’",thing horse shoe ask red common sealing wax do parcel say ask price other thing blue buckle do man get tray window think one say wait 
61,"So the others flattened their noses against the shop window, and presently a large, dirty, short-fingered hand with a very big diamond ring came stretching through the green half-curtains at the back of the shop window and took away the tray.",other flateen nose shop window large dirty short finger hand big diamond ring come stretch green half curtain back shop window take tray 
62,"They could not see what was happening in the interview between Anthea and the Diamond Ring, and it seemed to them that she had had time--if she had had money--to buy everything in the shop before the moment came when she stood before them, her face wreathed in grins, as Cyril said later, and in her hand the charm.",see happen interview seem have time have money buy shop moment come stand face wreathe grin say hand charm

65,"So home they went. The parlour in Fitzroy Street was a very flat background to magic happenings. Down in the country among the flowers and green fields anything had seemed--and indeed had been--possible. But it was hard to believe that anything really wonderful could happen so near the Tottenham Court Road. But the Psammead was there--and it in itself was wonderful. And it could talk--and it had shown them where a charm could be bought that would make the owner of it perfectly happy. So the four children hurried home, taking very long steps, with their chins stuck out, and their mouths shut very tight indeed. They went so fast that the Psammead was quite shaken about in its fish-bag, but it did not say anything--perhaps for fear of attracting public notice.",home go parlour flat background magic happening country flower green field seem possible hard believe wonderful happen wonderful talk show charm buy make owner happy child hurry take long step chin stick mouth shut tight go shake fish bag say fear attract public notice 
66,"They got home at last, very hot indeed, and set the Psammead on the green tablecloth.",get last hot set green tablecloth 
67,‘Now then!’ said Cyril.,say 
68,"But the Psammead had to have a plate of sand fetched for it, for it was quite faint. When it had refreshed itself a little it said--",have have plate sand fetched faint refresh little say 
69,"‘Now then! Let me see the charm,’ and Anthea laid it on the green table-cover. The Psammead shot out his long eyes to look at it, then it turned them reproachfully on Anthea and said--",let see charm lay green table cover shoot long eye look turn say 
70,‘But there’s only half of it here!’,be half 
71,This was indeed a blow.,blow

73,"‘Isn’t half any good?’--‘Won’t it work without the other bit?’--‘It cost seven-and-six.’--‘Oh, bother, bother, bother!’--‘Don’t be silly little idiots!’ said everyone and the Psammead altogether.",half good work other bit cost bother bother bother silly little idiot say 
74,Then there was a wretched silence. Cyril broke it--,be wretched silence break 
75,‘What shall we do?’,do

78,"The three were watching at the windows when Cyril returned, and even before he was near enough for them to see his face there was something about the slouch of his shoulders and set of his knickerbockers and the way he dragged his boots along that showed but too plainly that his errand had been in vain.",watch window return see face slouch shoulder set knickerbocker way drag boot show errand vain

80,"‘No go,’ Cyril answered; ‘the man said the thing was perfect. He said it was a Roman lady’s locket, and people shouldn’t buy curios if they didn’t know anything about arky--something or other, and that he never went back on a bargain, because it wasn’t business, and he expected his customers to act the same.

82,"The unlikeliness of anything really interesting happening in that parlour lay like a weight of lead on everyone’s spirits. Cyril had his dinner, and just as he was swallowing the last mouthful of apple-pudding there was a scratch at the door. Anthea opened it and in walked the Psammead.",unlikeliness interesting happen parlour lay weight lead spirit have dinner swallow last mouthful apple pudding scratch door open walk

Now pay attention, because I don’t intend to tell you everything twice over.’",say seem remember sit listen ear right glad know arithmetic pay attention intend tell 
86,"As the children settled themselves on the floor--it was far more comfortable than the chairs, as well as more polite to the Psammead, who was stroking its whiskers on the hearth-rug--a sudden cold pain caught at Anthea’s heart. Father--Mother--the darling Lamb--all far away. Then a warm, comfortable feeling flowed through her. The Psammead was here, and at least half a charm, and there were to be adventures.

Still, you’ve saved my life--oh, when I think of that man and his pail of water!--so I’ll tell you all I know. At least, of course I can’t do that, because I know far too much.
