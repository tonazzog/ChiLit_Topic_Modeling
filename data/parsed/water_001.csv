5,WORDSWORTH.,
6," Once upon a time there was a little chimney-sweep, and his name was Tom.  That is a short name, and you have heard it before, so you will not have much trouble in remembering it.  He lived in a great town in the North country, where there were plenty of chimneys to sweep, and plenty of money for Tom to earn and his master to spend. He could not read nor write, and did not care to do either; and he never washed himself, for there was no water up the court where he lived.  He had never been taught to say his prayers.  He never had heard of God, or of Christ, except in words which you never have heard, and which it would have been well if he had never heard.  He cried half his time, and laughed the other half.  He cried when he had to climb the dark flues, rubbing his poor knees and elbows raw; and when the soot got into his eyes, which it did every day in the week; and when his master beat him, which he did every day in the week; and when he had not enough to eat, which happened every day in the week likewise.  And he laughed the other half of the day, when he was tossing halfpennies with the other boys, or playing leap-frog over the posts, or bowling stones at the horses' legs as they trotted by, which last was excellent fun, when there was a wall at hand behind which to hide.  As for chimney-sweeping, and being hungry, and being beaten, he took all that for the way of the world, like the rain and snow and thunder, and stood manfully with his back to it till it was over, as his old donkey did to a hail- storm; and then shook his ears and was as jolly as ever; and thought of the fine times coming, when he would be a man, and a master sweep, and sit in the public-house with a quart of beer and a long pipe, and play cards for silver money, and wear velveteens and ankle-jacks, and keep a white bull-dog with one gray ear, and carry her puppies in his pocket, just like a man.  And he would have apprentices, one, two, three, if he could.  How he would bully them, and knock them about, just as his master did to him; and make them carry home the soot sacks, while he rode before them on his donkey, with a pipe in his mouth and a flower in his button-hole, like a king at the head of his army.  Yes, there were good times coming; and, when his master let him have a pull at the leavings of his beer, Tom was the jolliest boy in the whole town.",time be little chimney sweep name short name hear have much trouble remember live great town country be plenty chimney sweep plenty money earn master spend read write care do wash be water court live teach say prayer hear word hear hear cry time laugh other half cry have climb dark flue rub poor knee elbow raw soot get eye do day week master beat do day week have enough eat happen day week laugh other half day toss halfpenny other boy play leap frog post bowl stone horse leg trotet last excellent fun be wall hand hide chimney sweeping hungry beat take way world rain snow thunder stand back old donkey do hail storm shake ear jolly think fine time come man master sweep sit public house quart beer long pipe play card silver money wear velveteen ankle jack keep white bull dog gray ear carry puppy pocket man have apprentice bully knock master do make carry soot sack ride donkey pipe mouth flower button hole king head army be good time come master let have pull leaving beer jolliest boy whole town 
7,"One day a smart little groom rode into the court where Tom lived. Tom was just hiding behind a wall, to heave half a brick at his horse's legs, as is the custom of that country when they welcome strangers; but the groom saw him, and halloed to him to know where Mr. Grimes, the chimney-sweep, lived.  Now, Mr. Grimes was Tom's own master, and Tom was a good man of business, and always civil to customers, so he put the half-brick down quietly behind the wall, and proceeded to take orders.",day smart little groom ride court live hide wall heave brick horse leg custom country welcome stranger groom see halloe know chimney sweep live own master good man business civil customer put half brick wall proceed take order 
8,"Mr. Grimes was to come up next morning to Sir John Harthover's, at the Place, for his old chimney-sweep was gone to prison, and the chimneys wanted sweeping.  And so he rode away, not giving Tom time to ask what the sweep had gone to prison for, which was a matter of interest to Tom, as he had been in prison once or twice himself. Moreover, the groom looked so very neat and clean, with his drab gaiters, drab breeches, drab jacket, snow-white tie with a smart pin in it, and clean round ruddy face, that Tom was offended and disgusted at his appearance, and considered him a stuck-up fellow, who gave himself airs because he wore smart clothes, and other people paid for them; and went behind the wall to fetch the half- brick after all; but did not, remembering that he had come in the way of business, and was, as it were, under a flag of truce.",come next morning old chimney sweep go prison chimney want sweep ride give time ask sweep go prison matter interest prison groom look neat clean drab gaiter drab breeche drab jacket snow white tie smart pin clean round ruddy face offend disgust appearance consider stuck fellow give air wear smart clothes other person pay go wall fetch half brick remember come way business flag truce 
9,"His master was so delighted at his new customer that he knocked Tom down out of hand, and drank more beer that night than he usually did in two, in order to be sure of getting up in time next morning; for the more a man's head aches when he wakes, the more glad he is to turn out, and have a breath of fresh air.  And, when he did get up at four the next morning, he knocked Tom down again, in order to teach him (as young gentlemen used to be taught at public schools) that he must be an extra good boy that day, as they were going to a very great house, and might make a very good thing of it, if they could but give satisfaction.",master delighted new customer knock hand drink more beer night do order sure get time next morning man head ache wake glad turn have breath fresh air get next morning knock order teach young gentleman use teach public school extra good boy day go great house make good thing give satisfaction 
10,"And Tom thought so likewise, and, indeed, would have done and behaved his best, even without being knocked down.  For, of all places upon earth, Harthover Place (which he had never seen) was the most wonderful, and, of all men on earth, Sir John (whom he had seen, having been sent to gaol by him twice) was the most awful.",think do behave good knock place earth see wonderful man earth see send gaol awful 
11,"Harthover Place was really a grand place, even for the rich North country; with a house so large that in the frame-breaking riots, which Tom could just remember, the Duke of Wellington, and ten thousand soldiers to match, were easily housed therein; at least, so Tom believed; with a park full of deer, which Tom believed to be monsters who were in the habit of eating children; with miles of game-preserves, in which Mr. Grimes and the collier lads poached at times, on which occasions Tom saw pheasants, and wondered what they tasted like; with a noble salmon-river, in which Mr. Grimes and his friends would have liked to poach; but then they must have got into cold water, and that they did not like at all.  In short, Harthover was a grand place, and Sir John a grand old man, whom even Mr. Grimes respected; for not only could he send Mr. Grimes to prison when he deserved it, as he did once or twice a week; not only did he own all the land about for miles; not only was he a jolly, honest, sensible squire, as ever kept a pack of hounds, who would do what he thought right by his neighbours, as well as get what he thought right for himself; but, what was more, he weighed full fifteen stone, was nobody knew how many inches round the chest, and could have thrashed Mr. Grimes himself in fair fight, which very few folk round there could do, and which, my dear little boy, would not have been right for him to do, as a great many things are not which one both can do, and would like very much to do.  So Mr. Grimes touched his hat to him when he rode through the town, and called him a ""buirdly awd chap,"" and his young ladies ""gradely lasses,"" which are two high compliments in the North country; and thought that that made up for his poaching Sir John's pheasants; whereby you may perceive that Mr. Grimes had not been to a properly-inspected Government National School.",grand place rich country house large frame break riot remember soldier match house least believe park full deer believe monster habit eat child mile game preserve collier lad poach time occasion see pheasant wonder taste noble salmon river friend like poach get cold water like short grand place grand old man respect send prison deserve do week own land mile jolly honest sensible squire keep pack hound do think neighbour get think more weigh full stone know many inch chest thrash fair fight few folk do dear little boy right do great many thing one do like much do touch hat ride town call buirdly chap young lady lass high compliment country think make poaching pheasant perceive inspect national 
12,"Now, I dare say, you never got up at three o'clock on a midsummer morning.  Some people get up then because they want to catch salmon; and some because they want to climb Alps; and a great many more because they must, like Tom.  But, I assure you, that three o'clock on a midsummer morning is the pleasantest time of all the twenty-four hours, and all the three hundred and sixty-five days; and why every one does not get up then, I never could tell, save that they are all determined to spoil their nerves and their complexions by doing all night what they might just as well do all day.  But Tom, instead of going out to dinner at half-past eight at night, and to a ball at ten, and finishing off somewhere between twelve and four, went to bed at seven, when his master went to the public-house, and slept like a dead pig; for which reason he was as piert as a game-cock (who always gets up early to wake the maids), and just ready to get up when the fine gentlemen and ladies were just ready to go to bed.",say get o'clock midsummer morning person get want catch salmon want climb alps great many more assure o'clock midsummer morning pleasantest time hour day one get tell save determined spoil nerve complexion do night do day go dinner half past night ball finish go bed master go public house sleep dead pig reason piert game cock get wake maid ready get fine gentleman lady ready go bed 
13,"So he and his master set out; Grimes rode the donkey in front, and Tom and the brushes walked behind; out of the court, and up the street, past the closed window-shutters, and the winking weary policemen, and the roofs all shining gray in the gray dawn.",master set ride donkey front brush walk court street close window shutter wink weary policemen roof shine gray gray dawn 
14,"They passed through the pitmen's village, all shut up and silent now, and through the turnpike; and then the were out in the real country, and plodding along the black dusty road, between black slag walls, with no sound but the groaning and thumping of the pit- engine in the next field.  But soon the road grew white, and the walls likewise; and at the wall's foot grew long grass and gay flowers, all drenched with dew; and instead of the groaning of the pit-engine, they heard the skylark saying his matins high up in the air, and the pit-bird warbling in the sedges, as he had warbled all night long.",pass pitmen village shut silent turnpike real country plodd black dusty road black slag wall sound groan thumping pit- engine next field road grow white wall wall foot grow long grass gay flower drench dew groan pit-engine hear skylark say matin high air pit bird warble sedge warble night 
15,"All else was silent.  For old Mrs. Earth was still fast asleep; and, like many pretty people, she looked still prettier asleep than awake.  The great elm-trees in the gold-green meadows were fast asleep above, and the cows fast asleep beneath them; nay, the few clouds which were about were fast asleep likewise, and so tired that they had lain down on the earth to rest, in long white flakes and bars, among the stems of the elm-trees, and along the tops of the alders by the stream, waiting for the sun to bid them rise and go about their day's business in the clear blue overhead.",else silent old fast asleep many pretty person look pretty asleep awake great elm tree gold green meadow fast asleep cow asleep few cloud fast asleep tired lain earth rest long white flake bar stem elm tree top alder stream wait sun bid rise go day business clear blue overhead 
16,"On they went; and Tom looked, and looked, for he never had been so far into the country before; and longed to get over a gate, and pick buttercups, and look for birds' nests in the hedge; but Mr. Grimes was a man of business, and would not have heard of that.",go look look country long get gate pick buttercup look bird nest hedge man business hear 
17,"Soon they came up with a poor Irishwoman, trudging along with a bundle at her back.  She had a gray shawl over her head, and a crimson madder petticoat; so you may be sure she came from Galway. She had neither shoes nor stockings, and limped along as if she were tired and footsore; but she was a very tall handsome woman, with bright gray eyes, and heavy black hair hanging about her cheeks.  And she took Mr. Grimes' fancy so much, that when he came alongside he called out to her:",come poor irishwoman trudg bundle back have gray shawl head crimson madder petticoat sure come have shoe stocking limp tired footsore tall handsome woman bright gray eye heavy black hair hang cheek take fancy come call 
18,"""This is a hard road for a gradely foot like that.  Will ye up, lass, and ride behind me?""",hard road gradely foot lass ride 
19,"But, perhaps, she did not admire Mr. Grimes' look and voice; for she answered quietly:",admire look voice answer 
20,"""No, thank you:  I'd sooner walk with your little lad here.""",thank walk little lad 
21,"""You may please yourself,"" growled Grimes, and went on smoking.",please growl go smoking 
22,"So she walked beside Tom, and talked to him, and asked him where he lived, and what he knew, and all about himself, till Tom thought he had never met such a pleasant-spoken woman.  And she asked him, at last, whether he said his prayers! and seemed sad when he told her that he knew no prayers to say.",walk talk ask live know think meet pleasant speak woman ask last say prayer seem sad tell know prayer say 
23,"Then he asked her where she lived, and she said far away by the sea.  And Tom asked her about the sea; and she told him how it rolled and roared over the rocks in winter nights, and lay still in the bright summer days, for the children to bathe and play in it; and many a story more, till Tom longed to go and see the sea, and bathe in it likewise.",ask live say sea ask sea tell roll roar rock winter night lay bright summer day child bathe play many story long go see sea bathe 
24,"At last, at the bottom of a hill, they came to a spring; not such a spring as you see here, which soaks up out of a white gravel in the bog, among red fly-catchers, and pink bottle-heath, and sweet white orchis; nor such a one as you may see, too, here, which bubbles up under the warm sandbank in the hollow lane by the great tuft of lady ferns, and makes the sand dance reels at the bottom, day and night, all the year round; not such a spring as either of those; but a real North country limestone fountain, like one of those in Sicily or Greece, where the old heathen fancied the nymphs sat cooling themselves the hot summer's day, while the shepherds peeped at them from behind the bushes.  Out of a low cave of rock, at the foot of a limestone crag, the great fountain rose, quelling, and bubbling, and gurgling, so clear that you could not tell where the water ended and the air began; and ran away under the road, a stream large enough to turn a mill; among blue geranium, and golden globe-flower, and wild raspberry, and the bird-cherry with its tassels of snow.",last bottom hill come spring spring see soak white gravel bog red fly catcher pink bottle heath sweet white orchis one see bubble warm sandbank hollow lane great tuft lady fern make sand dance reel bottom day night year spring real country limestone fountain old heathen fancy nymph sit cool hot summer day shepherd peep bush low cave rock foot limestone crag great fountain rise quell bubble gurgle clear tell water end air begin run road stream large turn mill blue geranium golden globe flower wild raspberry bird cherry tassel snow 
25,"And there Grimes stopped, and looked; and Tom looked too.  Tom was wondering whether anything lived in that dark cave, and came out at night to fly in the meadows.  But Grimes was not wondering at all. Without a word, he got off his donkey, and clambered over the low road wall, and knelt down, and began dipping his ugly head into the spring--and very dirty he made it.",stop look look wonder live dark cave come night fly meadow wonder word get donkey clamber low road wall knolt begin dip ugly head spring dirty make 
26,"Tom was picking the flowers as fast as he could.  The Irishwoman helped him, and showed him how to tie them up; and a very pretty nosegay they had made between them.  But when he saw Grimes actually wash, he stopped, quite astonished; and when Grimes had finished, and began shaking his ears to dry them, he said:",pick flower help show tie pretty nosegay make see wash stop astonished finish begin shake ear dry say 
27,"""Why, master, I never saw you do that before.""",master see do 
28,"""Nor will again, most likely.  'Twasn't for cleanliness I did it, but for coolness.  I'd be ashamed to want washing every week or so, like any smutty collier lad.""",likely cleanliness do coolness ashamed want washing week smutty collier lad 
29,"""I wish I might go and dip my head in,"" said poor little Tom.  ""It must be as good as putting it under the town-pump; and there is no beadle here to drive a chap away.""",wish go dip head say poor little good put town pump be beadle drive chap

31,"""I don't care for you,"" said naughty Tom, and ran down to the stream, and began washing his face.",care say naughty run stream begin wash face 
32,"Grimes was very sulky, because the woman preferred Tom's company to his; so he dashed at him with horrid words, and tore him up from his knees, and began beating him.  But Tom was accustomed to that, and got his head safe between Mr. Grimes' legs, and kicked his shins with all his might.",sulky woman prefer company dash horrid word tore knee begin beat accustom get head safe leg kick shin 
33,"""Are you not ashamed of yourself, Thomas Grimes?"" cried the Irishwoman over the wall.",ashamed cry wall 
34,"Grimes looked up, startled at her knowing his name; but all he answered was, ""No, nor never was yet;"" and went on beating Tom.",look startle know name answer go beat

37,"""I know about Vendale, and about you, too.  I know, for instance, what happened in Aldermire Copse, by night, two years ago come Martinmas.""",know know instance happen night year come 
38,"""You do?"" shouted Grimes; and leaving Tom, he climbed up over the wall, and faced the woman.  Tom thought he was going to strike her; but she looked him too full and fierce in the face for that.",shout leave climb wall face woman think go strike look full fierce face 
39,"""Yes; I was there,"" said the Irishwoman quietly.",say 
40,"""You are no Irishwoman, by your speech,"" said Grimes, after many bad words.",speech say many bad word 
41,"""Never mind who I am.  I saw what I saw; and if you strike that boy again, I can tell what I know.""",mind see see strike boy tell know 
42,"Grimes seemed quite cowed, and got on his donkey without another word.",seem cow get donkey word 
43,"""Stop!"" said the Irishwoman.  ""I have one more word for you both; for you will both see me again before all is over.  Those that wish to be clean, clean they will be; and those that wish to be foul, foul they will be.  Remember.""",stop say have more word see wish clean clean wish foul foul remember 
44,"And she turned away, and through a gate into the meadow.  Grimes stood still a moment, like a man who had been stunned.  Then he rushed after her, shouting, ""You come back.""  But when he got into the meadow, the woman was not there.",turn gate meadow stand moment man stunn rush shouting come get meadow woman 
45,"Had she hidden away?  There was no place to hide in.  But Grimes looked about, and Tom also, for he was as puzzled as Grimes himself at her disappearing so suddenly; but look where they would, she was not there.",hide be place hide look puzzled disappearing look 
46,"Grimes came back again, as silent as a post, for he was a little frightened; and, getting on his donkey, filled a fresh pipe, and smoked away, leaving Tom in peace.",come silent post little frighten get donkey fill fresh pipe smoke leave peace 
47,"And now they had gone three miles and more, and came to Sir John's lodge-gates.",go mile more come lodge gate 
48,"Very grand lodges they were, with very grand iron gates and stone gate-posts, and on the top of each a most dreadful bogy, all teeth, horns, and tail, which was the crest which Sir John's ancestors wore in the Wars of the Roses; and very prudent men they were to wear it, for all their enemies must have run for their lives at the very first sight of them.",grand lodge grand iron gate stone gate post top dreadful bogy tooth horn tail crest ancestor wear prudent man wear enemy run life very first sight 
49,"Grimes rang at the gate, and out came a keeper on the spot, and opened.",ring gate come keeper spot open 
50,"""I was told to expect thee,"" he said.  ""Now thou'lt be so good as to keep to the main avenue, and not let me find a hare or a rabbit on thee when thou comest back.  I shall look sharp for one, I tell thee.""",tell expect say good keep main avenue let find hare rabbit comest look sharp tell 
51,"""Not if it's in the bottom of the soot-bag,"" quoth Grimes, and at that he laughed; and the keeper laughed and said:",bottom soot bag laugh keeper laugh say

53,"""I think thou best had.  It's thy business to see after thy game, man, and not mine.""",think good have business see game man 
54,"So the keeper went with them; and, to Tom's surprise, he and Grimes chatted together all the way quite pleasantly.  He did not know that a keeper is only a poacher turned outside in, and a poacher a keeper turned inside out.",keeper go surprise chate way know keeper poacher turn poacher keeper turn 
55,"They walked up a great lime avenue, a full mile long, and between their stems Tom peeped trembling at the horns of the sleeping deer, which stood up among the ferns.  Tom had never seen such enormous trees, and as he looked up he fancied that the blue sky rested on their heads.  But he was puzzled very much by a strange murmuring noise, which followed them all the way.  So much puzzled, that at last he took courage to ask the keeper what it was.",walk great lime avenue full mile long stem peep tremble horn sleeping deer stand fern see such enormous tree look fancy blue sky rest head puzzle strange murmure noise follow way puzzle last take courage ask keeper 
56,"He spoke very civilly, and called him Sir, for he was horribly afraid of him, which pleased the keeper, and he told him that they were the bees about the lime flowers.",speak call afraid pleased keeper tell bee lime flower

65,"""Let well alone, lad, and ill too at times.  Thy life's safer than mine at all events, eh, Mr. Grimes?""",let alone lad ill time life safe event 
66,"And Grimes laughed again, and then the two men began talking, quite low.  Tom could hear, though, that it was about some poaching fight; and at last Grimes said surlily, ""Hast thou anything against me?""",laugh man begin talk low hear poaching fight last say 
67,"""Not now.""",
68,"""Then don't ask me any questions till thou hast, for I am a man of honour.""",ask question hast man honour 
69,"And at that they both laughed again, and thought it a very good joke.",laugh think good joke 
70,"And by this time they were come up to the great iron gates in front of the house; and Tom stared through them at the rhododendrons and azaleas, which were all in flower; and then at the house itself, and wondered how many chimneys there were in it, and how long ago it was built, and what was the man's name that built it, and whether he got much money for his job?",time come great iron gate front house stare rhododendron azalea flower house wonder many chimney build man name build get much money job 
71,"These last were very difficult questions to answer.  For Harthover had been built at ninety different times, and in nineteen different styles, and looked as if somebody had built a whole street of houses of every imaginable shape, and then stirred them together with a spoon.",last difficult question answer build different time different style look build whole street house imaginable shape stirr spoon

The centre Early English, with a huge portico copied from the Parthenon. The left wing pure Boeotian, which the country folk admired most of all, became it was just like the new barracks in the town, only three times as big. The grand staircase was copied from the Catacombs at Rome. The back staircase from the Tajmahal at Agra.  This was built by Sir John's great-great-great-uncle, who won, in Lord Clive's Indian Wars, plenty of money, plenty of wounds, and no more taste than his betters. The cellars were copied from the caves of Elephanta. The offices from the Pavilion at Brighton.",attic anglo third door second first floor right wing pure centre early huge portico copy left wing pure country folk admire most become new barrack town time big grand staircase copy back staircase build great great great uncle win indian plenty money plenty wound more taste better cellar copy cave office

74,"So that Harthover House was a great puzzle to antiquarians, and a thorough Naboth's vineyard to critics, and architects, and all persons who like meddling with other men's business, and spending other men's money.  So they were all setting upon poor Sir John, year after year, and trying to talk him into spending a hundred thousand pounds or so, in building, to please them and not himself. But he always put them off, like a canny North-countryman as he was.  One wanted him to build a Gothic house, but he said he was no Goth; and another to build an Elizabethan, but he said he lived under good Queen Victoria, and not good Queen Bess; and another was bold enough to tell him that his house was ugly, but he said he lived inside it, and not outside; and another, that there was no unity in it, but he said that that was just why he liked the old place.  For he liked to see how each Sir John, and Sir Hugh, and Sir Ralph, and Sir Randal, had left his mark upon the place, each after his own taste; and he had no more notion of disturbing his ancestors' work than of disturbing their graves.  For now the house looked like a real live house, that had a history, and had grown and grown as the world grew; and that it was only an upstart fellow who did not know who his own grandfather was, who would change it for some spick and span new Gothic or Elizabethan thing, which looked as if it bad been all spawned in a night, as mushrooms are. From which you may collect (if you have wit enough) that Sir John was a very sound-headed, sound-hearted squire, and just the man to keep the country side in order, and show good sport with his hounds.",great puzzle antiquarian thorough vineyard critic architect person like meddle other man business spend other man money set poor year year try talk spend pound building please put canny countryman want build gothic house say build say live good good bold tell house ugly say live be unity say like old place like see leave mark place own taste have more notion disturbing ancestor work disturbing grave house look real live house have history grow grow world grow upstart fellow know own grandfather change spick span new gothic elizabethan thing look spawn night mushroom collect wit sound headed sound hearted squire man keep country side order show good sport hound 
75,"But Tom and his master did not go in through the great iron gates, as if they had been Dukes or Bishops, but round the back way, and a very long way round it was; and into a little back-door, where the ash-boy let them in, yawning horribly; and then in a passage the housekeeper met them, in such a flowered chintz dressing-gown, that Tom mistook her for My Lady herself, and she gave Grimes solemn orders about ""You will take care of this, and take care of that,"" as if he was going up the chimneys, and not Tom.  And Grimes listened, and said every now and then, under his voice, ""You'll mind that, you little beggar?"" and Tom did mind, all at least that he could.  And then the housekeeper turned them into a grand room, all covered up in sheets of brown paper, and bade them begin, in a lofty and tremendous voice; and so after a whimper or two, and a kick from his master, into the grate Tom went, and up the chimney, while a housemaid stayed in the room to watch the furniture; to whom Mr. Grimes paid many playful and chivalrous compliments, but met with very slight encouragement in return.",master go great iron gate back way long way little back door ash boy let yawn passage housekeeper meet flower chintz dress gown mistake give solemn order take care take care go chimney listen say voice mind little beggar mind least housekeeper turn grand room cover sheet brown paper bid begin lofty tremendous voice whimper kick master grate go chimney housemaid stay room watch furniture pay many playful chivalrous compliment meet slight encouragement return 
76,"How many chimneys Tom swept I cannot say; but he swept so many that he got quite tired, and puzzled too, for they were not like the town flues to which he was accustomed, but such as you would find-- if you would only get up them and look, which perhaps you would not like to do--in old country-houses, large and crooked chimneys, which had been altered again and again, till they ran one into another, anastomosing (as Professor Owen would say) considerably. So Tom fairly lost his way in them; not that he cared much for that, though he was in pitchy darkness, for he was as much at home in a chimney as a mole is underground; but at last, coming down as he thought the right chimney, he came down the wrong one, and found himself standing on the hearthrug in a room the like of which he had never seen before.",many chimney sweep say sweep many get tired puzzle town flue accustom such find get look like do old country house large crooked chimney alter run anastomosing say lose way care much pitchy darkness much home chimney mole underground last come think right chimney come wrong one find stand hearthrug room like see 
77,"Tom had never seen the like.  He had never been in gentlefolks' rooms but when the carpets were all up, and the curtains down, and the furniture huddled together under a cloth, and the pictures covered with aprons and dusters; and he had often enough wondered what the rooms were like when they were all ready for the quality to sit in.  And now he saw, and he thought the sight very pretty.",see like gentlefolks room carpet curtain furniture huddle cloth picture cover apron duster wonder room ready quality sit see think sight pretty 
78,"The room was all dressed in white,--white window-curtains, white bed-curtains, white furniture, and white walls, with just a few lines of pink here and there.  The carpet was all over gay little flowers; and the walls were hung with pictures in gilt frames, which amused Tom very much.  There were pictures of ladies and gentlemen, and pictures of horses and dogs.  The horses he liked; but the dogs he did not care for much, for there were no bull-dogs among them, not even a terrier.  But the two pictures which took his fancy most were, one a man in long garments, with little children and their mothers round him, who was laying his hand upon the children's heads.  That was a very pretty picture, Tom thought, to hang in a lady's room.  For he could see that it was a lady's room by the dresses which lay about.",room dress white white window curtain white bed curtain white furniture white wall few line pink carpet gay little flower wall hang picture gilt frame amuse be picture lady gentleman picture horse dog horse like dog care much be bull dog terrier picture take fancy most man long garment little child mother lay hand child head pretty picture think hang lady room see lady room dress lay 
79,"The other picture was that of a man nailed to a cross, which surprised Tom much.  He fancied that he had seen something like it in a shop-window.  But why was it there?  ""Poor man,"" thought Tom, ""and he looks so kind and quiet.  But why should the lady have such a sad picture as that in her room?  Perhaps it was some kinsman of hers, who had been murdered by the savages in foreign parts, and she kept it there for a remembrance.""  And Tom felt sad, and awed, and turned to look at something else.",other picture man nail cross surprise much fancy see shop window poor man think look kind quiet lady have sad picture room kinsman murder savage foreign part keep remembrance feel sad awe turn look else 
80,"The next thing he saw, and that too puzzled him, was a washing- stand, with ewers and basins, and soap and brushes, and towels, and a large bath full of clean water--what a heap of things all for washing!  ""She must be a very dirty lady,"" thought Tom, ""by my master's rule, to want as much scrubbing as all that.  But she must be very cunning to put the dirt out of the way so well afterwards, for I don't see a speck about the room, not even on the very towels.""",next thing see puzzle washing stand ewer basin soap brush towel large bath full clean water heap thing washing dirty lady think master rule want much scrubbing cunning put dirt way see speck room very towel 
81,"And then, looking toward the bed, he saw that dirty lady, and held his breath with astonishment.",look bed see dirty lady hold breath astonishment 
82,"Under the snow-white coverlet, upon the snow-white pillow, lay the most beautiful little girl that Tom had ever seen.  Her cheeks were almost as white as the pillow, and her hair was like threads of gold spread all about over the bed.  She might have been as old as Tom, or maybe a year or two older; but Tom did not think of that. He thought only of her delicate skin and golden hair, and wondered whether she was a real live person, or one of the wax dolls he had seen in the shops.  But when he saw her breathe, he made up his mind that she was alive, and stood staring at her, as if she had been an angel out of heaven.",snow white coverlet snow white pillow lay beautiful little girl see cheek white pillow hair thread gold spread bed old year old think think delicate skin golden hair wonder real live person wax doll see shop see breathe make mind alive stand stare angel heaven 
83,"No.  She cannot be dirty.  She never could have been dirty, thought Tom to himself.  And then he thought, ""And are all people like that when they are washed?""  And he looked at his own wrist, and tried to rub the soot off, and wondered whether it ever would come off. ""Certainly I should look much prettier then, if I grew at all like her.""",dirty dirty think think person wash look own wrist try rub soot wonder come look pretty grow 
84,"And looking round, he suddenly saw, standing close to him, a little ugly, black, ragged figure, with bleared eyes and grinning white teeth.  He turned on it angrily.  What did such a little black ape want in that sweet young lady's room?  And behold, it was himself, reflected in a great mirror, the like of which Tom had never seen before.",look see stand little ugly black ragged figure blear eye grinn white tooth turn little black ape want sweet young lady room reflect great mirror like see 
85,"And Tom, for the first time in his life, found out that he was dirty; and burst into tears with shame and anger; and turned to sneak up the chimney again and hide; and upset the fender and threw the fire-irons down, with a noise as of ten thousand tin kettles tied to ten thousand mad dogs' tails.",first time life find dirty burst tear shame anger turn sneak chimney hide upset fender throw fire iron noise tin kettle tie mad dog tail 
86,"Up jumped the little white lady in her bed, and, seeing Tom, screamed as shrill as any peacock.  In rushed a stout old nurse from the next room, and seeing Tom likewise, made up her mind that he had come to rob, plunder, destroy, and burn; and dashed at him, as he lay over the fender, so fast that she caught him by the jacket.",jump little white lady bed see scream shrill peacock rush stout old nurse next room see make mind come rob plunder destroy burn dash lay fender catch jacket 
87,"But she did not hold him.  Tom had been in a policeman's hands many a time, and out of them too, what is more; and he would have been ashamed to face his friends for ever if he had been stupid enough to be caught by an old woman; so he doubled under the good lady's arm, across the room, and out of the window in a moment.",hold policeman hand time more ashamed face friend stupid catch old woman double good lady arm room window moment 
88,"He did not need to drop out, though he would have done so bravely enough.  Nor even to let himself down a spout, which would have been an old game to him; for once he got up by a spout to the church roof, he said to take jackdaws' eggs, but the policeman said to steal lead; and, when he was seen on high, sat there till the sun got too hot, and came down by another spout, leaving the policemen to go back to the stationhouse and eat their dinners.",need drop do let spout old game get spout church roof say take jackdaw egg policeman say steal lead see high sit sun get hot come spout leave policemen go stationhouse eat dinner 
89,"But all under the window spread a tree, with great leaves and sweet white flowers, almost as big as his head.  It was magnolia, I suppose; but Tom knew nothing about that, and cared less; for down the tree he went, like a cat, and across the garden lawn, and over the iron railings and up the park towards the wood, leaving the old nurse to scream murder and fire at the window.",window spread tree great leave sweet white flower big head suppose know care tree go cat garden lawn iron railing park wood leave old nurse scream murder fire window 
90,"The under gardener, mowing, saw Tom, and threw down his scythe; caught his leg in it, and cut his shin open, whereby he kept his bed for a week; but in his hurry he never knew it, and gave chase to poor Tom.  The dairymaid heard the noise, got the churn between her knees, and tumbled over it, spilling all the cream; and yet she jumped up, and gave chase to Tom.  A groom cleaning Sir John's hack at the stables let him go loose, whereby he kicked himself lame in five minutes; but he ran out and gave chase to Tom.  Grimes upset the soot-sack in the new-gravelled yard, and spoilt it all utterly; but he ran out and gave chase to Tom.  The old steward opened the park-gate in such a hurry, that he hung up his pony's chin upon the spikes, and, for aught I know, it hangs there still; but he jumped off, and gave chase to Tom.  The ploughman left his horses at the headland, and one jumped over the fence, and pulled the other into the ditch, plough and all; but he ran on, and gave chase to Tom. The keeper, who was taking a stoat out of a trap, let the stoat go, and caught his own finger; but he jumped up, and ran after Tom; and considering what he said, and how he looked, I should have been sorry for Tom if he had caught him.  Sir John looked out of his study window (for he was an early old gentleman) and up at the nurse, and a marten dropped mud in his eye, so that he had at last to send for the doctor; and yet he ran out, and gave chase to Tom. The Irishwoman, too, was walking up to the house to beg,--she must have got round by some byway--but she threw away her bundle, and gave chase to Tom likewise.  Only my Lady did not give chase; for when she had put her head out of the window, her night-wig fell into the garden, and she had to ring up her lady's-maid, and send her down for it privately, which quite put her out of the running, so that she came in nowhere, and is consequently not placed.",under gardener mowing see throw scythe catch leg cut shin open keep bed week hurry know give chase poor dairymaid hear noise get churn knee tumble spill cream jump give chase groom clean hack stable let go kick lame minute run give chase upset soot sack new gravell yard spoil run give chase old steward open park gate hurry hang pony chin spike aught know hang jump give chase ploughman leave horse headland jump fence pull other ditch plough run give chase keeper take stoat trap let stoat go catch own finger jump run consider say look sorry catch look study window early old gentleman nurse marten drop mud eye have last send doctor run give chase walk house beg get byway throw bundle give chase give chase put head window night wig fall garden have ring lady maid send put running come place 
91,"In a word, never was there heard at Hall Place--not even when the fox was killed in the conservatory, among acres of broken glass, and tons of smashed flower-pots--such a noise, row, hubbub, babel, shindy, hullabaloo, stramash, charivari, and total contempt of dignity, repose, and order, as that day, when Grimes, gardener, the groom, the dairymaid, Sir John, the steward, the ploughman, the keeper, and the Irishwoman, all ran up the park, shouting, ""Stop thief,"" in the belief that Tom had at least a thousand pounds' worth of jewels in his empty pockets; and the very magpies and jays followed Tom up, screaking and screaming, as if he were a hunted fox, beginning to droop his brush.",word hear fox kill conservatory acre break glass ton smash flower pot noise row hubbub babel shindy hullabaloo stramash charivari total contempt dignity repose order day gardener groom dairymaid steward ploughman keeper run park shouting stop thief belief have least pound worth jewel empty pocket very magpie jay follow screak scream hunt fox begin driop brush 
92,"And all the while poor Tom paddled up the park with his little bare feet, like a small black gorilla fleeing to the forest.  Alas for him! there was no big father gorilla therein to take his part--to scratch out the gardener's inside with one paw, toss the dairymaid into a tree with another, and wrench off Sir John's head with a third, while he cracked the keeper's skull with his teeth as easily as if it had been a cocoa-nut or a paving-stone.",poor paddle park little bare foot small black gorilla flee forest be big father gorilla take part scratch gardener inside paw toss dairymaid tree wrench head third crack keeper skull tooth cocoa nut pave stone 
93,"However, Tom did not remember ever having had a father; so he did not look for one, and expected to have to take care of himself; while as for running, he could keep up for a couple of miles with any stage-coach, if there was the chance of a copper or a cigar- end, and turn coach-wheels on his hands and feet ten times following, which is more than you can do.  Wherefore his pursuers found it very difficult to catch him; and we will hope that they did not catch him at all.",remember have father look expect have take care run keep couple mile stage coach be chance copper cigar end turn coach wheel hand foot time follow more do pursuer find difficult catch hope catch 
94,"Tom, of course, made for the woods.  He had never been in a wood in his life; but he was sharp enough to know that he might hide in a bush, or swarm up a tree, and, altogether, had more chance there than in the open.  If he had not known that, he would have been foolisher than a mouse or a minnow.",course make wood wood life sharp know hide bush swarm tree have more chance open know foolisher mouse minnow 
95,"But when he got into the wood, he found it a very different sort of place from what he had fancied.  He pushed into a thick cover of rhododendrons, and found himself at once caught in a trap.  The boughs laid hold of his legs and arms, poked him in his face and his stomach, made him shut his eyes tight (though that was no great loss, for he could not see at best a yard before his nose); and when he got through the rhododendrons, the hassock-grass and sedges tumbled him over, and cut his poor little fingers afterwards most spitefully; the birches birched him as soundly as if he had been a nobleman at Eton, and over the face too (which is not fair swishing as all brave boys will agree); and the lawyers tripped him up, and tore his shins as if they had sharks' teeth--which lawyers are likely enough to have.",get wood find different sort place fancy push thick cover rhododendron find catch trap bough lay hold leg arm poke face stomach make shut eye tight great loss see good yard nose get rhododendron hassock grass sedge tumble cut poor little finger birch birch nobleman face fair swish brave boy agree lawyer trip tore shin have shark tooth lawyer likely have 
96,"""I must get out of this,"" thought Tom, ""or I shall stay here till somebody comes to help me--which is just what I don't want.""",get think stay come help want 
97,"But how to get out was the difficult matter.  And indeed I don't think he would ever have got out at all, but have stayed there till the cock-robins covered him with leaves, if he had not suddenly run his head against a wall.",get difficult matter think get stay cock robin cover leave run head wall 
98,"Now running your head against a wall is not pleasant, especially if it is a loose wall, with the stones all set on edge, and a sharp cornered one hits you between the eyes and makes you see all manner of beautiful stars.  The stars are very beautiful, certainly; but unfortunately they go in the twenty-thousandth part of a split second, and the pain which comes after them does not.  And so Tom hurt his head; but he was a brave boy, and did not mind that a penny.  He guessed that over the wall the cover would end; and up it he went, and over like a squirrel.",run head wall pleasant loose wall stone set edge sharp corner one hit eye make see manner beautiful star star beautiful go thousandth part split second pain come hurt head brave boy mind penny guess wall cover end go squirrel 
99,"And there he was, out on the great grouse-moors, which the country folk called Harthover Fell--heather and bog and rock, stretching away and up, up to the very sky.",great grouse moor country folk call heather bog rock stretch very sky 
100,"Now, Tom was a cunning little fellow--as cunning as an old Exmoor stag.  Why not?  Though he was but ten years old, he had lived longer than most stags, and had more wits to start with into the bargain.",cunning little fellow cunning old stag year old live long most stag have more wit start bargain 
101,"He knew as well as a stag, that if he backed he might throw the hounds out.  So the first thing he did when he was over the wall was to make the neatest double sharp to his right, and run along under the wall for nearly half a mile.",know stag back throw hound first thing do wall make neatest double sharp right run wall mile 
102,"Whereby Sir John, and the keeper, and the steward, and the gardener, and the ploughman, and the dairymaid, and all the hue- and-cry together, went on ahead half a mile in the very opposite direction, and inside the wall, leaving him a mile off on the outside; while Tom heard their shouts die away in the woods and chuckled to himself merrily.",keeper steward gardener ploughman dairymaid hue cry go mile very opposite direction wall leave mile outside hear shout die wood chuckle 
103,"At last he came to a dip in the land, and went to the bottom of it, and then he turned bravely away from the wall and up the moor; for he knew that he had put a hill between him and his enemies, and could go on without their seeing him.",last come dip land go bottom turn wall moor know put hill enemy go see 
104,"But the Irishwoman, alone of them all, had seen which way Tom went. She had kept ahead of every one the whole time; and yet she neither walked nor ran.  She went along quite smoothly and gracefully, while her feet twinkled past each other so fast that you could not see which was foremost; till every one asked the other who the strange woman was; and all agreed, for want of anything better to say, that she must be in league with Tom.",alone see way go keep one whole time walk run go foot twinkle other see foremost one ask other strange woman agree want good say league 
105,"But when she came to the plantation, they lost sight of her; and they could do no less.  For she went quietly over the wall after Tom, and followed him wherever he went.  Sir John and the rest saw no more of her; and out of sight was out of mind.",come plantation lose sight do less go wall follow go rest see more sight mind 
106,"And now Tom was right away into the heather, over just such a moor as those in which you have been bred, except that there were rocks and stones lying about everywhere, and that, instead of the moor growing flat as he went upwards, it grew more and more broken and hilly, but not so rough but that little Tom could jog along well enough, and find time, too, to stare about at the strange place, which was like a new world to him.",heather moor breed be rock stone lie moor grow flat go grow broken hilly rough little jog find time stare strange place new world 
107,"He saw great spiders there, with crowns and crosses marked on their backs, who sat in the middle of their webs, and when they saw Tom coming, shook them so fast that they became invisible.  Then he saw lizards, brown and gray and green, and thought they were snakes, and would sting him; but they were as much frightened as he, and shot away into the heath.  And then, under a rock, he saw a pretty sight--a great brown, sharp-nosed creature, with a white tag to her brush, and round her four or five smutty little cubs, the funniest fellows Tom ever saw.  She lay on her back, rolling about, and stretching out her legs and head and tail in the bright sunshine; and the cubs jumped over her, and ran round her, and nibbled her paws, and lugged her about by the tail; and she seemed to enjoy it mightily.  But one selfish little fellow stole away from the rest to a dead crow close by, and dragged it off to hide it, though it was nearly as big as he was.  Whereat all his little brothers set off after him in full cry, and saw Tom; and then all ran back, and up jumped Mrs. Vixen, and caught one up in her mouth, and the rest toddled after her, and into a dark crack in the rocks; and there was an end of the show.",see great spider crown cross mark back sit middle web see come shake become invisible see lizard brown gray green think snake sting frighten shoot heath rock see pretty sight great brown sharp nosed creature white tag brush smutty little cub funny fellow see lay back roll stretch leg head tail bright sunshine cub jump run nibble paw lugge tail seem enjoy selfish little fellow steal rest dead crow drag hide big little brother set full cry see run jump catch mouth rest toddle dark crack rock be end show 
108,"And next he had a fright; for, as he scrambled up a sandy brow-- whirr-poof-poof-cock-cock-kick--something went off in his face, with a most horrid noise.  He thought the ground had blown up, and the end of the world come.",have fright scramble sandy brow whirr poof poof cock cock kick go face horrid noise think ground blow end world come 
109,"And when he opened his eyes (for he shut them very tight) it was only an old cock-grouse, who had been washing himself in sand, like an Arab, for want of water; and who, when Tom had all but trodden on him, jumped up with a noise like the express train, leaving his wife and children to shift for themselves, like an old coward, and went off, screaming ""Cur-ru-u-uck, cur-ru-u-uck--murder, thieves, fire--cur-u-uck-cock-kick--the end of the world is come--kick-kick- cock-kick.""  He was always fancying that the end of the world was come, when anything happened which was farther off than the end of his own nose.  But the end of the world was not come, any more than the twelfth of August was; though the old grouse-cock was quite certain of it.",open eye shut tight old cock grouse wash sand arab want water trodd jump noise express train leave wife child shift old coward go scream u uck murder thief fire cur u uck cock kick end world come kick kick cock kick fancy end world come happen end own nose end world come more twelfth old grouse cock certain 
110,"So the old grouse came back to his wife and family an hour afterwards, and said solemnly, ""Cock-cock-kick; my dears, the end of the world is not quite come; but I assure you it is coming the day after to-morrow--cock.""  But his wife had heard that so often that she knew all about it, and a little more.  And, besides, she was the mother of a family, and had seven little poults to wash and feed every day; and that made her very practical, and a little sharp-tempered; so all she answered was:  ""Kick-kick-kick--go and catch spiders, go and catch spiders--kick.""",old grouse come wife family hour say cock cock kick dear end world come assure come day cock wife hear know little more mother family have little poult wash feed day make practical little sharp temper answer kick kick kick go catch spider go catch spider kick 
111,"So Tom went on and on, he hardly knew why; but he liked the great wide strange place, and the cool fresh bracing air.  But he went more and more slowly as he got higher up the hill; for now the ground grew very bad indeed.  Instead of soft turf and springy heather, he met great patches of flat limestone rock, just like ill-made pavements, with deep cracks between the stones and ledges, filled with ferns; so he had to hop from stone to stone, and now and then he slipped in between, and hurt his little bare toes, though they were tolerably tough ones; but still he would go on and up, he could not tell why.",go know like great wide strange place cool fresh brace air go get high hill ground grow bad soft turf springy heather meet great patch flat limestone rock ill make pavement deep crack stone ledge fill fern have hop stone stone slip hurt little bare toe tough one go tell 
112,"What would Tom have said if he had seen, walking over the moor behind him, the very same Irishwoman who had taken his part upon the road?  But whether it was that he looked too little behind him, or whether it was that she kept out of sight behind the rocks and knolls, he never saw her, though she saw him.",say see walk moor same irishwoman take part road look little keep sight rock knoll see see 
113,"And now he began to get a little hungry, and very thirsty; for he had run a long way, and the sun had risen high in heaven, and the rock was as hot as an oven, and the air danced reels over it, as it does over a limekiln, till everything round seemed quivering and melting in the glare.",begin get little hungry thirsty run long way sun rise high heaven rock hot oven air dance reel limekiln seem quiver melt glare 
114,"But he could see nothing to eat anywhere, and still less to drink.",see eat less drink 
115,"The heath was full of bilberries and whimberries; but they were only in flower yet, for it was June.  And as for water; who can find that on the top of a limestone rock?  Now and then he passed by a deep dark swallow-hole, going down into the earth, as if it was the chimney of some dwarfs house underground; and more than once, as he passed, he could hear water falling, trickling, tinkling, many many feet below.  How he longed to get down to it, and cool his poor baked lips!  But, brave little chimney-sweep as he was, he dared not climb down such chimneys as those.",heath full bilberry whimberry flower water find top limestone rock pass deep dark swallow hole go earth chimney dwarf house more pass hear water fall trickle tinkle many many foot long get cool poor bake lip brave little chimney sweep climb such chimney 
116,"So he went on and on, till his head spun round with the heat, and he thought he heard church-bells ringing a long way off.",go head spun heat think hear church bell ring long way 
117,"""Ah!"" he thought, ""where there is a church there will be houses and people; and, perhaps, some one will give me a bit and a sup.""  So he set off again, to look for the church; for he was sure that he heard the bells quite plain.",think be church house person give bit sup set look church sure hear bell plain 
118,"And in a minute more, when he looked round, he stopped again, and said, ""Why, what a big place the world is!""",minute more look stop say big place world 
119,"And so it was; for, from the top of the mountain he could see--what could he not see?",top mountain see see 
120,"Behind him, far below, was Harthover, and the dark woods, and the shining salmon river; and on his left, far below, was the town, and the smoking chimneys of the collieries; and far, far away, the river widened to the shining sea; and little white specks, which were ships, lay on its bosom.  Before him lay, spread out like a map, great plains, and farms, and villages, amid dark knots of trees.  They all seemed at his very feet; but he had sense to see that they were long miles away.",dark wood shine salmon river left town smoking chimney colliery river widen shine sea little white speck ship lay bosom lay spread map great plain farm village dark knot tree seem very foot have sense see long mile 
121,"And to his right rose moor after moor, hill after hill, till they faded away, blue into blue sky.  But between him and those moors, and really at his very feet, lay something, to which, as soon as Tom saw it, he determined to go, for that was the place for him.",right rose moor moor hill hill fade blue blue sky moor very foot lay see determine go place 
122,"A deep, deep green and rocky valley, very narrow, and filled with wood; but through the wood, hundreds of feet below him, he could see a clear stream glance.  Oh, if he could but get down to that stream!  Then, by the stream, he saw the roof of a little cottage, and a little garden set out in squares and beds.  And there was a tiny little red thing moving in the garden, no bigger than a fly. As Tom looked down, he saw that it was a woman in a red petticoat. Ah! perhaps she would give him something to eat.  And there were the church-bells ringing again.  Surely there must be a village down there.  Well, nobody would know him, or what had happened at the Place.  The news could not have got there yet, even if Sir John had set all the policemen in the county after him; and he could get down there in five minutes.",deep deep green rocky valley narrow fill wood wood hundred foot see clear stream glance get stream stream see roof little cottage little garden set square bed be tiny little red thing move garden big fly look see woman red petticoat give eat be church bell ring be village know happen news get set policemen county get minute 
123,"Tom was quite right about the hue-and-cry not having got thither; for he had come without knowing it, the best part of ten miles from Harthover; but he was wrong about getting down in five minutes, for the cottage was more than a mile off, and a good thousand feet below.",right hue cry get come know good part mile wrong get minute cottage more mile good foot 
124,"However, down he went; like a brave little man as he was, though he was very footsore, and tired, and hungry, and thirsty; while the church-bells rang so loud, he began to think that they must be inside his own head, and the river chimed and tinkled far below; and this was the song which it sang:-",go brave little man footsore tired hungry thirsty church bell ring begin think own head river chime tinkle song sing 
125," Clear and cool, clear and cool, By laughing shallow, and dreaming pool; Cool and clear, cool and clear, By shining shingle, and foaming wear; Under the crag where the ouzel sings, And the ivied wall where the church-bell rings, Undefiled, for the undefiled; Play by me, bathe in me, mother and child.",clear cool clear cool laugh shallow dreaming pool cool clear cool clear shine shingle foaming wear crag ouzel sing ivied wall church bell ring undefiled undefiled play bathe mother child
