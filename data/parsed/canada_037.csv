2," Previous to his starting for the fort, Alfred had a hasty communication with his father and mother, in which he informed them simply that it was evident that Mary had been carried off, and that it was the opinion of Malachi and Martin, that the Angry Snake was the party to be suspected.",previous starting fort have hasty communication father mother inform evident carry opinion angry party suspect

4,"""Merely to get powder and shot as a reward for bringing her back again,"" replied Alfred; ""so there is not any thing to fear as to her being ill-treated; but if he has any other reason for what he has done, it is well known that an Indian always respects a female.

7,"Alfred then sprang upon his horse, which Martin had brought to the door, and galloped away to the fort.",spring horse bring door gallop fort 
8,"As it may be supposed, Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and Emma were in great distress; this did not, however, prevent them from listening to Martin, and supplying him with all that he requested, which was salt pork and other food for their journey, powder and shot for their rifles, etc. Having specified all that was wanted, Martin then went off to summon young Graves and Meredith; they were soon found, and when they heard the intelligence, were ready in a minute for departure. Their rifles and an extra pair of moccasins each was all that they required for the journey, and in a few minutes they accompanied Martin to the house. After they had been occupied for a little time in dividing the various articles into different packages, that each might carry his proportion, Mr. Campbell said--",suppose great distress prevent listen supply request salt pork other food journey powder shot rifle etc. specify want go summon young find hear intelligence ready minute departure rifle extra pair moccasin require journey few minute accompany house occupy little time divide various article different package carry proportion say

33,"Alfred and Captain Sinclair now dismounted: they had brought with them two of the soldiers who were well used to the woods, and excellent shots with the rifle. A hurried conversation of a few minutes took place, but time was too precious, and Alfred, embracing his father and mother, who, as they shook hands with Captain Sinclair, expressed in a melancholy way their hopes for their success, the party of seven which had been collected set off to rejoin Malachi and the Strawberry.",dismount bring soldier use wood excellent shot rifle hurry conversation few minute take place time precious embrace father mother shake hand express melancholy way hope success party collect set rejoin 
34,"Malachi and Strawberry had not been idle; the latter had run back to their lodge and procured a bow and arrows, and since that they had tracked the footmarks through the forest for more than a mile, when they had come to a small rivulet which ran through the forest. Here the trail was lost, at least it was not to be perceived any where on the opposite side of the rivulet, and it was to be presumed that, to conceal their trail, the Indians had walked in the water, either up or down, for a certain distance before they put their feet on the other side; but as it was near the time that they might expect the arrival of Alfred and the others, Malachi had returned to the spot where Alfred and Martin had left them, leaving the Strawberry to walk down and up the side of the rivulet to recover the trail. As soon as the party joined him, they and Malachi set off to where the trail had been lost, and the latter had left the Strawberry.",idle latter run lodge procure bow arrow track footmark forest more mile come small rivulet run forest trail lose least perceive opposite side rivulet presume conceal trail walk water certain distance put foot other side time expect arrival other return spot leave leave walk side rivulet recover trail party join set trail lose latter leave 
35,"There they waited some time, as the Strawberry was not in sight, and they took this opportunity of distributing the provisions and ammunition among them. Captain Sinclair, although his feelings may well be imagined, was very active in arrangements, and showed that, if his heart was smitten, his head was clear. The order of the march was settled by Malachi and him, and as soon as all was arranged, they waited impatiently for the return of the Indian girl; she came at last, and informed them that she had recovered the trail about three miles up the course of the stream, and they all started immediately. As was agreed, they kept perfect silence, and followed the newly-discovered trail for about a mile, when, on their arrival at a clear spot in the woods, where the grass was very short and dry, they were again at fault. They went over to the other side of this heath, to see if they could again fall in with it, but after half-an-hour's search, could not discover it, when they were summoned by a low whistle from the Strawberry, who had returned to the spot where the trail had been lost.",wait time sight take opportunity distribute provision ammunition feeling imagine active arrangement show heart smite head clear order march settle arrange wait return indian girl come last inform recover trail mile course stream start agree keep perfect silence follow discover trail mile arrival clear spot wood grass short dry fault go other side heath see fall half hour search discover summon low whistle return spot trail lose

38,"It was not till another half-hour had elapsed that the spot where they had left the trail, which, to deceive those who might pursue them, the Indians had returned upon, was discovered, and then they started again, and proceeded with caution, led by the Strawberry, until she stopped and spoke to Malachi in the Indian tongue, pointing at a small twig broken upon one of the bushes.",half hour elapse spot leave trail deceive pursue return discover start proceed caution lead stop speak indian tongue point small twig break bush

41,"""Then all's right,"" said Malachi, ""I said that she could help us again if she chose, and so she has. The Indian woman who wrote the letter,"" continued Malachi, turning to Captain Sinclair and Alfred, ""is our friend still.

Now, if she has continued to do this, we shall not have much trouble.""",right say say help choose have indian woman write letter continue turn friend see sir dare do see break small twig guide continue do have much trouble 
42,"They continued their course through the woods until the sun went down, and they could see no longer, having made a journey of about nine miles from the settlement. They then lay down for the night under a large tree; the weather was very warm, and they did not light a fire, as they had some cooked provisions.",continue course wood sun go see make journey mile settlement lay night large tree weather warm light fire have cook provision 
43,"The next morning, as soon as it was daylight, they made a hasty meal, and resumed their task. The trail was now pretty clear, and was occasionally verified by the breaking of a twig, as before. This day they made sixteen miles' journey, and at the close of it they arrived at the borders of a lake about ten miles long, and from one-and-a-half to two wide; the trail went right on to the shore of the lake, and then disappeared.",next morning daylight make hasty meal resume task trail clear verify breaking twig day make mile journey close arrive border lake mile long half wide trail go shore lake disappear

45,"""That we must discover, somehow or another, sir,"" replied Malachi, ""or else we shall not find the trail again; perhaps, however, we shall see to-morrow morning; it is too dark now to attempt to find out, and we may do more harm than good by tracking down the bank. We must bring to for the night. There is a high rock there on the beach further up, we had better go there, as we can light a fire behind the rock without being discovered by it, supposing the Indians are on the opposite shore; and to-night we must cook all our provisions if we possibly can, for, depend upon it, we have traveled faster to-day than they can have done with the young lady, and if we can once get well on the trail again, we shall soon be up with them.""",discover sir reply find trail see morning dark attempt find do more harm good track bank bring night be high rock beach have good go light fire rock discover suppose opposite shore night cook provision depend travel fast day do young lady get trail

48,"Captain Sinclair sighed, but made no reply.",sigh make reply 
49,"As soon as they arrived at the mass of rock which Malachi had pointed out, they all commenced collecting fire-wood, and the Strawberry in a few minutes had a sufficient fire for their purpose. They had not any cooking utensils with them, but the pork was cut in slices, and stuck upon the ends of small sticks round the fire, until it was sufficiently cooked, and then it was packed up again in parcels, with the exception of what was retained for their supper. They had finished their meal, and were sitting round the embers of the fire, conversing, and calculating the probabilities as to their overtaking the Indians, when Martin sprang up, with his rifle ready to bring to his shoulder.",arrive mass rock point commence collect fire wood few minute have sufficient fire purpose have cooking utensil pork cut slice stick end small stick fire cook pack parcel exception retain supper finish meal sit ember fire convers calculate probability overtake spring rifle ready bring shoulder

52,"As Martin said this, a low and singular sort of whistle between the teeth was heard, upon which the Strawberry gently put down Martin's rifle with her hand, saying,",say low singular sort whistle tooth hear put rifle hand say

64,"""No,"" replied John, with his mouth full.",reply mouth full 
65,"""Let him eat,"" said Malachi, ""it's long for a lad to be two days without food, for I'll answer he left as soon as he heard we were gone, and did not wait for yesterday's supper. Indeed he must have done so, for he must have followed the trail some time yesterday to be up with us to-night, so let him eat in quiet.""",let eat say long lad day food answer leave hear gone wait yesterday supper do follow trail time yesterday night let eat quiet 
66,"""What surprises me, Malachi, is how he could have found his way to us.""",surprise find way 
67,"""Well, sir, I do confess that I'm as much surprised almost as I am pleased,"" replied Malachi. ""It is really a great feat for a lad to accomplish all by himself, and I am proud of him for having done it; but from the first I saw what a capital woodsman he would make, and he has not disappointed me.""",sir confess surprised pleased reply great feat lad accomplish proud do first see capital woodsman make disappoint

69,"""But suppose he had not come up with us, how would he have lived in these woods? It's a mercy that he has fallen in with us,"" said Captain Sinclair.",suppose come live wood mercy fall say

73,"John having finished his supper, they all lay down to rest, one keeping watch that they might not be surprised.",finish supper lay rest keep watch surprise 
74,"At daylight they made their breakfast, and then went down again to the borders of the lake, where the trail had been lost. After a long examination, Malachi called the Strawberry, and pointing to the edge of the water, asked her to look there. The Strawberry did so, and at last decided that there was the mark of the bottom of a canoe which had been grounded.",daylight make breakfast go border lake trail lose long examination call point edge water ask look last decide be mark bottom canoe ground 
75,"""Yes, I thought so,"" said Malachi. ""They have had their canoe all ready, and have crossed the water; now, we must walk quite round the lake to discover the trail again, and that will give them half a day's start of us.""",think say have canoe ready cross water walk lake discover trail give day start 
76,"They immediately set off coasting the shore of the lake, until they arrived at the other side, carefully examining the ground as they went. This took them till noon, by which time they had arrived at that part of the lake which was opposite to the large rock behind which they had kindled their fire the night before; but no traces were to be perceived.",set coast shore lake arrive other side examine ground go take noon time arrive part lake opposite large rock kindle fire night trace perceive 
77,"""They have not crossed over in a straight line,"" said Captain Sinclair, ""that is evident; we must now try more to the northward.""",cross straight line say evident try more northward 
78,"This they did; and at last discovered that the canoe had crossed over to the north point of the lake, having coasted along the eastern shore the whole way. The spot of landing was very evident, and for some distance they could trace where the canoe had been hauled up. It was now late in the afternoon, and it became a question whether they should follow the trail, or discover the place of concealment of the canoe, as it might be advantageous to know where it was when they returned. It was decided that they should first discover the canoe, and this was not done till after a search of two hours, when they found it concealed in the bushes, about one mile from the lake. They then followed the trail about two miles; the twigs had been bent and broken, as before, which was a great help to them, but the night was now closing in. Having arrived at a clear knoll, they took up their quarters under the trees, and retired to rest. At daybreak they again started; and, after two hours' walk, had to track across a small prairie, which gave them some trouble, but they succeeded in finding the trail on their arrival at the wood on the opposite side, and then they made a very rapid progress, for the twigs were now more frequently broken and bent than before. During this day, with the bow and arrows brought by the Strawberry, Martin had procured them two wild turkeys, which were very acceptable, as their provisions would not last more than seven or eight days longer, and it was impossible to say how far they would have to travel. It was not far from dark when the quick ears of the Strawberry were attracted by a noise like that of a person breathing heavily. She at last pointed with her finger to a bush; they advanced cautiously, and on the other side of it they found an Indian woman lying on the ground, bleeding profusely. They raised her up, and discovered that it was the Indian whom they had cured of the sprained ankle, and who, they presumed, had been then discovered breaking the twigs that they might follow the trail, for, on examination they found that she had received a heavy blow on the head with a tomahawk; but, fortunately, it had glanced sidewise, and not entered into the brain. She was not sensible, however, at the time that they discovered her, for she had lost a great deal of blood. They stopped the effusion of blood with bandages torn from their linen, and poured some water down her throat; it was now dark, and it was not possible to proceed any further that night. The Strawberry went into the woods and collected some herbs, with which she dressed the wound, and having made the poor Indian as comfortable as they could, they again lay down to rest; but not until Malachi had said to Alfred--",last discover canoe cross north point lake coast eastern shore whole way spot landing evident distance trace canoe haul late afternoon become question follow trail discover place concealment canoe advantageous know return decide discover canoe do search hour find conceal bush mile lake follow trail mile twig bend break great help night close arrive clear knoll take quarter tree retire rest daybreak start hour walk have track small prairie give trouble succeed find trail arrival wood opposite side make rapid progress twig break bent day bow arrow bring procure wild turkey acceptable provision last more day impossible say have travel dark quick ear attract noise person breathe last point finger bush advance other side find indian woman lie ground bleed raise discover cure sprain ankle presume discover break twig follow trail examination find receive heavy blow head tomahawk glance enter brain sensible time discover lose great deal blood stop effusion blood bandage tear linen pour water throat dark possible proceed night go wood collect herb dress wound make poor indian comfortable lay rest say 
79,"""There is no doubt, sir, but that the Indians have discovered this woman was marking the trail for us, and that they have tomahawked her for so doing, and have left her for dead. I think myself that the wound, although it is a very ugly one, is not dangerous, and so says the Strawberry. However, to-morrow will decide the point; if she is not sensible then, it will be of no use waiting, but we must go on as fast as we can.""",be doubt sir discover woman mark trail tomahawk do leave dead think wound ugly one dangerous say decide point sensible use wait go 
80,"When they awoke the next morning they found the Strawberry sitting by the Indian woman, who was now quite sensible and collected, although very weak and exhausted. Malachi and Martin went to her, and had a long conversation with her at intervals. Malachi had been right in his supposition; the Angry Snake had discovered her in the act of bending a twig, and had struck her down with his tomahawk. They gained from her the following information. The Angry Snake, irritated at the detention of the Young Otter, and resolved to have another hostage in lieu of him, had carried off Mary Percival. He had six Indians with him, which were the whole of his grown-up warriors. They were now but one day's journey ahead of them, as Miss Percival was very sore on her feet, and they could not get her along, but that in every other respect she had been well treated. That the Indians were not going to their lodges in a direct course, but by a circuitous route, which would make a difference of at least six or seven days; and that they did this that they might not be seen by some other tribes who were located in their direct route, and who might give information. She said that it was she who had written the Indian letter which Malachi had received the autumn before, and that she had done it because she had been so kindly treated by Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, when she had been found in the forest with her ankle sprained. That Percival was at the Indian lodges, quite well when they left, and that if the Angry Snake did not receive a large quantity of powder and shot and a great many rifles in exchange for him, it was his intention to adopt the boy, as he was very partial to him. On being asked if the boy was happy, she replied that he was not at first, but now he was almost an Indian; that he was seldom permitted to leave the lodges, and never unless accompanied by the Angry Snake. In answer to their questions as to the direction and distance to the lodges, she said that they were about seven days' journey by the straight road; but that the party with Miss Percival would not arrive there in less than fifteen days, if so soon, as she was every day less able to travel. Having obtained all this information, a council was held, and Malachi spoke first, having been requested so to do.",awoke next morning find sit indian woman sensible collect weak exhausted go have long conversation interval right supposition angry discover act bending twig strike tomahawk gain follow information angry irritate detention young resolve have hostage lieu carry have whole grow warrior day journey sore foot get other respect treat go lodge direct course circuitous route make difference least day do see other tribe locate direct route give information say write indian letter receive autumn do treat find forest ankle sprain indian lodge leave angry receive large quantity powder shot great many rifle exchange intention adopt boy partial ask boy happy reply first indian permit leave lodge accompany angry answer question direction distance lodge say day journey straight road party arrive less day day able travel obtain information council hold speak request do 
81,"""My opinion is this,"" said Malachi, ""that we can do no better than remain here at present, and wait till the woman is sufficiently recovered to travel, and show us the direct road to the lodges. In two or three days she will probably be well enough to go with us, and then we will take the direct road, and be there before them. The knowledge of the place and the paths will enable us to lay an ambush for them, and to rescue the young lady without much danger to ourselves. They will have no idea of falling in with us, for they of course imagine the woman is dead; a tomahawk seldom fails.""",opinion say do good remain present wait woman recover travel show direct road lodge day enough go take direct road knowledge place path enable lay ambush rescue young lady much danger have idea fall course imagine woman dead tomahawk fail 
82,"After a long parley, the advice of Malachi was considered the most judicious, and a further conversation with the Indian woman confirmed them in their resolution. As they had no fear of the Indians discovering that they were on their trail, Martin and Alfred went out in pursuit of game for provisions, while the others raised up a large hut with branches of trees, for the accommodation of the whole party. In the evening Martin and Alfred returned, carrying a fine buck between them. The fire was lighted, and very soon all were busy cooking and eating. The Indian woman also begged for something to eat, and her recovery was now no longer considered doubtful.",long parley advice consider judicious further conversation indian woman confirm resolution have fear discover trail go pursuit game provision other raise large hut branch tree accommodation whole party evening return carry fine buck fire light busy cook eat indian woman begg eat recovery consider doubtful
