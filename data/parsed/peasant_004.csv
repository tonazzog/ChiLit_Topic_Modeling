2,"It was a comfort to Marie, on reaching home, to find that no soldiers were there.  The guests of the preceding night had been summoned to their duty, as the royal train might be certainly expected in the course of the morning.  The good-natured Jerome's heart had been touched by the lamentations of the boys for their lost favourites; and he had told them that, if they would leave off crying, so as to make their faces fit to be seen by the train of nobles, they might look out for him on the roadside, and he would try to place them where they might see the Dauphiness.  They had made every effort to look cheerful, and were thinking more about the Princess than of pigeons and rabbits when their sister returned; but when they witnessed her burst of weeping on her mother's bosom--when they heard that Charles was to be carried off for a soldier for three years, and that there was to be no hut in the wood, and no new brother-in-law for them, they cried more bitterly than ever.",comfort reach find soldier guest preced night summon duty royal train expect course morning good natured heart touch lamentation boy lose favourite tell leave cry make face fit see train noble look roadside try place see make effort look cheerful think more pigeon rabbit sister return witness burst weeping mother bosom hear carry soldier year be be hut wood new brother law cry 
3,"In the midst of this scene, Jerome came by on horseback.  He could not stop; but he called out that the band had been heard already, and pointed to the place where the boys should go and take their stand. They did not now care anything about the procession, or the coach with six horses, or the handsome ladies, or the noble gentlemen that Jerome had promised they should see.  Their mother wished that they should not miss such a sight: but they did not move as she said so.  When, however, Marie turned her face towards them, and said, ""Go, dears: pray do,"" they took their caps, and walked away; they thought it so kind of Marie to care for their pleasure at such a time.",midst scene come horseback stop call band hear point place boy go take stand care procession coach horse handsome lady noble gentleman promise see mother wish miss sight move say turn face say go dear pray do take cap walk think kind care pleasure time 
4,"Jerome passed again, after they had gone a few yards, and nodded and beckoned.  They ran and kept up with his horse, till he stopped opposite the post-house.  He told them hastily that he was to be stationed here; and he was glad of it, as it was expected that the party would halt at the post-house.  He desired the boys to keep close behind, at his horse's tail, where nobody would meddle with them.  They must not notice him till spoken to, and must take care of his horse's tread: all the rest they might leave to him.  There was presently an opportunity for him to speak a few words more to them; and he could not help saying how sorry he was to see how they had been crying since he had left their cottage.  Of course, this brought out the story of Charles, and the new misfortune threatened to the family.  Jerome was not the only one who heard the tale.  His smoking comrade was by his side: and it was exactly the kind of story to which his ears were most open.  The two soldiers conversed together in a low voice for a minute or two, and then sat bolt upright and silent, as if they had been made of stone, and had not each carried a pitying heart under his stiff uniform and steady countenance. When the military music was heard coming nearer and nearer, and distant cheers were borne on the breeze, the commanding officer rode by, and saw nothing in the demeanour of these two soldiers to distinguish them from all the rest of the line, who were thinking only of themselves or the Dauphiness.",pass go few yard nod beckon run keep horse stop post house tell station glad expect party halt post house desire boy keep horse tail meddle notice speak take care horse tread rest leave be opportunity speak few word more help say sorry see cry leave cottage course bring story new misfortune threaten family only one hear tale smoking comrade side kind story ear open soldier convers low voice minute sit bolt upright silent make stone carry pity heart stiff uniform steady countenance military music hear come distant cheer borne breeze commanding officer ride see demeanour soldier distinguish rest line think 
5,"She came, preceded by so many attendants on horseback, and inferior carriages, which passed without taking any notice of the post-house, that Robin and Marc heard the people about them lamenting that there would be no halt, and that they should barely see the Princess after all.  They were mistaken, however.  It was one of the plans of the journey that the royal carriage should stop for a few moments at every post-house, whether fresh horses were wanted or not, in order that the loyal feeling of the people should be cherished by a sight of her who was to be their queen, and whose appearance was indeed likely to captivate all eyes and hearts.",come precede many attendant horseback inferior carriage pass take notice post house hear person lament be halt see mistaken plan journey royal carriage stop few moment post house fresh horse want order loyal feeling person cherish sight queen appearance likely captivate eye heart 
6,"The six bay horses were checked precisely at the right spot: and all which preceded the royal carriage halted at the same moment.  The air was rent by a cheer, such a cheer as convinced the Count and his family how faint in comparison their welcome had been, when they had appeared from the by-road to the chateau half an hour before.  When his train had taken their station at the entrance of Saint Menehould, there had been a few cries of ""Long live the Count our lord!"" but they were a mere whisper compared with the acclamation which greeted the Dauphiness.",horse check right spot precede royal carriage halt same moment air rent cheer cheer convince family faint comparison welcome appear road chateau hour train take station entrance be few cry long live count lord mere whisper compare acclamation greet 
7,"The royal carriage was open almost all round, so that the Princess was conspicuously visible.  She was full as beautiful as any of the gazers had expected.  Her complexion was fresh and fair, her countenance smiling, and her blue eyes full of spirit and feeling; and though she looked no more than fifteen (her actual age), all thought, as she moved her stately head in answer to their greeting, that they had never seen so dignified a lady.",royal carriage open visible full beautiful gazer expect complexion fresh fair countenance smile blue eye full spirit feeling look more actual age think move stately head answer greeting see dignified lady 
8,"In about two minutes from the halting of her carriage, Jerome turned his head round with a hasty smile to the boys; and before they knew what it meant, his and his comrade's horses began scrambling and sliding. Jerome's opened a way for the boys to escape into the road from the danger of a kick; and as soon as they were safe there, the horses began to prance, and make yet more confusion.  The Dauphiness looked that way, as Jerome intended that she should; and when her attention was fairly fixed, he called to the boys to come back to their places.",minute halting carriage turn head hasty smile boy know mean comrade horse begin scramble slide open way boy escape road danger kick safe horse begin prance make more confusion look way intend attention fix call boy come place 
9,"As Jerome had hoped, their doleful faces, all swollen with crying, attracted the notice of the Princess, who had hitherto met only smiling countenances wherever she turned, since she had entered her new country. These traces of tears carried back her thoughts to her own weeping, some days before, on leaving Vienna; and she suddenly beckoned to the children.  In a moment a hundred voices bade them go forward to the carriage; a hundred hands pointed and pushed, so that they were presently within hearing of the kind questions of the young Princess.",hope doleful face swollen cry attract notice meet smile countenance turn enter new country trace tear carry thought own weeping day leave beckon child moment voice bid go carriage hand point push hearing kind question young 
10,"She asked what made them so unhappy on this day, when every one else looked pleased and joyful.  They could scarcely help crying again at the question; but they were old enough to know that everything might depend on their behaviour at this moment; and they strove to speak, and to speak plainly.  Had they been ill?  The Princess asked, observing to her ladies that they looked sadly thin.  No, they had not been ill, they replied; they were only very unhappy to-day.",ask make unhappy day one else look pleased joyful help cry question old know depend behaviour moment strive speak speak ill ask observe lady look thin ill reply unhappy day 
11,"The bailiff, who was in attendance on the Count's family, now put himself forward to explain, not to the Dauphiness herself (that would have been too bold), but to one of her ladies, on the other side of the carriage, about his having taken away the boys' rabbits and pigeons according to law.",bailiff attendance family put explain bold lady other side carriage take boy rabbit pigeon accord law 
12,"""'Tis not that,"" cried Marc, indignantly, as he heard this.  ""We left off crying about the rabbits and pigeons long ago: did not we, Robin? It is about Charles and Marie.""",cry hear leave cry rabbit pigeon 
13,"""Tell me about Charles and Marie,"" said the Princess, in broken French, ""and then all about your pigeons.""",tell say break french pigeon 
14,"""Charles and our sister were just going to be married, and we had begun a house in the wood for them; and we have had to pull it to pieces again; and this morning the Count says Charles must go for a soldier for three years; and Marie is crying at home so--""",sister go marry begin house wood have pull piece morning count say go soldier year cry home 
15,Marc could not go on for his own tears.,go own tear 
16,"The Count's sons had, by this time, made their way through the closing crowd, to hear what was going on.",son time make way close crowd hear go 
17,"""Casimir,"" said his brother, ""your bad work of this morning must be undone, you see.  Do your part with a good grace.  Bring my father to receive the commands of the Dauphiness.""",say brother bad work morning undone see do part good grace bring father receive command 
18,"Casimir yielded.  While he was gone, his brother explained to the Princess the rights which the Count had over this family, as over the other peasants of the neighbourhood.  He ventured to answer for his father, that he would see the hardship of this particular case, and would permit some arrangement to be made, by which Charles might be spared the threatened misfortune, and restored to his hopes of a speedy marriage.",yield gone brother explain right have family other peasant neighbourhood venture answer father see hardship particular case permit arrangement make spare threaten misfortune restore hope speedy marriage 
19,"""Where is this Charles?"" asked the Princess.  ""I will not ask to see the tearful Marie before so many eyes.""",ask ask see tearful many eye 
20,"Robin had seen Charles, just before, near the spot; for Charles was desperate, and would neither hide nor attempt to escape.  He roamed about, half-mad with the suffering of his mind, among the holiday groups of Saint Menehould; and when called, was not long in presenting himself.",see spot desperate hide attempt escape roam half mad suffering mind holiday group call long present 
21,"""Alas!  Is this the bridegroom?"" asked the Princess, shrugging her shoulders, with an expression of pity.",bridegroom ask shrugg shoulder expression pity 
22,"""He looks better than that sometimes, when he plays with us,"" said Marc, zealous for his friend Charles.",look good play say zealous friend 
23,"""But his dress!"" said a lady, who had seldom before seen a peasant, and was not familiarised with the coarse woollen garment and leathern belt, so common among the country people.",dress say lady see peasant familiarise coarse woollen garment leathern belt common country person 
24,"""It is just what father wears, and everybody,"" maintained Marc.",father wear maintain 
25,"By this time the Count was waiting the pleasure of the Princess, ready to assure her of his patronage of any persons she might please to favour.  The Dauphiness asked whether such poverty as she witnessed was not a thing hitherto unheard of,--whether such misery could be common in the country she had just entered?  The bridling of some of her ladies, and the annoyance in the faces of some gentlemen of her suite, showed her that she had asked an imprudent question.  Yet she was only fifteen, and was to be hereafter the queen of this country; and if she had never done worse things than asking such questions, she might have lived beloved, and died lamented, in a good old age.",time wait pleasure ready assure patronage person please favour ask such poverty witness thing unheard such misery common country enter bridling lady annoyance face gentleman suite show ask imprudent question queen country do bad thing ask such question live beloved die lament good old age 
26,"She saw another thing in the countenances of her attendants,--that it was time to be gone.  She therefore requested of the Count, as a favour to herself, that he would settle Charles advantageously on his lands; and smiling at the young man, she declared that she would answer for Charles's fidelity to his lord.  Charles was on his knees at the word, too much overpowered to speak, but promising all by his clasped hands and heaving breast.  The Count declared he should have a cottage and a field that very day, and his hearty consent to take Marie home as soon as the priest could marry them.",see thing countenance attendant time gone request favour settle land smile young man declare answer fidelity lord knee word overpower speak promise clasp hand heave breast declare have cottage field day hearty consent take home priest marry 
27,"The Dauphiness asked one of her attendant gentlemen for her purse, and gave the boys gold for Marie.  They were to tell her to make her cottage comfortable with it.",ask attendant gentleman purse give boy gold tell make cottage comfortable 
28,"""As for yourselves,"" said she, ""what did I hear just now that you wanted?  Canary-birds, was it?""",say hear want canary bird 
29,"""Pigeons,""--""rabbits,"" said the boys; ""but never mind them now.""",pigeon rabbit say boy mind 
30,"""O, but I do mind; you shall have some money for that too.""",mind have money 
31,"The bailiff explained that it was not poverty, but the law which interfered with the boys' pleasures.  Pigeons abounded in the wood, and could feed themselves; but it was against the law for any under the rank of a noble to keep them.  The Dauphiness supposed this was all as it should be; for she was apt, through life, to believe that the nobles were by nature entitled to all things, and might give only such leavings as they did not wish for, to inferior people: yet she was pleased, and repaid the bailiff with a gracious smile, when he said that all laws melted away before the wishes of a royal bride, and that these peasant boys should have their rabbit-hutch and dove-cot henceforth, by special permission.",bailiff explain poverty law interfer boy pleasure pigeon abound wood feed law rank noble keep suppose apt life believe noble nature entitle thing give such leaving wish inferior person pleased repaid bailiff gracious smile say law melt wish royal bride peasant boy have rabbit hutch dove cot henceforth special permission 
32,"None waved their caps more vehemently, none shouted ""Long live the Dauphiness!"" more vigorously, as the cavalcade set forth again, than Robin and Marc.  When the last horseman vanished in the dust of the road, the attention of the crowd turned upon the favoured family of Randolphe.  The poor man himself had retired overpowered, and no one could tell where he was.  Charles was with Marie already.  But the boys remained in the road; they were hoisted on the shoulders of their neighbours, having first delivered the precious gold pieces into the hands of the curd, lest they should lose Marie's treasure in the bustle. Robin would not be carried a step towards home till he had been allowed to speak to Jerome.  He threw his arms round the neck of the good-natured soldier, and said that it was he who had made Marie's fortune.  Then Jerome had to shake hands with every person in the crowd; and every man who had a house or cottage begged Jerome to be his guest. Jerome laughed, and said, that among so many he should not have known what to reply, and how to choose his host; but that he and his comrades were at Saint Menehould only for the occasion which was now passed, and before night they would be twenty miles off.",wave cap shout live cavalcade set last horseman vanish dust road attention crowd turn favour family poor man retire overpower tell boy remain road hoist shoulder neighbour deliver precious gold piece hand curd lose treasure bustle carry step home allow speak throw arm neck good natured soldier say make fortune have shake hand person crowd man have house cottage begg guest laugh say many know reply choose host comrade occasion pass night mile 
33,"Before sunset, accordingly, Jerome and the smoker were riding side by side on the road to fresh quarters, each with a fine bouquet of spring flowers at his breast, sent by Marie.  They were talking of the events of the morning, of the sudden rescue of a worthy family from the depths of misery.  The smoker could not be cheered even by what he had witnessed; and he spoke as gloomily and sententiously as if the pipe were now between his lips, and his words coming forth in a cloud of smoke.  Jerome could not but own, however, that there was much truth in what he said, when he declared, ""It is all very well, and I am glad this one family is saved.  But it is only one of many hundred thousand miserable families.  What is to become of all the rest, who may not have the luck to see a royal bride pass their way?  It is not a few royal smiles and gold pieces, here and there, that will save the royal, or the noble, or the poor, while the law and the customs of the great oppress and destroy a hundred to pamper one.  If this young Dauphiness were to do this deed over again every hour of the year, she could not do more than put off for a little while the storm that will burst upon her and all of us, when the poor can endure no more.""",sunset smoker ride side side road fresh quarter fine bouquet spring flower breast send talk event morning sudden rescue worthy family depth misery smoker cheer witness speak pipe lip word come cloud smoke own be much truth say declare glad family save many miserable family become rest have luck see royal bride pass way few royal smile gold piece save royal noble poor law custom great oppress destroy pamper young do deed hour year do more put little storm burst poor endure more
