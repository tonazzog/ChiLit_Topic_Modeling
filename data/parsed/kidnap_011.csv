1,CHAPTER X. THE SIEGE OF THE ROUND-HOUSE,chapter siege round 
2,"But now our time of truce was come to an end. Those on deck had waited for my coming till they grew impatient; and scarce had Alan spoken, when the captain showed face in the open door.",time truce come end deck wait come grow impatient scarce speak captain show face open door 
3,"“Stand!” cried Alan, and pointed his sword at him. The captain stood, indeed; but he neither winced nor drew back a foot.",stand cry point sword captain stand wince draw foot 
4,“A naked sword?” says he. “This is a strange return for hospitality.”,naked sword say strange return hospitality 
5,"“Do ye see me?” said Alan. “I am come of kings; I bear a king’s name. My badge is the oak. Do ye see my sword? It has slashed the heads off mair Whigamores than you have toes upon your feet. Call up your vermin to your back, sir, and fall on! The sooner the clash begins, the sooner ye’ll taste this steel throughout your vitals.”",see say come king bear king name badge oak see sword slash head mair have toe foot call vermin back sir fall clash begin taste steel vital 
6,"The captain said nothing to Alan, but he looked over at me with an ugly look. “David,” said he, “I’ll mind this;” and the sound of his voice went through me with a jar.",captain say look ugly look say mind sound voice go jar 
7,Next moment he was gone.,next moment gone 
8,"“And now,” said Alan, “let your hand keep your head, for the grip is coming.”",say let hand keep head grip come 
9,"Alan drew a dirk, which he held in his left hand in case they should run in under his sword. I, on my part, clambered up into the berth with an armful of pistols and something of a heavy heart, and set open the window where I was to watch. It was a small part of the deck that I could overlook, but enough for our purpose. The sea had gone down, and the wind was steady and kept the sails quiet; so that there was a great stillness in the ship, in which I made sure I heard the sound of muttering voices. A little after, and there came a clash of steel upon the deck, by which I knew they were dealing out the cutlasses and one had been let fall; and after that, silence again.",draw dirk hold left hand case run sword part clamber berth armful pistol heavy heart set open window watch small part deck overlook purpose sea go wind steady keep sail quiet be great stillness ship make sure hear sound mutter voice little come clash steel deck know deal cutlass let fall silence 
10,"I do not know if I was what you call afraid; but my heart beat like a bird’s, both quick and little; and there was a dimness came before my eyes which I continually rubbed away, and which continually returned. As for hope, I had none; but only a darkness of despair and a sort of anger against all the world that made me long to sell my life as dear as I was able. I tried to pray, I remember, but that same hurry of my mind, like a man running, would not suffer me to think upon the words; and my chief wish was to have the thing begin and be done with it.",know call afraid heart beat bird quick little be dimness come eye rub return hope have darkness despair sort anger world make sell life dear able try pray remember same hurry mind man run suffer think word chief wish have thing begin do 
11,"It came all of a sudden when it did, with a rush of feet and a roar, and then a shout from Alan, and a sound of blows and some one crying out as if hurt. I looked back over my shoulder, and saw Mr. Shuan in the doorway, crossing blades with Alan.",come sudden rush foot roar shout sound blow one cry hurt look shoulder see doorway cross blade 
12,“That’s him that killed the boy!” I cried.,kill boy cry 
13,"“Look to your window!” said Alan; and as I turned back to my place, I saw him pass his sword through the mate’s body.",look window say turn place see pass sword mate body 
14,"It was none too soon for me to look to my own part; for my head was scarce back at the window, before five men, carrying a spare yard for a battering-ram, ran past me and took post to drive the door in. I had never fired with a pistol in my life, and not often with a gun; far less against a fellow-creature. But it was now or never; and just as they swang the yard, I cried out: “Take that!” and shot into their midst.",look own part head scarce window man carry spare yard battering ram run take post drive door fire pistol life gun less fellow creature swang yard cry take shoot midst 
15,"I must have hit one of them, for he sang out and gave back a step, and the rest stopped as if a little disconcerted. Before they had time to recover, I sent another ball over their heads; and at my third shot (which went as wide as the second) the whole party threw down the yard and ran for it.",hit sing give step rest stop little disconcert have time recover send ball head third shot go wide second whole party throw yard run 
16,"Then I looked round again into the deck-house. The whole place was full of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with the noise of the shots. But there was Alan, standing as before; only now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking slowly lower, with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it.",look deck house whole place full smoke own fire ear seem burst noise shot be stand sword run blood hilt swell triumph fall fine attitude look invincible floor hand knee blood pour mouth sink low terrible white face look catch hold heel drag round house believe die do 
17,"“There’s one of your Whigs for ye!” cried Alan; and then turning to me, he asked if I had done much execution.",be cry turn ask do much execution 
18,"I told him I had winged one, and thought it was the captain.",tell wing think captain 
19,"“And I’ve settled two,” says he. “No, there’s not enough blood let; they’ll be back again. To your watch, David. This was but a dram before meat.”",settle say be enough blood let watch dram meat 
20,"I settled back to my place, re-charging the three pistols I had fired, and keeping watch with both eye and ear.",settle place re-charg pistol fire keep watch eye ear 
21,"Our enemies were disputing not far off upon the deck, and that so loudly that I could hear a word or two above the washing of the seas.",enemy dispute deck hear word washing sea 
22,"“It was Shuan bauchled* it,” I heard one say.",bauchle hear say 
23,     * Bungled.,bungle 
24,"And another answered him with a “Wheesht, man! He’s paid the piper.”",answer man pay piper 
25,"After that the voices fell again into the same muttering as before. Only now, one person spoke most of the time, as though laying down a plan, and first one and then another answered him briefly, like men taking orders. By this, I made sure they were coming on again, and told Alan.",voice fall same muttering person speak most time lay plan first answer man take order make sure come tell 
26,"“It’s what we have to pray for,” said he. “Unless we can give them a good distaste of us, and done with it, there’ll be nae sleep for either you or me. But this time, mind, they’ll be in earnest.”",have pray say give good distaste do nae sleep time mind earnest 
27,"By this, my pistols were ready, and there was nothing to do but listen and wait. While the brush lasted, I had not the time to think if I was frighted; but now, when all was still again, my mind ran upon nothing else. The thought of the sharp swords and the cold steel was strong in me; and presently, when I began to hear stealthy steps and a brushing of men’s clothes against the round-house wall, and knew they were taking their places in the dark, I could have found it in my mind to cry out aloud.",pistol ready be do listen wait brush last have time think frighted mind run else thought sharp sword cold steel strong begin hear stealthy step brushing man clothes round house wall know take place dark find mind cry 
28,"All this was upon Alan’s side; and I had begun to think my share of the fight was at an end, when I heard some one drop softly on the roof above me.",side begin think share fight end hear drop roof 
29,"Then there came a single call on the sea-pipe, and that was the signal. A knot of them made one rush of it, cutlass in hand, against the door; and at the same moment, the glass of the skylight was dashed in a thousand pieces, and a man leaped through and landed on the floor. Before he got his feet, I had clapped a pistol to his back, and might have shot him, too; only at the touch of him (and him alive) my whole flesh misgave me, and I could no more pull the trigger than I could have flown.",come single call sea pipe signal knot make rush cutlass hand door same moment glass skylight dash piece man leap land floor get foot clapp pistol back shoot touch alive whole flesh misgave pull trigger fly 
30,"He had dropped his cutlass as he jumped, and when he felt the pistol, whipped straight round and laid hold of me, roaring out an oath; and at that either my courage came again, or I grew so much afraid as came to the same thing; for I gave a shriek and shot him in the midst of the body. He gave the most horrible, ugly groan and fell to the floor. The foot of a second fellow, whose legs were dangling through the skylight, struck me at the same time upon the head; and at that I snatched another pistol and shot this one through the thigh, so that he slipped through and tumbled in a lump on his companion’s body. There was no talk of missing, any more than there was time to aim; I clapped the muzzle to the very place and fired.",drop cutlass jump feel pistol whip lay hold roar oath courage come grow afraid come same thing give shriek shoot midst body give horrible ugly groan fall floor foot second fellow leg dangle skylight strike same time head snatch pistol shoot one thigh slip tumble lump companion body be talk miss more be time aim clapp muzzle very place fire 
31,"I might have stood and stared at them for long, but I heard Alan shout as if for help, and that brought me to my senses.",stand stare hear shout help bring sense 
32,"He had kept the door so long; but one of the seamen, while he was engaged with others, had run in under his guard and caught him about the body. Alan was dirking him with his left hand, but the fellow clung like a leech. Another had broken in and had his cutlass raised. The door was thronged with their faces. I thought we were lost, and catching up my cutlass, fell on them in flank.",keep door seamen engage other run guard catch body dirk left hand fellow cling leech break have cutlass raise door throng face think lose catching cutlass fall flank 
33,"But I had not time to be of help. The wrestler dropped at last; and Alan, leaping back to get his distance, ran upon the others like a bull, roaring as he went. They broke before him like water, turning, and running, and falling one against another in their haste. The sword in his hands flashed like quicksilver into the huddle of our fleeing enemies; and at every flash there came the scream of a man hurt. I was still thinking we were lost, when lo! they were all gone, and Alan was driving them along the deck as a sheep-dog chases sheep.",have time help wrestler drop last leap get distance run other bull roar go break water turn run fall haste sword hand flash quicksilver huddle flee enemy flash come scream man hurt think lose gone drive deck sheep dog chase sheep 
34,"Yet he was no sooner out than he was back again, being as cautious as he was brave; and meanwhile the seamen continued running and crying out as if he was still behind them; and we heard them tumble one upon another into the forecastle, and clap-to the hatch upon the top.",cautious brave seamen continue run cry hear tumble forecastle clap hatch top 
35,"The round-house was like a shambles; three were dead inside, another lay in his death agony across the threshold; and there were Alan and I victorious and unhurt.",round house shamble dead lay death agony threshold be victorious unhurt 
36,"He came up to me with open arms. “Come to my arms!” he cried, and embraced and kissed me hard upon both cheeks. “David,” said he, “I love you like a brother. And O, man,” he cried in a kind of ecstasy, “am I no a bonny fighter?”",come open arm come arm cry embrace kiss cheek say love brother cry kind ecstasy bonny fighter 
37,"Thereupon he turned to the four enemies, passed his sword clean through each of them, and tumbled them out of doors one after the other. As he did so, he kept humming and singing and whistling to himself, like a man trying to recall an air; only what HE was trying was to make one. All the while, the flush was in his face, and his eyes were as bright as a five-year-old child’s with a new toy. And presently he sat down upon the table, sword in hand; the air that he was making all the time began to run a little clearer, and then clearer still; and then out he burst with a great voice into a Gaelic song.",turn enemy pass sword clean tumble door other do keep hum sing whistle man try recall air try make while flush face eye bright year old child new toy sit table sword hand air make time begin run little clear clear burst great voice gaelic song 
38,"I have translated it here, not in verse (of which I have no skill) but at least in the king’s English.",translate verse have skill least king 
39,"He sang it often afterwards, and the thing became popular; so that I have heard it and had it explained to me, many’s the time.",sing thing become popular hear have explain many time 
40," “This is the song of the sword of Alan; The smith made it, The fire set it; Now it shines in the hand of Alan Breck.",song sword smith make fire set shine hand 
41,"“Their eyes were many and bright, Swift were they to behold, Many the hands they guided: The sword was alone.",eye many bright behold many hand guide sword alone 
42,"“The dun deer troop over the hill, They are many, the hill is one; The dun deer vanish, The hill remains.",dun deer troop hill many hill dun deer vanish hill remain 
43,"“Come to me from the hills of heather, Come from the isles of the sea. O far-beholding eagles, Here is your meat.”",come hill heather come isle sea behold eagle meat 
44," Now this song which he made (both words and music) in the hour of our victory, is something less than just to me, who stood beside him in the tussle. Mr. Shuan and five more were either killed outright or thoroughly disabled; but of these, two fell by my hand, the two that came by the skylight. Four more were hurt, and of that number, one (and he not the least important) got his hurt from me. So that, altogether, I did my fair share both of the killing and the wounding, and might have claimed a place in Alan’s verses. But poets have to think upon their rhymes; and in good prose talk, Alan always did me more than justice.",song make word music hour victory less stand tussle more kill outright disabled fall hand come skylight more hurt number least important get hurt do fair share killing wound claim place verse poet have think rhyme good prose talk do more justice 
45,"In the meanwhile, I was innocent of any wrong being done me. For not only I knew no word of the Gaelic; but what with the long suspense of the waiting, and the scurry and strain of our two spirts of fighting, and more than all, the horror I had of some of my own share in it, the thing was no sooner over than I was glad to stagger to a seat. There was that tightness on my chest that I could hardly breathe; the thought of the two men I had shot sat upon me like a nightmare; and all upon a sudden, and before I had a guess of what was coming, I began to sob and cry like any child.",meanwhile innocent wrong do know word long suspense waiting scurry strain spirt fighting more horror have own share thing glad stagger seat be tightness chest breathe thought man shoot sit nightmare sudden have guess come begin sob cry child 
46,"Alan clapped my shoulder, and said I was a brave lad and wanted nothing but a sleep.",clapp shoulder say brave lad want sleep 
47,"“I’ll take the first watch,” said he. “Ye’ve done well by me, David, first and last; and I wouldn’t lose you for all Appin--no, nor for Breadalbane.”",take first watch say do first last lose 
48,"So I made up my bed on the floor; and he took the first spell, pistol in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain’s watch upon the wall. Then he roused me up, and I took my turn of three hours; before the end of which it was broad day, and a very quiet morning, with a smooth, rolling sea that tossed the ship and made the blood run to and fro on the round-house floor, and a heavy rain that drummed upon the roof. All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the helm, I knew they had even no one at the tiller. Indeed (as I learned afterwards) there were so many of them hurt or dead, and the rest in so ill a temper, that Mr. Riach and the captain had to take turn and turn like Alan and me, or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the wiser. It was a mercy the night had fallen so still, for the wind had gone down as soon as the rain began. Even as it was, I judged by the wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round the ship, that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of the islands of the Hebrides; and at last, looking out of the door of the round-house, I saw the great stone hills of Skye on the right hand, and, a little more astern, the strange isle of Rum.",make bed floor take first spell pistol hand sword knee hour captain watch wall rouse take turn hour end broad day quiet morning smooth rolling sea toss ship make blood run for round house floor heavy rain drumm roof watch be stir bang helm know have tiller learn be many hurt dead rest ill temper captain have take turn turn brig go wise mercy night fall wind go rain begin judge wail great number gull go cry fishing ship drift coast island last look door round house see great stone hill right hand little astern strange isle
