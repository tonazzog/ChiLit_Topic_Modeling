1,CHAPTER V. _What Prince Prigio found in the garret._,find garret 
2,"THE prince walked from room to room of the palace; but, unless he wrapped himself up in a curtain, there was nothing for him to wear when he went out in the rain. At last he climbed up a turret-stair in the very oldest part of the castle, where he had never been before; and at the very top was a little round room, a kind of garret. The prince pushed in the door with some difficulty--not that it was locked, but the handle was rusty, and the wood had swollen with the damp. The room was very dark; only the last grey light of the rainy evening came through a slit of a window, one of those narrow windows that they used to fire arrows out of in old times.",prince walk room room palace wrap curtain be wear go rain last climb turret stair old part castle very top little round room kind garret prince push door difficulty lock handle rusty wood swollen damp room dark last grey light rainy evening come slit window narrow window use fire arrow old time 
3,"But in the dusk the prince saw a heap of all sorts of things lying on the floor and on the table. There were two caps; he put one on--an old, grey, ugly cap it was, made of felt. There was a pair of boots; and he kicked off his slippers, and got into _them_. They were a good deal worn, but fitted as if they had been made for him. On the table was a purse with just three gold coins--old ones, too--in it; and this, as you may fancy, the prince was very well pleased to put in his pocket. A sword, with a sword-belt, he buckled about his waist; and the rest of the articles, a regular collection of odds and ends, he left just where they were lying. Then he ran downstairs, and walked out of the hall door.",dusk prince see heap sort thing lie floor table be cap put old grey ugly cap make feel be pair boot kick slipper get good deal wear fit make table purse gold coin old one fancy prince pleased put pocket sword sword belt buckle waist rest article regular collection odd end leave lie run walk hall door
