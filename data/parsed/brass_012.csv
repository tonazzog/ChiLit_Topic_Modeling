2," Jessie, the neat and pretty parlour-maid, opened the door with a smile of welcome which Horace found reassuring. No girl, he thought, whose master had suddenly been transformed into a mule could possibly smile like that. The Professor, she told him, was not at home, which again was comforting. For a _savant_, however careless about his personal appearance, would scarcely venture to brave public opinion in the semblance of a quadruped.",neat pretty parlour maid open door smile welcome find reassure girl think master transform mule smile tell home comforting _savant_ careless personal appearance venture brave public opinion semblance quadruped

8,"He had not been in the drawing-room long before Mrs. Futvoye appeared, and one glance at her face confirmed Ventimore's worst fears. Outwardly she was calm enough, but it was only too obvious that her calmness was the result of severe self-repression; her eyes, usually so shrewdly and placidly observant, had a haggard and hunted look; her ears seemed on the strain to catch some distant sound.",draw room appear glance face confirm bad fear calm obvious calmness result severe self repression eye observant have haggard hunt look ear seem strain catch distant sound

22,"""Mother,"" she cried, without seeing Horace in her agitation, ""do come to papa, quick! He has just begun kicking again, and I can't manage him alone....

But I had better go and see if your father wants anything."" And she hurried out of the room.",tell dear reply mother know possible add warning glance daughter know make mystery mere attack gout have good go see father want hurry room

39,"""I wasn't proposing to try to make him see the humorous side of his situation,"" Horace mildly explained. ""I trust I have more tact than that. But he may be glad to know that, at the worst, it is only a temporary inconvenience. I'll take care that he's all right again before very long.""",propose try make see humorous side situation explain trust have more tact glad know bad temporary inconvenience take care right

43,"""No,"" she replied. ""I was only told of it afterwards. Mother heard papa talking loudly in his study this morning, as if he was angry with somebody, and at last she grew so uneasy she couldn't bear it any longer, and went in to see what was the matter with him. Dad was quite alone and looked as usual, only a little excited; and then, without the slightest warning, just as she entered the room, he--he changed slowly into a mule before her eyes!

47,"""I don't know,"" she said slowly. ""Several things last night.

You pretended you were quite poor.""",know say several thing last night nice else live such queer room dine cushion dreadful black slave dancing girl thing pretend poor

54,"""But, of course, I never really thought it would be so awful as this!"" she said. ""Horace, how _could_ you be so careless as to let a great wicked thing like that escape out of its bottle?""",course think awful say careless let great wicked thing escape bottle 
55,"""I had a notion it was a manuscript,"" said Horace--""till he came out. But he isn't a great wicked thing, Sylvia. He's an amiable old Jinnee enough. And he'd do anything for me. Nobody could be more grateful and generous than he has been.""",have notion manuscript say come great wicked thing amiable old do grateful generous 
56,"""Do you call it generous to change the poor, dear dad into a mule?"" inquired Sylvia, with a little curl of her upper lip.",call generous change poor dear dad mule inquire little curl upper lip 
57,"""That was an oversight,"" said Horace; ""he meant no harm by it. In Arabia they do these things--or used to in his day. Not that that's much excuse for him. Still, he's not so young as he was, and besides, being bottled up for all those centuries must have narrowed him rather. You must try and make allowances for him, darling.""",oversight say mean harm do thing use day much excuse young bottled century narrow try make allowance darling 
58,"""I shan't,"" said Sylvia, ""unless he apologises to poor father, and puts him right at once.""",say apologise poor father put 
59,"""Why, of course, he'll do that,"" Horace answered confidently. ""I'll see that he does. I don't mean to stand any more of his nonsense. I'm afraid I've been just a little too slack for fear of hurting his feelings; but this time he's gone too far, and I shall talk to him like a Dutch uncle. He's always ready to do the right thing when he's once shown where he has gone wrong--only he takes such a lot of showing, poor old chap!""",course do answer see mean stand more nonsense afraid little slack fear hurt feeling time go talk dutch uncle ready do right thing show go wrong take lot show poor old chap

65,"""Oh yes, he will. He can do the whole trip, _aller et retour_, you know, in a few hours. He's an active old beggar for his age. In the meantime, dearest, the chief thing is to keep up your father's spirits. So I think I'd better---- I was just telling Sylvia, Mrs. Futvoye,"" he said, as that lady re-entered the room, ""that I should like to see the Professor at once.""",do whole trip know few hour active old beggar age meantime dearest chief thing keep father spirit think good tell say lady re-enter room like see

70,"Privately, though naturally he could not say so, Horace thought a vet. might be more appropriate, but eventually he persuaded Mrs. Futvoye to conduct him to her husband's study.",say think vet appropriate persuade conduct husband study 
71,"""Anthony, love,"" she said, as she knocked gently at the door, ""I've brought Horace Ventimore to see you for a few moments, if he may.""",love say knock door bring see few moment 
72,"It seemed from the sounds of furious snorting and stamping within, that the Professor resented this intrusion on his privacy. ""My dear Anthony,"" said his devoted wife, as she unlocked the door and turned the key on the inside after admitting Horace, ""try to be calm. Think of the servants downstairs. Horace is _so_ anxious to help.""",seem sound furious snorting stamp resent intrusion privacy dear say devoted wife unlock door turn key inside admit try calm think servant anxious help 
73,"As for Ventimore, he was speechless--so inexpressibly shocked was he by the alteration in the Professor's appearance. He had never seen a mule in sorrier condition or in so vicious a temper. Most of the lighter furniture had been already reduced to matchwood; the glass doors of the bookcase were starred or shivered; precious Egyptian pottery and glass were strewn in fragments on the carpets, and even the mummy, though it still smiled with the same enigmatic cheerfulness, seemed to have suffered severely from the Professorial hoofs.",speechless shocked alteration appearance see mule sorrier condition vicious temper most light furniture reduce matchwood glass door bookcase star shiver precious egyptian pottery glass strewn fragment carpet mummy smile same enigmatic cheerfulness seem suffer professorial hoof 
74,"Horace instinctively felt that any words of conventional sympathy would jar here; indeed, the Professor's attitude and expression reminded him irresistibly of a certain ""Blondin Donkey"" he had seen enacted by music-hall artists, at the point where it becomes sullen and defiant. Only, he had laughed helplessly at the Blondin Donkey, and somehow he felt no inclination to laugh now.",feel word conventional sympathy jar attitude expression remind certain see enact music hall artist point become sullen defiant laugh feel inclination laugh 
75,"""Believe me, sir,"" he began, ""I would not disturb you like this unless--steady there, for Heaven's sake Professor, don't kick till you've heard me out!"" For, the mule, in a clumsy, shambling way which betrayed the novice, was slowly revolving on his own axis so as to bring his hind-quarters into action, while still keeping his only serviceable eye upon his unwelcome visitor.",believe sir begin disturb steady sake kick hear mule clumsy shambling way betray novice revolve own axis bring hind quarter action keep only serviceable eye unwelcome visitor 
76,"""Listen to me, sir,"" said Horace, manoeuvring in his turn. ""I'm not to blame for this, and if you brain me, as you seem to be endeavouring to do, you'll simply destroy the only living man who can get you out of this.""",listen sir say manoeuvr turn blame brain seem endeavour do destroy only living man get 
77,"The mule appeared impressed by this, and backed cumbrously into a corner, from which he regarded Horace with a mistrustful, but attentive, eye. ""If, as I imagine, sir,"" continued Horace, ""you are, though temporarily deprived of speech, perfectly capable of following an argument, will you kindly signify it by raising your right ear?"" The mule's right ear rose with a sharp twitch.",mule appear impress back corner regard mistrustful attentive eye imagine sir continue deprive speech capable follow argument signify raise right ear mule right ear rise sharp twitch 
78,"""Now we can get on,"" said Horace. ""First let me tell you that I repudiate all responsibility for the proceedings of that infernal Jinnee.... I wouldn't stamp like that--you might go through the floor, you know.... Now, if you will only exercise a little patience----""",get say let tell repudiate responsibility proceedings infernal stamp go floor know exercise little patience 
79,"At this the exasperated animal made a sudden run at him with his mouth open, which obliged Horace to shelter himself behind a large leather arm-chair. ""You really _must_ keep cool, sir,"" he remonstrated; ""your nerves are naturally upset. If I might suggest a little champagne--you could manage it in--in a bucket, and it would help you to pull yourself together. A whisk of your--er--tail would imply consent."" The Professor's tail instantly swept some rare Arabian glass lamps and vases from a shelf at his rear, whereupon Mrs. Futvoye went out, and returned presently with a bottle of champagne and a large china _jardinière_, as the best substitute she could find for a bucket.",exasperated animal make sudden run mouth open oblige shelter large leather arm chair keep cool sir remonstrate nerve upset suggest little champagne manage bucket help pull whisk er tail imply consent tail sweep rare arabian glass lamp vase shelf rear go return bottle champagne large china _jardinière_ good substitute find bucket 
80,"When the mule had drained the flower-pot greedily and appeared refreshed, Horace proceeded: ""I have every hope, sir,"" he said, ""that before many hours you will be smiling--pray don't prance like that, I mean what I say--smiling over what now seems to you, very justly, a most annoying and serious catastrophe. I shall speak seriously to Fakrash (the Jinnee, you know), and I am sure that, as soon as he realises what a frightful blunder he has made, he will be the first to offer you every reparation in his power. For, old foozle as he is, he's thoroughly good-hearted.""",mule drain flower pot appear refresh proceed have hope sir say many hour smile pray prance mean say smile seem annoying serious catastrophe speak know sure realise frightful blunder make first offer reparation power old foozle good hearted 
81,"The Professor drooped his ears at this, and shook his head with a doleful incredulity that made him look more like the Pantomime Donkey than ever.",droop ear shake head doleful incredulity make look 
82,"""I think I understand him fairly well by this time, sir,"" said Horace, ""and I'll answer for it that there's no real harm in him. I give you my word of honour that, if you'll only remain quiet and leave everything to me, you shall very soon be released from this absurd position. That's all I came to tell you, and now I won't trouble you any longer. If you _could_ bring yourself, as a sign that you bear me no ill-feeling, to give me your--your off-foreleg at parting, I----""",think understand time sir say answer be real harm give word honour remain quiet leave release absurd position come tell trouble bring sign bear ill feeling give foreleg parting 
83,"But the Professor turned his back in so pointed and ominous a manner that Horace judged it better to withdraw without insisting further. ""I'm afraid,"" he said to Mrs. Futvoye, after they had rejoined Sylvia in the drawing-room--""I'm afraid your husband is still a little sore with me about this miserable business.""",turn back pointed ominous manner judge good withdraw insist afraid say rejoin draw room afraid husband little sore miserable business 
84,"""I don't know what else you can expect,"" replied the lady, rather tartly; ""he can't help feeling--as we all must and do, after what you said just now--that, but for you, this would never have happened!""",know else expect reply lady help feel do say happen 
85,"""If you mean it was all through my attending that sale,"" said Horace, ""you might remember that I only went there at the Professor's request. You know that, Sylvia.""",mean attend sale say remember go request know 
86,"""Yes, Horace,"" said Sylvia; ""but papa never asked you to buy a hideous brass bottle with a nasty Genius in it. And any one with ordinary common sense would have kept it properly corked!""",say ask buy hideous brass bottle nasty genius one ordinary common sense keep cork 
87,"""What, you against me too, Sylvia!"" cried Horace, cut to the quick.",cry cut quick 
88,"""No, Horace, never against you. I didn't mean to say what I did. Only it _is_ such a relief to put the blame on somebody. I know, I _know_ you feel it almost as much as we do.

91,"Horace recognised that no appeal would draw a more definite answer from her just then; so he took his leave, with the feeling that, after all, matters must improve before very long, and in the meantime he must bear the suspense with patience.",recognise appeal draw definite answer take leave feeling matter improve meantime bear suspense patience 
92,"He got through dinner as well as he could in his own rooms, for he did not like to go to his club lest the Jinnee should suddenly return during his absence.",get dinner own room like go club return absence 
93,"""If he wants me he'd be quite equal to coming on to the club after me,"" he reflected, ""for he has about as much sense of the fitness of things as Mary's lamb. I shouldn't care about seeing him suddenly bursting through the floor of the smoking-room. Nor would the committee.""",want equal come club reflect have much sense fitness thing lamb care see burst floor smoking room committee 
94,"He sat up late, in the hope that Fakrash would appear; but the Jinnee made no sign, and Horace began to get uneasy. ""I wish there was some way of ringing him up,"" he thought. ""If he were only the slave of a ring or a lamp, I'd rub it; but it wouldn't be any use to rub that bottle--and, besides, he isn't a slave. Probably he has a suspicion that he has not exactly distinguished himself over his latest feat, and thinks it prudent to keep out of my way for the present.

95,"It was maddening to think of the unhappy Professor still fretting away hour after hour in the uncongenial form of a mule, waiting impatiently for the relief that never came. If it lingered much longer, he might actually starve, unless his family thought of getting in some oats for him, and he could be prevailed upon to touch them. And how much longer could they succeed in concealing the nature of his affliction?
