2," Ten minutes later, and without, as Jane Sheepshanks said, ""so muckle as a sponge or a brush-and-comb being laid upon them,"" the three stood before their father. Silently Janet had introduced them, and now as silently she stood aside to listen to the evidence--and, as she put it, ""keep the maister to his duty, and mind him o' his responsibilities to them that's gane.""",minute say sponge brush comb lay stand father introduce stand listen evidence put keep maister duty mind responsibility gane 
3,"Janet Sheepshanks never forgot that she had been maid for twenty years to the dead mother of the children, nor that she had received ""the bits o' weans"" at her hand as a dying charge. She considered herself, with some reason, to be the direct representative of the missing parent, and referred to Priscilla, Toady Lion, and Hugh John as ""my bairns,"" just as, in moments of affection, she would still speak to them of ""my bonnie lassie your mither,"" as if the dead woman were still one of her flock.",forget maid year dead mother child receive bit wean hand die charge consider reason direct representative missing parent refer bairn moment affection speak bonnie lassie mither dead woman flock 
4,"For a full minute Mr. Picton Smith gazed speechless at the spectacle before him. He had been writing something that crinkled his brow and compressed his lips, and at the patter of the children's feet in the passage outside his door, as they ceremoniously marshalled themselves to enter, he had turned about on his great office chair with a smile of expectation and anticipation. The door opened, and Janet Sheepshanks pushed in first Sir Toady Lion, still voluble and calling for vengeance on the ""bad, bad boys at the castle that had striked him and hurted his dear Prissy."" Priscilla herself stood white-lipped and dumb, and through the awful silence pulsed the dry, recurrent, sobbing catch in the throat of Hugh John.",full minute gaze speechless spectacle write crinkle brow compress lip patter child foot passage door marshall enter turn great office chair smile expectation anticipation door open push first voluble call vengeance bad bad boy castle strike hurt dear prissy stand white lipped dumb awful silence pulse dry recurrent sobb catch throat 
5,"Mr. Picton Smith was a stern man, whose great loss had caused him to shut up the springs of his tenderness from the world. But they flowed the sweeter and the rarer underneath; and though his grave and dignified manner daunted his children on the occasion of any notable evil-doing, they had no reason to be afraid of him.",stern man great loss cause shut spring tenderness world flow sweeter rarer grave dignified manner daunt child occasion notable evil do have reason afraid 
6,"""Well, what is the meaning of this?"" he said, his face falling into a greyer and graver silence at the sound of Hugh John's sobs, and turning to Priscilla for explanation.",meaning say face fall greyer graver silence sound sob turn explanation 
7,Meanwhile Sir Toady Lion was pursuing the subject with his usual shrill alacrity.,pursue subject usual shrill alacrity 
8,"""Be quiet, sir,"" said his father. ""I will hear you all one by one, but let Priscilla begin--she is the eldest.""",quiet sir say father hear let begin old 
9,"""We went to the castle after dinner, over by the stepping-stones,"" began Priscilla, fingering nervously the frill of the torn pinafore about her throat, ""and when we got to the castle we found out that our pet lamb Donald had come after us by the ford; and he was going everywhere about the castle, trying to rub his bell off his neck on the gate-posts and on the stones at the corners.""",go castle dinner step stone begin finger frill torn pinafore throat get castle find pet lamb come ford go castle try rub bell neck gate post stone corner

11,"""And then we played on the grass in the inside of the castle. Toady Lion and I were plaiting daisy-chains and garlands for Donald, and Hugh John was playing at being the Prisoner of Chillyon: he had tied himself to the gate-post with a rope.""",play grass inside castle plait daisy chain garland play tie gate post rope

13,"""And it rattled,"" added Sir Toady Lion, not to be out of the running.",rattle add running 
14,"""And just when we were playing nicely, a lot of horrid boys from the town came swarming and clambering in. They had run over the bridge and climbed the gate, and then they began calling us names and throwing mud. So Hugh John said he would tell on them.""",play lot horrid boy town come swarm clamber run bridge climb gate begin call name throw mud say tell 
15,"""Didn't,"" interrupted Hugh John indignantly. ""I said I'd knock the heads off them if they didn't stop and get out; and they only laughed and said things about father. So I hit one of them with a stone.""",interrupt say knock head stop get laugh say thing father hit stone 
16,"""Then,"" continued Priscilla, gaining confidence from a certain curious spark of light which began to burn steadily in her father's eyes, ""after Hugh John threw the stone, the horrid boys all came and said that they would kill us, and that we had no business there anyway.""",continue gain confidence certain curious spark light begin burn father eye throw stone horrid boy come say kill have business

First he knocked down one or two of them, and then they put a rope round his neck and began to take rides on his back.""",black pet lamb come court run catch knock put rope neck begin take ride back

29,"""He was overcome with rage and anger""--at this point Priscilla began to talk by the book, the dignity of the epic tale working on her--""and he rushed upon them fearlessly, though they were ten to one; and they all struck him and kicked him. But Hugh John fought like a lion.""",overcome rage anger point begin talk book dignity epic tale work rush strike kick fight lion

31,"""And I went to their assistance and fought as Hugh John showed me. And--I forget the rest,"" said Priscilla, her epic style suddenly failing her. Also she felt she must begin to cry very soon, now the strain was over. So she made haste to finish. ""But it was dreadful, and they swore, and said they would cut Donald's throat. And one boy took out a great knife and said he knew how to do it. He was the butch----""",go assistance fight show forget rest say epic style fail feel begin cry strain make haste finish dreadful swore say cut throat boy take great knife say know do butch

35,"""And when I looked up again they had taken away p-p-poor Donald,"" Priscilla went on spasmodically between her tears, ""and I think they killed him because he belonged to you, and--they said he had no business there! Oh, they were such horrid cruel boys, and much bigger than us. And I can't bear that Don should have his throat cut. I was promised that he should never be sold for mutton, but only clipped for wool. And he had such a pretty throat to hang daisy-chains on, and was such a dear, dear thing.""",look take p p poor go tear think kill belong say have business such horrid cruel boy big bear have throat cut promise sell mutton clippe wool have pretty throat hang daisy chain dear dear thing

37,"There was only anger against the enemy now, and no thought of chastisement of his own in the heart of Mr. Picton Smith. He was rising to reach out his hand to his riding-whip, when General Napoleon Smith, who, like most great makers of history, had taken little part in the telling of it, created a diversion which put all thought of immediate action out of his father's head. He had been standing up, shoulders squared, arms dressed to his side, head erect, as he had seen Sergeant Steel do when he spoke to his Colonel. Once or twice he had swayed slightly, but the heart of the Buonapartes, which beat bravely in his bosom, brought him up again all standing. Nevertheless he grew even whiter and whiter, till, all in a moment, he gave a little lurch forward, checked himself, and again looked straight before him. Then he sobbed out once suddenly and helplessly, said ""I couldn't help getting beaten, father--there were too many of them!"" and fell over all of a piece on the hearthrug.",be anger enemy thought chastisement own heart rise reach hand riding whip most great maker history take little part telling create diversion put thought immediate action father head stand shoulder square arm dress side head erect see do speak sway heart beat bosom bring standing grow whit whit moment give little lurch check look sobb say help beat father be many fall piece hearthrug
