1,CHAPTER 13. THE ROBBER AND THE BURGLAR,chapter robber burglar 
2,"A day or two after Noel came back from Hastings there was snow; it was jolly. And we cleared it off the path. A man to do it is sixpence at least, and you should always save when you can. A penny saved is a penny earned. And then we thought it would be nice to clear it off the top of the portico, where it lies so thick, and the edges as if they had been cut with a knife. And just as we had got out of the landing-window on to the portico, the Water Rates came up the path with his book that he tears the thing out of that says how much you have got to pay, and the little ink-bottle hung on to his buttonhole in case you should pay him. Father says the Water Rates is a sensible man, and knows it is always well to be prepared for whatever happens, however unlikely. Alice said afterwards that she rather liked the Water Rates, really, and Noel said he had a face like a good vizier, or the man who rewards the honest boy for restoring the purse, but we did not think about these things at the time, and as the Water Rates came up the steps, we shovelled down a great square slab of snow like an avalanche--and it fell right on his head. Two of us thought of it at the same moment, so it was quite a large avalanche. And when the Water Rates had shaken himself he rang the bell. It was Saturday, and Father was at home. We know now that it is very wrong and ungentlemanly to shovel snow off porticoes on to the Water Rates, or any other person, and we hope he did not catch a cold, and we are very sorry. We apologized to the Water Rates when Father told us to. We were all sent to bed for it.",day come be snow jolly clear path man do least save penny save penny earn think nice clear top portico lie thick edge cut knife get landing window portico come path book tear thing say much get pay little ink bottle hang buttonhole case pay father say sensible man know well prepare happen unlikely say like say have face good vizier man reward honest boy restore purse think thing time come step shovell great square slab snow avalanche fall head think same moment large avalanche shake ring bell home know wrong ungentlemanly shovel snow porticoe other person hope catch cold sorry apologize tell send bed 
3,"We all deserved the punishment, because the others would have shovelled down snow just as we did if they’d thought of it--only they are not so quick at thinking of things as we are. And even quite wrong things sometimes lead to adventures; as every one knows who has ever read about pirates or highwaymen.",deserve punishment other shovell snow do think quick think thing wrong thing lead adventure one know read pirate highwaymen 
4,"Eliza hates us to be sent to bed early, because it means her having to bring meals up, and it means lighting the fire in Noel’s room ever so much earlier than usual. He had to have a fire because he still had a bit of a cold. But this particular day we got Eliza into a good temper by giving her a horrid brooch with pretending amethysts in it, that an aunt once gave to Alice, so Eliza brought up an extra scuttle of coals, and when the greengrocer came with the potatoes (he is always late on Saturdays) she got some chestnuts from him. So that when we heard Father go out after his dinner, there was a jolly fire in Noel’s room, and we were able to go in and be Red Indians in blankets most comfortably. Eliza had gone out; she says she gets things cheaper on Saturday nights. She has a great friend, who sells fish at a shop, and he is very generous, and lets her have herrings for less than half the natural price.",hate send bed mean have bring meal mean light fire room usual have have fire have bit cold particular day get good temper give horrid brooch pretend amethyst aunt give bring extra scuttle coal greengrocer come potato late get chestnut hear father go dinner be jolly fire room able go red blanket go say get thing cheap night have great friend sell fish shop generous let have herring less natural price 
5,"So we were all alone in the house; Pincher was out with Eliza, and we talked about robbers. And Dora thought it would be a dreadful trade, but Dicky said--",alone house talk robber think dreadful trade say 
6,"‘I think it would be very interesting. And you would only rob rich people, and be very generous to the poor and needy, like Claude Duval.’ Dora said, ‘It is wrong to be a robber.’",think interesting rob rich person generous poor needy say wrong robber 
7,"‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘you would never know a happy hour. Think of trying to sleep with the stolen jewels under your bed, and remembering all the quantities of policemen and detectives that there are in the world!’",say know happy hour think try sleep steal jewel bed remember quantity policemen detective be world 
8,"‘There are ways of being robbers that are not wrong,’ said Noel; ‘if you can rob a robber it is a right act.’",be way robber wrong say rob robber right act 
9,"‘But you can’t,’ said Dora; ‘he is too clever, and besides, it’s wrong anyway.’",say clever wrong 
10,"‘Yes you can, and it isn’t; and murdering him with boiling oil is a right act, too, so there!’ said Noel. ‘What about Ali Baba? Now then!’ And we felt it was a score for Noel.",murdering boil oil right act say feel score 
11,‘What would you do if there _was_ a robber?’ said Alice.,do robber say 
12,H. O. said he would kill him with boiling oil; but Alice explained that she meant a real robber--now--this minute--in the house.,say kill boil oil explain mean real robber minute house 
13,"Oswald and Dicky did not say; but Noel said he thought it would only be fair to ask the robber quite politely and quietly to go away, and then if he didn’t you could deal with him.",say say think fair ask robber go deal 
14,"Now what I am going to tell you is a very strange and wonderful thing, and I hope you will be able to believe it. I should not, if a boy told me, unless I knew him to be a man of honour, and perhaps not then unless he gave his sacred word. But it is true, all the same, and it only shows that the days of romance and daring deeds are not yet at an end.",go tell strange wonderful thing hope able believe boy tell know man honour give sacred word true same show day romance dare deed end 
15,"Alice was just asking Noel _how_ he would deal with the robber who wouldn’t go if he was asked politely and quietly, when we heard a noise downstairs--quite a plain noise, not the kind of noise you fancy you hear. It was like somebody moving a chair. We held our breath and listened and then came another noise, like some one poking a fire. Now, you remember there was no one _to_ poke a fire or move a chair downstairs, because Eliza and Father were both out. They could not have come in without our hearing them, because the front door is as hard to shut as the back one, and whichever you go in by you have to give a slam that you can hear all down the street.",ask deal robber go ask hear noise plain noise kind noise fancy hear move chair hold breath listen come noise one poke fire remember be poke fire move chair come hearing front door hard shut back one go have give slam hear street 
16,"H. O. and Alice and Dora caught hold of each other’s blankets and looked at Dicky and Oswald, and every one was quite pale. And Noel whispered--",catch hold other blanket look one pale whisper 
17,"‘It’s ghosts, I know it is’--and then we listened again, but there was no more noise. Presently Dora said in a whisper--",ghost know listen be more noise say whisper 
18,"‘Whatever shall we do? Oh, whatever shall we do--what _shall_ we do?’ And she kept on saying it till we had to tell her to shut up.",do do _shall_ do keep say have tell shut 
19,"O reader, have you ever been playing Red Indians in blankets round a bedroom fire in a house where you thought there was no one but you--and then suddenly heard a noise like a chair, and a fire being poked, downstairs? Unless you have you will not be able to imagine at all what it feels like. It was not like in books; our hair did not stand on end at all, and we never said ‘Hist!’ once, but our feet got very cold, though we were in blankets by the fire, and the insides of Oswald’s hands got warm and wet, and his nose was cold like a dog’s, and his ears were burning hot.",reader play red blanket bedroom fire house think be hear noise chair fire poke have able imagine feel book hair stand end say foot get cold blanket fire inside hand get warm wet nose cold dog ear burn hot 
20,"The girls said afterwards that they shivered with terror, and their teeth chattered, but we did not see or hear this at the time.",girl say shiver terror tooth chatter see hear time 
21,"‘Shall we open the window and call police?’ said Dora; and then Oswald suddenly thought of something, and he breathed more freely and he said--",open window call police say think breathe say 
22,"‘I _know_ it’s not ghosts, and I don’t believe it’s robbers. I expect it’s a stray cat got in when the coals came this morning, and she’s been hiding in the cellar, and now she’s moving about. Let’s go down and see.’",ghost believe robber expect stray cat get coal come morning hide cellar move let go see 
23,"The girls wouldn’t, of course; but I could see that they breathed more freely too. But Dicky said, ‘All right; I will if you will.’",girl course see breathe say right 
24,"H. O. said, ‘Do you think it’s _really_ a cat?’ So we said he had better stay with the girls. And of course after that we had to let him and Alice both come. Dora said if we took Noel down with his cold, she would scream ‘Fire!’ and ‘Murder!’ and she didn’t mind if the whole street heard.",say think cat say have good stay girl course have let come say take cold scream murder mind whole street hear 
25,"So Noel agreed to be getting his clothes on, and the rest of us said we would go down and look for the cat.",agree get clothes rest say go look cat 
26,"Now Oswald _said_ that about the cat, and it made it easier to go down, but in his inside he did not feel at all sure that it might not be robbers after all. Of course, we had often talked about robbers before, but it is very different when you sit in a room and listen and listen and listen; and Oswald felt somehow that it would be easier to go down and see what it was, than to wait, and listen, and wait, and wait, and listen, and wait, and then perhaps to hear _it_, whatever it was, come creeping slowly up the stairs as softly as _it_ could with _its_ boots off, and the stairs creaking, towards the room where we were with the door open in case of Eliza coming back suddenly, and all dark on the landings. And then it would have been just as bad, and it would have lasted longer, and you would have known you were a coward besides. Dicky says he felt all these same things. Many people would say we were young heroes to go down as we did; so I have tried to explain, because no young hero wishes to have more credit than he deserves.",cat make easy go inside feel sure robber course talk robber different sit room listen listen listen feel easy go see wait listen wait wait listen wait hear come creep stair _its_ boot stair creak room door open case come dark landing bad last know coward say feel same thing many person say young hero go try explain young hero wish have more credit deserve 
27,"The landing gas was turned down low--just a blue bead--and we four went out very softly, wrapped in our blankets, and we stood on the top of the stairs a good long time before we began to go down. And we listened and listened till our ears buzzed.",landing gas turn low blue bead go wrap blanket stand top stair good long time begin go listen listen ear buzz 
28,"And Oswald whispered to Dicky, and Dicky went into our room and fetched the large toy pistol that is a foot long, and that has the trigger broken, and I took it because I am the eldest; and I don’t think either of us thought it was the cat now. But Alice and H. O. did. Dicky got the poker out of Noel’s room, and told Dora it was to settle the cat with when we caught her.",whisper go room fetched large toy pistol foot long have trigger break take old think think cat get poker room tell settle cat catch 
29,"Then Oswald whispered, ‘Let’s play at burglars; Dicky and I are armed to the teeth, we will go first. You keep a flight behind us, and be a reinforcement if we are attacked. Or you can retreat and defend the women and children in the fortress, if you’d rather.’",whisper let play burglar armed tooth go keep flight reinforcement attack retreat defend woman child fortress 
30,But they said they would be a reinforcement.,say reinforcement 
31,Oswald’s teeth chattered a little when he spoke. It was not with anything else except cold.,tooth chatter little speak else cold 
32,"So Dicky and Oswald crept down, and when we got to the bottom of the stairs, we saw Father’s study door just ajar, and the crack of light. And Oswald was so pleased to see the light, knowing that burglars prefer the dark, or at any rate the dark lantern, that he felt really sure it _was_ the cat after all, and then he thought it would be fun to make the others upstairs think it was really a robber. So he cocked the pistol--you can cock it, but it doesn’t go off--and he said, ‘Come on, Dick!’ and he rushed at the study door and burst into the room, crying, ‘Surrender! you are discovered! Surrender, or I fire! Throw up your hands!’",creep get bottom stair see study door ajar crack light pleased see light know burglar prefer dark rate dark lantern feel sure cat think fun make other think robber cocked pistol cock go say come rush study door burst room cry surrender discover surrender fire throw hand 
33,"And, as he finished saying it, he saw before him, standing on the study hearthrug, a Real Robber. There was no mistake about it. Oswald was sure it was a robber, because it had a screwdriver in its hands, and was standing near the cupboard door that H. O. broke the lock off; and there were gimlets and screws and things on the floor. There is nothing in that cupboard but old ledgers and magazines and the tool chest, but of course, a robber could not know that beforehand.",finish say see stand study hearthrug real be mistake sure robber have screwdriver hand stand cupboard door break lock be gimlet screw thing floor be cupboard old ledger magazine tool chest course robber know 
34,"When Oswald saw that there really was a robber, and that he was so heavily armed with the screwdriver, he did not feel comfortable. But he kept the pistol pointed at the robber, and--you will hardly believe it, but it is true--the robber threw down the screwdriver clattering on the other tools, and he _did_ throw up his hands, and said--",see be robber armed screwdriver feel comfortable keep pistol point robber believe true robber throw screwdriver clatter other tool throw hand say 
35,‘I surrender; don’t shoot me! How many of you are there?’,surrender shoot many 
36,"So Dicky said, ‘You are outnumbered. Are you armed?’",say outnumber armed 
37,"And the robber said, ‘No, not in the least.’",robber say least 
38,"And Oswald said, still pointing the pistol, and feeling very strong and brave and as if he was in a book, ‘Turn out your pockets.’",say point pistol feel strong brave book turn pocket 
39,"The robber did: and while he turned them out, we looked at him. He was of the middle height, and clad in a black frock-coat and grey trousers. His boots were a little gone at the sides, and his shirt-cuffs were a bit frayed, but otherwise he was of gentlemanly demeanour. He had a thin, wrinkled face, with big, light eyes that sparkled, and then looked soft very queerly, and a short beard. In his youth it must have been of a fair golden colour, but now it was tinged with grey. Oswald was sorry for him, especially when he saw that one of his pockets had a large hole in it, and that he had nothing in his pockets but letters and string and three boxes of matches, and a pipe and a handkerchief and a thin tobacco pouch and two pennies. We made him put all the things on the table, and then he said--",robber turn look middle height clad black frock coat grey trousers boot little gone side shirt cuff bit fray gentlemanly demeanour have thin wrinkled face big light eye sparkle look soft short beard youth fair golden colour ting grey sorry see pocket have large hole have pocket letter string box match pipe handkerchief thin tobacco pouch penny make put thing table say 
40,"‘Well, you’ve caught me; what are you going to do with me? Police?’",catch go do police 
41,"Alice and H. O. had come down to be reinforcements, when they heard a shout, and when Alice saw that it was a Real Robber, and that he had surrendered, she clapped her hands and said, ‘Bravo, boys!’ and so did H. O. And now she said, ‘If he gives his word of honour not to escape, I shouldn’t call the police: it seems a pity. Wait till Father comes home.’",come reinforcement hear shout see real surrender clapp hand say boy say give word honour escape call police seem pity wait come 
42,"The robber agreed to this, and gave his word of honour, and asked if he might put on a pipe, and we said ‘Yes,’ and he sat in Father’s armchair and warmed his boots, which steamed, and I sent H. O. and Alice to put on some clothes and tell the others, and bring down Dicky’s and my knickerbockers, and the rest of the chestnuts.",robber agree give word honour ask put pipe say sit armchair warm boot steam send put clothes tell other bring knickerbocker rest chestnut 
43,"And they all came, and we sat round the fire, and it was jolly. The robber was very friendly, and talked to us a great deal.",come sit fire jolly robber friendly talk great deal 
44,"‘I wasn’t always in this low way of business,’ he said, when Noel said something about the things he had turned out of his pockets. ‘It’s a great come-down to a man like me. But, if I must be caught, it’s something to be caught by brave young heroes like you. My stars! How you did bolt into the room,--“Surrender, and up with your hands!” You might have been born and bred to the thief-catching.’",low way business say say thing turn pocket great come man catch catch brave young hero star bolt room surrender hand bear breed thief catching 
45,"Oswald is sorry if it was mean, but he could not own up just then that he did not think there was any one in the study when he did that brave if rash act. He has told since.",sorry mean own think be one study do brave rash act tell 
46,"‘And what made you think there was any one in the house?’ the robber asked, when he had thrown his head back, and laughed for quite half a minute. So we told him. And he applauded our valour, and Alice and H. O. explained that they would have said ‘Surrender,’ too, only they were reinforcements. The robber ate some of the chestnuts--and we sat and wondered when Father would come home, and what he would say to us for our intrepid conduct. And the robber told us of all the things he had done before he began to break into houses. Dicky picked up the tools from the floor, and suddenly he said--",think be one house robber ask throw head laugh minute tell applaud valour explain say surrender reinforcement robber eat chestnut sit wonder come say intrepid conduct robber tell thing do begin break house pick tool floor say 
47,"‘Why, this is Father’s screwdriver and his gimlets, and all! Well, I do call it jolly cheek to pick a man’s locks with his own tools!’",screwdriver gimlet call jolly cheek pick man lock own tool 
48,"‘True, true,’ said the robber. ‘It is cheek, of the jolliest! But you see I’ve come down in the world. I was a highway robber once, but horses are so expensive to hire--five shillings an hour, you know--and I couldn’t afford to keep them. The highwayman business isn’t what it was.’",true true say robber cheek jolliest see come world highway robber horse expensive hire shilling hour know afford keep highwayman business 
49,‘What about a bike?’ said H. O.,bike say 
50,"But the robber thought cycles were low--and besides you couldn’t go across country with them when occasion arose, as you could with a trusty steed. And he talked of highwaymen as if he knew just how we liked hearing it.",robber think cycle low go country occasion arise trusty steed talk highwaymen know like hear 
51,"Then he told us how he had been a pirate captain--and how he had sailed over waves mountains high, and gained rich prizes--and how he _did_ begin to think that here he had found a profession to his mind.",tell pirate captain sail wave mountain high gain rich prize begin think find profession mind 
52,"‘I don’t say there are no ups and downs in it,’ he said, ‘especially in stormy weather. But what a trade! And a sword at your side, and the Jolly Roger flying at the peak, and a prize in sight. And all the black mouths of your guns pointed at the laden trader--and the wind in your favour, and your trusty crew ready to live and die for you! Oh--but it’s a grand life!’",say be up down say stormy weather trade sword side fly peak prize sight black mouth gun point laden trader wind favour trusty crew ready live die grand life

55,The robber frowned and sighed.,robber frown sigh 
56,"‘No,’ he said, ‘I was brought up to the law. I was at Balliol, bless your hearts, and that’s true anyway.’ He sighed again, and looked hard at the fire.",say bring law bless heart true sigh look fire 
57,"‘That was my Father’s college,’ H. O. was beginning, but Dicky said--‘Why did you leave off being a pirate?’",college begin say leave pirate

60,"‘Nelson was sea-sick,’ said Oswald.",sea sick say 
61,"‘Ah,’ said the robber; ‘but I hadn’t his luck or his pluck, or something. He stuck to it and won Trafalgar, didn’t he? “Kiss me, Hardy”--and all that, eh? _I_ couldn’t stick to it--I had to resign. And nobody kissed _me_.’",say robber luck pluck stick win kiss stick have resign kiss

66,And again he looked at the fire.,look fire 
67,"Oswald forgot for a minute that the interesting stranger was a robber, and asked him if he wouldn’t have a drink.

And that is right, too.",forget minute interesting stranger robber ask have drink hear father do friend know right thing robber say mind right

70,"‘As a matter of fact,’ he said, ‘I was bush-ranging this afternoon, among the furze-bushes on the Heath, but I had no luck. I stopped the Lord Mayor in his gilt coach, with all his footmen in plush and gold lace, smart as cockatoos. But it was no go. The Lord Mayor hadn’t a stiver in his pockets. One of the footmen had six new pennies: the Lord Mayor always pays his servants’ wages in new pennies. I spent fourpence of that in bread and cheese, that on the table’s the tuppence. Ah, it’s a poor trade!’ And then he filled his pipe again.",matter fact say bush range afternoon furze bush have luck stop gilt coach footmen plush gold lace smart cockatoo go stiver pocket footmen have new penny pay servant wage new penny spend fourpence bread cheese table tuppence poor trade fill pipe 
71,"We had turned out the gas, so that Father should have a jolly good surprise when he did come home, and we sat and talked as pleasant as could be. I never liked a new man better than I liked that robber. And I felt so sorry for him. He told us he had been a war-correspondent and an editor, in happier days, as well as a horse-stealer and a colonel of dragoons.",turn gas father have jolly good surprise come sit talk pleasant like new man good like robber feel sorry tell war correspondent editor happy day horse stealer colonel dragoon

77,"But Dicky and I said we should come. So he let us go as far as the bottom of the kitchen stairs, and we took the tongs and shovel with us. There was a light in the kitchen; a very little light.

The burglar was a large man who did not mean to have a beard, I think, but he had got some of one, and a red comforter, and a fur cap, and his face was red and his voice was thick. How different from our own robber! The burglar had a dark lantern, and he was standing by the plate-basket.

100,"But our robber said no, it wouldn’t be right; we must wait till Father came home. Then H. O. said, very suddenly and plainly:",robber say right wait come say

102,"The minute he’d said it the burglar said, ‘Kidded, by gum!’--and then our robber made a step towards him to catch hold of him, and before you had time to think ‘Hullo!’ the burglar knocked the pistol up with one hand and knocked our robber down with the other, and was off out of the window like a shot, though Oswald and Dicky did try to stop him by holding on to his legs.",minute say burglar say kidd gum robber make step catch hold have time think burglar knock pistol hand knock robber other window shot try stop hold leg 
103,"And that burglar had the cheek to put his head in at the window and say, ‘I’ll give yer love to the kids and the missis’--and he was off like winking, and there were Alice and Dora trying to pick up our robber, and asking him whether he was hurt, and where. He wasn’t hurt at all, except a lump at the back of his head. And he got up, and we dusted the kitchen floor off him. Eliza is a dirty girl.",burglar have cheek put head window say give love kid missis wink be try pick robber ask hurt hurt lump back head get dust kitchen floor dirty girl

Now you’ve had two burglars I daresay you’ll have twenty.’ So we put up the shutters, which Eliza has strict orders to do before she goes out, only she never does, and we went back to Father’s study, and the robber said, ‘What a night we are having!’ and put his boots back in the fender to go on steaming, and then we all talked at once. It was the most wonderful adventure we ever had, though it wasn’t treasure-seeking--at least not ours. I suppose it was the burglar’s treasure-seeking, but he didn’t get much--and our robber said he didn’t believe a word about those kids that were so like Alice and me.",say let put shutter rain pour have burglar daresay have put shutter have strict order do go go study robber say night have put boot fender go steaming talk wonderful adventure have treasure seek least suppose burglar treasure seek get much robber say believe word kid

110,"Father came in quickly, purring with the cold, and began to say, ‘It’s all right, Foulkes, I’ve got--’ And then he stopped short and stared at us. Then he said, in the voice we all hate, ‘Children, what is the meaning of all this?’ And for a minute nobody spoke.",come purr cold begin say right get stop short stare say voice hate child meaning minute speak

I wish my Denny had their pluck.’",mistaken dear sir robber capture young person gallant manner hand surrender fire rest word get kid worth have wish have pluck 
113,"Then we began to understand, and it was like being knocked down, it was so sudden. And our robber told us he wasn’t a robber after all. He was only an old college friend of my Father’s, and he had come after dinner, when Father was just trying to mend the lock H. O. had broken, to ask Father to get him a letter to a doctor about his little boy Denny, who was ill. And Father had gone over the Heath to Vanbrugh Park to see some rich people he knows and get the letter. And he had left Mr Foulkes to wait till he came back, because it was important to know at once whether Father could get the letter, and if he couldn’t Mr Foulkes would have had to try some one else directly.",begin understand knock sudden robber tell robber old college friend come dinner try mend lock break ask father get letter doctor little boy ill go see rich person know get letter leave wait come important know get letter have try one

It must have been moderately entertaining.’",robber tell father other burglar say sorry let escape say right poor beggar have kid home tell forgive debt know tell first business entertaining 
116,"Then our robber told my Father how I had rushed into the room with a pistol, crying out... but you know all about that. And he laid it on so thick and fat about plucky young-uns, and chips of old blocks, and things like that, that I felt I was purple with shame, even under the blanket. So I swallowed that thing that tries to prevent you speaking when you ought to, and I said, ‘Look here, Father, I didn’t really think there was any one in the study. We thought it was a cat at first, and then I thought there was no one there, and I was just larking.

119,"And I was glad I’d owned up, for Father slapped me on the back, and said I was a young brick, and our robber said I was no funk anyway, and though I got very hot under the blanket I liked it, and I explained that the others would have done the same if they had thought of it.",glad own slap back say young brick robber say funk get hot blanket like explain other do same think 
120,"Then Father got up some more beer, and laughed about Dora’s responsibility, and he got out a box of figs he had bought for us, only he hadn’t given it to us because of the Water Rates, and Eliza came in and brought up the bread and cheese, and what there was left of the neck of mutton--cold wreck of mutton, Father called it--and we had a feast--like a picnic--all sitting anywhere, and eating with our fingers. It was prime. We sat up till past twelve o’clock, and I never felt so pleased to think I was not born a girl. It was hard on the others; they would have done just the same if they’d thought of it.
