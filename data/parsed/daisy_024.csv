7,"Alan wrote in high terms of his captain, declaring that he esteemed the having sailed with him as one of the greatest advantages he had ever received, and adding that, for his own part, Dr. May needed no promise from him to be assured that he would watch over Harry like his own brother. It was believed that the Alcestis was destined for the South American station.",write high term captain declare esteem sail great advantage receive add own part need promise assure watch own brother believe destine american station

14,"It was one of the quiet afternoons, when all the rest were out, and which the doctor and his daughter especially valued, when they were able to spend one together without interruption. Soon, however, a ring at the door brought an impatient exclamation from the doctor; but his smile beamed out at the words, “Miss Rivers.” They were great friends; in fact, on terms of some mutual sauciness, though Meta was, as yet, far less at home with his daughters, and came in, looking somewhat shy.",quiet afternoon rest doctor daughter value able spend interruption ring door bring impatient exclamation doctor smile beam word great friend fact term mutual sauciness less home daughter come look shy

32,"“I have done everything wrong, it seems,” said Meta, with a shade of what the French call depit. “I thought it must be right and good--but it has only done mischief; and now papa says they are an ungrateful set, and that, if it vexes me, I had better have no more to do with them!”",do wrong seem say shade french call depit think right good do mischief say ungrateful set vexe have more do

Last Sunday she told me she thought I had better have a steadier class, and I know whom she will give me--the great big, stupid ones, at the bottom of the first class!

43,"Margaret made her perceive that the doctor was smiling, and she changed her tone, and earnestly begged to be told what they thought of the case; for if she should show her concern at home, her father and governess would immediately beg her to cease from all connection with the school, and she did not feel at all convinced that Mrs. Wilmot liked to have her there. Feeling injured by the implied accusation of mismanagement, yet, with a sense of its truth, used to be petted, and new to rebuffs, yet with a sincere wish to act rightly, she was much perplexed by this, her first reverse, and had come partly with the view of consulting Flora, though she had fallen on other counsellors.",make perceive doctor smile change tone begg tell think case show concern home father governess beg cease connection school feel convince like have feel injure imply accusation mismanagement sense truth use pett new rebuff sincere wish act perplex first reverse come view consult fall other counsellor

56,"Margaret eagerly inquired, and it appeared that the bishop had given notice for a Confirmation in August, and that Mr. Wilmot was already beginning to prepare his candidates, whilst Mr. Ramsden, always tardy, never gave notice till the last moment possible. The hope was expressed that Harry might be able to profit by this opportunity; and Harry’s prospects were explained to Meta; then the doctor, recollecting something that he wished to say to Mr. Rivers, began to ask about the chance of his coming before the time of an engagement of his own.",inquire appear bishop give notice confirmation begin prepare candidate tardy give notice last moment possible hope express able profit opportunity prospect explain doctor recollect wish say begin ask chance come time engagement own

It is about five miles from the Milbury Station, and we thought of letting her go with a day-ticket to see about her. She could go in the morning, after I am up; but I don’t know what is to be done, for she could not get back before I dress for dinner.”",afraid maid mother ill afraid nurse mile think let go day ticket see go morning know do get dress dinner

The only daughter was a lady’s-maid, and could not be spared, though the brother was half crazy to see her, and there was no one to tend them but a wretch of a woman, paid by the parish. The poor fellow kept calling for his sister in his delirium, and, at last, I could not help writing to the mistress.”",be sad case family mother die linger illness son meet bad accident only daughter lady maid spare brother crazy see be tend wretch woman pay parish poor fellow keep call sister delirium last help write mistress

72,“Surely she stayed!”,stay 
73,"“It was as much as her place was worth,” said the doctor; “and her wages were the chief maintenance of the family.

She did give warning then, but, before the month was out, the mother was dead.”",much place worth say doctor wage chief maintenance family have go dress mistress old woman lay wail give warning month mother dead 
74,"Meta did not speak, and Dr. May presently rose, saying he should try to meet Mr. Rivers in the town, and went out. Meta sat thoughtful, and at last, sighing, said, “I wonder whether Bellairs’s mother is so very ill? I have a great mind to let Susan try to do my hair, and let Bellairs stay a little longer. I never thought of that.”",speak rise say try meet town go sit thoughtful last sigh say wonder mother ill have great mind let try do hair let stay little think

82,"Meta looked half puzzled, half thoughtful, and Margaret, who was a little uneasy at the style of counsel she found herself giving, changed the conversation.",look half puzzle thoughtful little uneasy style counsel find give change conversation 
83,"It was a memorable one to little Miss Rivers, opening out to her, as did almost all her meetings with that family, a new scope for thought and for duty. The code to which she had been brought up taught that servants were the machines of their employer’s convenience. Good-nature occasioned much kindliness of manner and intercourse, and every luxury and indulgence was afforded freely; but where there was any want of accordance between the convenience of the two parties, there was no question. The master must be the first object, the servants’ remedy was in their own hands.",memorable one little open do meeting family new scope thought duty code bring teach servant machine employer convenience good nature occasion much kindliness manner intercourse luxury indulgence afford be want accordance convenience party be question master first object servant remedy own hand 
84,"Amiable as was Mr. Rivers, this, merely from indulgence and want of reflection, was his principle; and his daughter had only been acting on it, though she did not know it, till the feelings that she had never thought of were thus displayed before her. These were her first practical lessons that life was not meant to be passed in pleasing ourselves, and being good-natured at small cost.",amiable indulgence want reflection principle daughter act know feeling think display first practical lesson life mean pass pleasing good natured small cost 
85,"It was an effort. Meta was very dependent, never having been encouraged to be otherwise, and Bellairs was like a necessary of life in her estimation; but strength of principle came to aid her naturally kind-hearted feeling, and she was pleased by the idea of voluntarily undergoing a privation so as to test her sincerity.",effort dependent encourage necessary life estimation strength principle come aid kind hearted feeling pleased idea undergo privation test sincerity 
86,"So when her father told her of the inconvenient times of the trains, and declared that Bellairs must give it up, she answered by proposing to let her sleep a night or two there, gaily promised to manage very well, and satisfied him.",father tell inconvenient time train declare give answer propose let sleep night promise manage satisfy 
87,"Her maid’s grateful looks and thanks recompensed her when she made the offer to her, and inspirited her to an energetic coaxing of Mrs. Larpent, who, being more fully aware than her father of the needfulness of the lady’s-maid, and also very anxious that her darling should appear to the best advantage before the expected aunt, Lady Leonora Langdale, was unwilling to grant more than one night at the utmost.",maid grateful look thanks recompens make offer inspirite energetic coaxing aware father needfulness lady maid anxious darling appear good advantage expect aunt unwilling grant more night utmost 
88,"Meta carried the day, and her last assurance to Bellairs was that she might stay as long as seemed necessary to make her mother comfortable.",carry day last assurance stay seem necessary make mother comfortable 
89,"Thereupon Meta found herself more helpful in some matters than she had expected, but at a loss in others. Susan, with all Mrs. Larpent’s supervision, could not quite bring her dress to the air that was so peculiarly graceful and becoming; and she often caught her papa’s eye looking at her as if he saw something amiss, and could not discover what it was. Then came Aunt Leonora, always very kind to Meta, but the dread of the rest of the household, whom she was wont to lecture on the proper care of her niece. Miss Rivers was likely to have a considerable fortune, and Lady Leonora intended her to be a very fashionable and much admired young lady, under her own immediate protection.",find helpful matter expect loss other supervision bring dress air graceful become catch papa eye look see amiss discover come kind dread rest household wont lecture proper care niece likely have considerable fortune intend fashionable admire young lady own immediate protection 
90,"The two cousins, Leonora and Agatha, talked to her; the one of her balls, the other of her music--patronised her, and called her their good little cousin--while they criticised the stiff set of those unfortunate plaits made by Susan, and laughed, as if it was an unheard-of concession, at Bellairs’s holiday.",cousin talk ball other music- patronise call good little cousin criticise stiff set unfortunate plait make laugh unheard concession holiday 
91,"Nevertheless, when “Honoured Miss” received a note, begging for three days’ longer grace, till a niece should come, in whom Bellairs could place full confidence, she took it on herself to return free consent. Lady Leonora found out what she had done, and reproved her, telling her it was only the way to make “those people” presume, and Mrs. Larpent was also taken to task; but, decidedly, Meta did not regret what she had done, though she felt as if she had never before known how to appreciate comfort, when she once more beheld Bellairs stationed at her toilette table.",honoure receive note begg day long grace niece come place full confidence take return free consent find do reprove tell way make person presume take task regret do feel know appreciate comfort beheld station toilette table 
92,Meta was asked about her friends. She could not mention any one but Mrs. Charles Wilmot and the Misses May.,ask friend mention one 
93,“Physician’s daughters; oh!” said Lady Leonora.,physician daughter say 
94,"And she proceeded to exhort Mr. Rivers to bring his daughter to London, or its neighbourhood, where she might have masters, and be in the way of forming intimacies suited to her connections.",proceed exhort bring daughter neighbourhood have master way form intimacy suit connection 
95,"Mr. Rivers dreaded London--never was well there, and did not like the trouble of moving--while Meta was so attached to the Grange, that she entreated him not to think of leaving it, and greatly dreaded her aunt’s influence. Lady Leonora did, indeed, allow that the Grange was a very pretty place; her only complaint was the want of suitable society for Meta; she could not bear the idea of her growing accustomed--for want of something better--to the vicar’s wife and the pet doctor’s daughters.",dread like trouble move attach entreat think leave dread aunt influence allow pretty place only complaint want suitable society bear idea grow accustom want good vicar wife pet doctor daughter 
96,"Flora had been long desirous to effect a regular call at Abbotstoke, and it was just now that she succeeded. Mrs. Charles Wilmot’s little girl was to have a birthday feast, at which Mary, Blanche, and Aubrey were to appear. Flora went in charge of them, and as soon as she had safely deposited them, and appointed Mary to keep Aubrey out of mischief, she walked up to the Grange, not a whit daunted by the report of the very fine ladies who were astonishing the natives of Abbotstoke.",long desirous effect regular call succeed little girl have birthday feast appear go charge deposit appoint keep mischief walk whit daunt report fine lady astonish native 
97,"She was admitted, and found herself in the drawing-room, with a quick lively-looking lady, whom she perceived to be Lady Leonora, and who instantly began talking to her very civilly. Flora was never at a loss, and they got on extremely well; her ease and self-possession, without forwardness, telling much to her advantage. Meta came in, delighted to see her, but, of course, the visit resulted in no really intimate talk, though it was not without effect. Flora declared Lady Leonora Langdale to be a most charming person; and Lady Leonora, on her side, asked Meta who was that very elegant conversible girl. “Flora May,” was the delighted answer, now that the aunt had committed herself by commendation. And she did not retract it; she pronounced Flora to be something quite out of the common way, and supposed that she had had unusual advantages.",admit find draw room quick lively look lady perceive begin talk loss get ease self possession forwardness tell much advantage come delighted see course visit result intimate talk effect declare charming person side ask elegant conversible girl delighted answer aunt commit commendation retract pronounce common way suppose have unusual advantage 
98,"Mr. Rivers took care to introduce to his sister-in-law Dr. May (who would fain have avoided it), but ended by being in his turn pleased and entertained by her brilliant conversation, which she put forth for him, as her instinct showed her that she was talking to a man of high ability. A perfect gentleman she saw him to be, and making out some mutual connections far up in the family tree of the Mackenzies, she decided that the May family were an acquisition, and very good companions for her niece at present, while not yet come out. So ended the visit, with this great triumph for Meta, who had a strong belief in Aunt Leonora’s power and infallibility, and yet had not consulted her about Bellairs, nor about the school question.",take care introduce sister law avoid end turn pleased entertain brilliant conversation put instinct show talk man high ability perfect gentleman see make mutual connection family tree decide family acquisition good companion niece present come end visit great triumph have strong belief power infallibility consult school question 
99,"She had missed one Sunday’s school on account of her aunt’s visit, but the resolution made beside Margaret’s sofa had not been forgotten. She spent her Saturday afternoon in a call on Mrs. Wilmot, ending with a walk through the village; she confessed her ignorance, apologised for her blunders, and put herself under the direction which once she had fancied too strict and harsh to be followed.",miss school account aunt visit resolution make sofa forget spend afternoon call end walk village confess ignorance apologise blunder put direction fancy strict harsh follow 
100,"And on Sunday she was content to teach the stupid girls, and abstain from making much of the smooth-faced engaging set. She thought it very dull work, but she could feel that it was something not done to please herself; and whereas her father had feared she would be dull when her cousins were gone, he found her more joyous than ever.",content teach stupid girl abstain make much smooth face engage set think dull work feel do please father fear dull cousin gone find joyous 
101,"There certainly was a peculiar happiness about Margaret Rivers; her vexations were but ripples, rendering the sunny course of her life more sparkling, and each exertion in the way of goodness was productive of so much present joy that the steps of her ladder seemed, indeed, to be of diamonds.",be peculiar happiness vexation ripple rendering sunny course life sparkling exertion way goodness productive much present joy step ladder seem diamond 
102,"Her ladder--for she was, indeed, mounting upwards. She was very earnest in her Confirmation preparation, most anxious to do right and to contend with her failings; but the struggle at present was easy; and the hopes, joys, and incentives shone out more and more upon her in this blithe stage of her life.",ladder mount earnest confirmation preparation anxious do right contend failing struggle present easy hope joy incentive shine more blithe stage life
