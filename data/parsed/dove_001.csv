1,INTRODUCTION.,introduction 
2," IN sending forth this little book, I am inclined to add a few explanatory words as to the use I have made of historical personages.  The origin of the whole story was probably Freytag’s first series of pictures of German Life: probably, I say, for its first commencement was a dream, dreamt some weeks after reading that most interesting collection of sketches. The return of the squire with the tidings of the death of the two knights was vividly depicted in sleep; and, though without local habitation or name, the scene was most likely to have been a reflection from the wild scenes so lately read of.",send little book inclined add few explanatory word use make historical personage origin whole story first series picture german life say first commencement dream dreamt week read interesting collection sketche return squire tiding death knight depict sleep local habitation name scene likely reflection wild scene read 
3,"In fact, waking thoughts decided that such a catastrophe could hardly have happened anywhere but in Germany, or in Scotland; and the contrast between the cultivation in the free cities and the savagery of the independent barons made the former the more suitable region for the adventures.  The time could only be before the taming and bringing into order of the empire, when the Imperial cities were in their greatest splendour, the last free nobles in course of being reduced from their lawless liberty, and the House of Austria beginning to acquire its preponderance over the other princely families.",fact wake thought decide catastrophe happen contrast cultivation free city savagery independent baron make former suitable region adventure time taming bring order empire imperial city great splendour last free noble course reduce lawless liberty begin acquire preponderance other princely family 
4,"M. Freytag’s books, and Hegewisch’s History of Maximilian, will, I think, be found fully to bear out the picture I have tried to give of the state of things in the reign of the Emperor Friedrich III., when, for want of any other law, _Faust recht_, or fist right, ruled; _i.e._ an offended nobleman, having once sent a _Fehde-brief_ to his adversary, was thenceforth at liberty to revenge himself by a private war, in which, for the wrong inflicted, no justice was exacted.",book think find bear picture try give state thing reign want other law fist right rule offend nobleman send brief_ adversary thenceforth liberty revenge private war wrong inflict justice exact 
5,"Hegewisch remarks that the only benefit of this custom was, that the honour of subscribing a feud-brief was so highly esteemed that it induced the nobles to learn to write!  The League of St. George and the Swabian League were the means of gradually putting down this authorized condition of deadly feud.",remark only benefit custom honour subscribe feud brief esteemed induce noble learn write swabian means put authorize condition deadly feud 
6,"This was in the days of Maximilian’s youth.  He is a prince who seems to have been almost as inferior in his foreign to what he was in his domestic policy as was Queen Elizabeth.  He is chiefly familiar to us as failing to keep up his authority in Flanders after the death of Mary of Burgundy, as lingering to fulfil his engagement with Anne of Brittany till he lost her and her duchy, as incurring ridicule by his ill-managed schemes in Italy, and the vast projects that he was always forming without either means or steadiness to carry them out, by his perpetual impecuniosity and slippery dealing; and in his old age he has become rather the laughing-stock of historians.",day youth prince seem inferior foreign domestic policy familiar fail keep authority death linger fulfil engagement lose duchy incurr ridicule ill manage scheme vast project form means steadiness carry perpetual impecuniosity slippery deal old age become laugh stock historian 
7,"But there is much that is melancholy in the sight of a man endowed with genius, unbalanced by the force of character that secures success, and with an ardent nature whose intention overleapt obstacles that in practice he found insuperable.  At home Maximilian raised the Imperial power from a mere cipher to considerable weight.  We judge him as if he had been born in the purple and succeeded to a defined power like his descendants.  We forget that the head of the Holy Roman Empire had been, ever since the extinction of the Swabian line, a mere mark for ambitious princes to shoot at, with everything expected from him, and no means to do anything.  Maximilian’s own father was an avaricious, undignified old man, not until near his death Archduke of even all Austria, and with anarchy prevailing everywhere under his nominal rule.  It was in the time of Maximilian that the Empire became as compact and united a body as could be hoped of anything so unwieldy, that law was at least acknowledged, _Faust recht_ for ever abolished, and the Emperor became once more a real power.",be much melancholy sight man endow genius unbalanced force character secure success ardent nature intention overleapt obstacle practice find insuperable home raise imperial power mere cipher considerable weight judge bear purple succeed define power descendant forget head holy roman extinction swabian line mere mark ambitious prince shoot expect means do own father avaricious undignified old man death anarchy prevail nominal rule time become compact unite body hope unwieldy law acknowledge abolish emperor become real power 
8,"The man under whom all this was effected could have been no fool; yet, as he said himself, he reigned over a nation of kings, who each chose to rule for himself; and the uncertainty of supplies of men or money to be gained from them made him so often fail necessarily in his engagements, that he acquired a shiftiness and callousness to breaches of promise, which became the worst flaw in his character.  But of the fascination of his manner there can be no doubt.  Even Henry VIII.’s English ambassadors, when forced to own how little they could depend on him, and how dangerous it was to let subsidies pass through his fingers, still show themselves under a sort of enchantment of devotion to his person, and this in his old age, and when his conduct was most inexcusable and provoking.",man effect fool say reign nation king choose rule uncertainty supplies man money gain make fail engagement acquire shiftiness callousness breach promise become bad flaw character fascination manner doubt english ambassador force own little depend dangerous let subsidy pass finger show sort enchantment devotion person old age conduct inexcusable provoking 
9,"His variety of powers was wonderful.  He was learned in many languages—in all those of his empire or hereditary states, and in many besides; and he had an ardent love of books, both classical and modern.  He delighted in music, painting, architecture, and many arts of a more mechanical description; wrote treatises on all these, and on other subjects, especially gardening and gunnery.  He was the inventor of an improved lock to the arquebus, and first divined how to adapt the disposition of his troops to the use of the newly-discovered fire-arms.  And in all these things his versatile head and ready hand were personally employed, not by deputy; while coupled with so much artistic taste was a violent passion for hunting, which carried him through many hairbreadth ’scapes. “It was plain,” he used to say, “that God Almighty ruled the world, or how could things go on with a rogue like Alexander VI. at the head of the Church, and a mere huntsman like himself at the head of the Empire.”  His _bon-mots_ are numerous, all thoroughly characteristic, and showing that brilliancy in conversation must have been one of his greatest charms.  It seems as if only self-control and resolution were wanting to have made him a Charles, or an Alfred, the Great.",variety power wonderful learn many language empire hereditary state many besides have ardent love book classical modern delight music painting architecture many art mechanical description write treatise other subject gardening gunnery inventor improve lock arquebus divine adapt disposition troops use discover fire arm thing versatile head ready hand employ deputy couple much artistic taste violent passion hunting carry many hairbreadth scape plain use say rule world thing go rogue head mere huntsman head _bon mots_ numerous characteristic show brilliancy conversation great charm seem self control resolution want make great 
10,"The romance of his marriage with the heiress of Burgundy is one of the best known parts of his life.  He was scarcely two-and-twenty when he lost her, who perhaps would have given him the stability he wanted; but his tender hove for her endured through life.  It is not improbable that it was this still abiding attachment that made him slack in overcoming difficulties in the way of other contracts, and that he may have hoped that his engagement to Bianca Sforza would come to nothing, like so many others.",romance marriage heiress know part life lose give stability want tender hove endure life improbable abide attachment make slack overcome difficulty way other contract hope engagement come many other 
11,"The most curious record of him is, however, in two books, the materials for which he furnished, and whose composition and illustration he superintended, _Der Weise King_, and _Theurdank_, of both of which he is well known to be the hero.  The White, or the Wise King, it is uncertain which, is a history of his education and exploits, in prose.  Every alternate page has its engraving, showing how the Young White King obtains instruction in painting, architecture, language, and all arts and sciences, the latter including magic—which he learns of an old woman with a long-tailed demon sitting, like Mother Hubbard’s cat, on her shoulder—and astrology.  In the illustration of this study an extraordinary figure of a cross within a circle appears in the sky, which probably has some connection with his scheme of nativity, for it also appears on the breast of Ehrenhold, his constant companion in the metrical history of his career, under the name of Theurdank.",curious record book material furnish composition illustration superintend know hero wise uncertain history education exploit prose alternate page have engraving show young white obtain instruction painting architecture language art science latter include magic learn old woman long tail demon sit cat shoulder astrology illustration study extraordinary figure cross circle appear sky have connection scheme nativity appear breast constant companion metrical history career name 
12,"The poetry of _Theurdank_ was composed by Maximilian’s old writing-master, Melchior Pfinznig; but the adventures were the Kaisar’s own, communicated by himself, and he superintended the wood-cuts.  The name is explained to mean “craving glory,”—Gloriæmemor.  The Germans laugh to scorn a French translator, who rendered it “Chermerci.”  It was annotated very soon after its publication, and each exploit explained and accounted for.  It is remarkable and touching in a man who married at eighteen, and was a widower at twenty-two, that, in both books, the happy union with his lady love is placed at the end—not at the beginning of the book; and in _Theurdank_, at least, the eternal reunion is clearly meant.",poetry compose old writing master adventure own communicate superintend wood cut name explain mean craving glory laugh scorn french translator render annotate publication exploit explain account remarkable touch man marry widower book happy union lady love place end beginning book least eternal reunion mean 
13,"In this curious book, König Römreich, by whom every contemporary understood poor Charles of Burgundy—thus posthumously made King of Rome by Maximilian, as the only honour in his power, betroths his daughter Ehrenreich (rich in honour) to the Ritter Theurdank.  Soon after, by a most mild version of Duke Charles’s frightful end, König Römreich is seen on his back dying in a garden, and Ehrenreich (as Mary really did) despatches a ring to summon her betrothed.",curious book contemporary understand poor make only honour power betroth daughter rich honour mild version frightful end see back die garden despatch ring summon betroth 
14,"But here Theurdank returns for answer that he means first to win honour by his exploits, and sets out with his comrade, Ehrenhold, in search thereof.  Ehrenhold never appears of the smallest use to him in any of the dire adventures into which he falls, but only stands complacently by, and in effect may represent Fame, or perhaps that literary sage whom Don Quixote always supposed to be at hand to record his deeds of prowess.",return answer mean first win honour exploit set comrade search appear small use dire adventure fall stand effect represent literary sage suppose hand record deed prowess 
15,"Next we are presented with the German impersonation of Satan as a wise old magician, only with claws instead of feet, commissioning his three captains (_hauptleutern_), Fürwitz, Umfallo, and Neidelhard, to beset and ruin Theurdank.  They are interpreted as the dangers of youth, middle life, and old age—Rashness, Disaster, and Distress (or Envy).  One at a time they encounter him,—not once, but again and again; and he has ranged under each head, in entire contempt of real order of time, the perils he thinks owing to each foe.  Fürwitz most justly gets the credit of Maximilian’s perils on the steeple of Ulm, though, unfortunately, the artist has represented the daring climber as standing not much above the shoulders of Fürwitz and Ehrenhold; and although the annotation tells us that his “hinder half foot” overhung the scaffold, the danger in the print is not appalling.  Fürwitz likewise inveigles him into putting the point (_schnäbel_) of his shoe into the wheel of a mill for turning stone balls, where he certainly hardly deserved to lose nothing but the beak of his shoe.  This enemy also brings him into numerous unpleasant predicaments on precipices, where he hangs by one hand; while the chamois stand delighted on every available peak, Fürwitz grins malevolently, and Ehrenhold stands pointing at him over his shoulder.  Time and place are given in the notes for all these escapes.  After some twenty adventures Fürwitz is beaten off, and Umfallo tries his powers.  Here the misadventures do not involve so much folly on the hero’s part—though, to be sure, he ventures into a lion’s den unarmed, and has to beat off the inmates with a shovel.  But the other adventures are more rational.  He catches a jester—of admirably foolish expression—putting a match to a powder-magazine; he is wonderfully preserved in mountain avalanches and hurricanes; reins up his horse on the verge of an abyss; falls through ice in Holland and shows nothing but his head above it; cures himself of a fever by draughts of water, to the great disgust of his physicians, and escapes a fire bursting out of a tall stove.",present german impersonation wise old magician claw foot commission captain beset ruin interpret danger youth middle life old age rashness disaster distress envy time encounter rang head entire contempt real order time peril think ow foe get credit peril steeple artist represent dare climber stand shoulder annotation tell hinder half foot overh scaffold danger print appalling inveigle put point _schnäbel_ shoe wheel mill turn stone ball deserve lose beak shoe enemy bring numerous unpleasant predicament precipice hang hand chamois stand delight available peak grin stand point shoulder time place give note escape adventure beat try power misadventure involve much folly hero part sure venture lion dan unarmed have beat inmate shovel other adventure rational catch jester foolish expression put match powder magazine preserve mountain avalanche hurricane rein horse verge abyss fall ice show head cure fever draught water great disgust physician escape fire burst tall stove 
16,"Neidelhard brings his real battles and perils.  From this last he is in danger of shipwreck, of assassination, of poison, in single combat, or in battle; tumults of the people beset him; he is imprisoned as at Ghent. But finally Neidelhard is beaten back; and the hero is presented to Ehrenreich.  Ehrenhold recounts his triumphs, and accuses the three captains.  One is hung, another beheaded, the third thrown headlong from a tower, and a guardian angel then summons Theurdank to his union with his Queen.  No doubt this reunion was the life-dream of the harassed, busy, inconsistent man, who flashed through the turmoils of the early sixteenth century.",bring real battle peril last danger shipwreck assassination poison single combat battle tumult person beset imprison beat hero present recount triumph accuse captain hung behead third throw tower guardian angel summons union doubt reunion life dream harass busy inconsistent man flash turmoil early sixteenth century 
17,"The adventures of Maximilian which have been adverted to in the story are all to be found in Theurdank, and in his early life he was probably the brilliant eager person we have tried in some degree to describe.  In his latter years it is well known that he was much struck by Luther’s arguments; and, indeed, he had long been conscious of need of Church reform, though his plans took the grotesque form of getting himself made Pope, and taking all into his own hands.",adventure advert story find early life brilliant eager person try degree describe latter year know strike argument conscious need reform plan take grotesque form get make take own hand 
18,"Perhaps it was unwise to have ever so faintly sketched Ebbo’s career through the ensuing troubles; but the history of the star and of the spark in the stubble seemed to need completion; and the working out of the character of the survivor was unfinished till his course had been thought over from the dawn of the Wittenberg teaching, which must have seemed no novelty to an heir of the doctrine of Tauler, and of the veritably Catholic divines of old times.  The idea is of the supposed course of a thoughtful, refined, conscientious man through the earlier times of the Reformation, glad of the hope of cleansing the Church, but hoping to cleanse, not to break away from her—a hope that Luther himself long cherished, and which was not entirely frustrated till the re-assembly at Trent in the next generation.  Justice has never been done to the men who feared to loose their hold on the Church Catholic as the one body to which the promises were made.  Their loyalty has been treated as blindness, timidity, or superstition; but that there were many such persons, and those among the very highest minds of their time, no one can have any doubt after reading such lives as those of Friedrich the Wise of Saxony, of Erasmus, of Vittoria Colonna, or of Cardinal Giustiniani.",unwise sketch career ensue trouble history star spark stubble seem need completion working character survivor unfinished course think dawn teaching seem novelty heir doctrine catholic divine old time idea suppose course thoughtful refined conscientious man early time glad hope cleanse hope cleanse break hope cherish frustrate re-assembly next generation do man fear lose hold body promise make loyalty treat blindness timidity superstition be many such person high mind time have doubt read such life
