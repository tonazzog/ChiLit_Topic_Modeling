12,"“Fortunate I tied my bag to the string of my cloak, wasn’t it?” remarked the Wallypug, when they had gone. “I should have lost it else. Oh, look!

13,"“O—o—o—h!” he continued delightedly, as it stopped, caught in the mouth of the carpet-bag which, attached to the cord of his Majesty’s cloak, dangled down the shute. “Why, it’s my crown! They must have thought that I wanted it, and sent it down after me. How very kind of them. Wasn’t it?”",continue stop catch mouth carpet bag attach cord cloak dangle shute crown think want send kind

20,"He soon caught sight of us dangling at the end of our rods, and calling out “Halt!” in a loud voice, he pulled at the rope as a sign that they were to stop. This signal was passed along by the others, and the Cockatoo, who was attached to the rope in a very uncomfortable manner, gave a loud “squ-a-a-k” as the sudden jerk caused it to tighten about her neck.",catch sight dangle end rod call halt loud voice pull rope sign stop signal pass other attach rope uncomfortable manner give loud squ k sudden jerk cause tighten neck

29,"We watched his endeavors with considerable anxiety, for if he did succeed in getting on to the bank, it would be an easy matter for him to get at us, by means of the bridge. The rope, however, by which he was attached to the Sister-in-Law was not sufficiently long to enable him to do this, and while he was unfastening it there was a sudden cry in the direction of the tunnel, and a moment afterwards, screaming, kicking, and struggling, the whole party rapidly disappeared down the shute.",watch endeavor considerable anxiety succeed get bank easy matter get means bridge rope attach long enable do unfasten be sudden cry direction tunnel moment scream kick struggle whole party disappear shute

62,"The little blue people immediately jumped up and led the way to where behind a clump of curious blue trees the quaintest little boat you could possibly imagine was moored against the bank. A blue lake stretched as far as the eye could reach, and a number of little islands were dotted about it. On one, a little larger than the rest, a quaint little blue pagoda could be seen.",little blue person jump lead way clump curious blue tree quaintest little boat imagine moor bank blue lake stretch eye reach number little island dot little large rest quaint little blue pagoda see
