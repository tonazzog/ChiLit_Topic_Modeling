3,"Our examination of the little valley proved to be altogether most satisfactory.  We found in it not only similar trees to those we had already seen in our own valley, but also one or two others of a different species.  We had also the satisfaction of discovering a peculiar vegetable, which Jack concluded must certainly be that of which he had read as being very common among the South Sea islanders, and which was named _taro_.  Also we found a large supply of yams, and another root like a potato in appearance.  As these were all quite new to us, we regarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast on an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the necessaries of life.  Long afterwards we found out that this island of ours was no better in these respects than thousands of other islands in those seas. Indeed, many of them were much richer and more productive; but that did not render us the less grateful for our present good fortune.  We each put one of these roots in our pocket, intending to use them for our supper; of which more hereafter.  We also saw many beautiful birds here, and traces of some four-footed animal again.  Meanwhile the sun began to descend, so we returned to the shore, and pushed on round the spouting rocks into the next valley.  This was that valley of which I have spoken as running across the entire island.  It was by far the largest and most beautiful that we had yet looked upon.  Here were trees of every shape and size and hue which it is possible to conceive of, many of which we had not seen in the other valleys; for, the stream in this valley being larger, and the mould much richer than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was clothed with a more luxuriant growth of trees and plants.  Some trees were dark glossy green, others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting well with those of a pale light green, which were everywhere abundant.  Among these we recognised the broad dark heads of the bread-fruit, with its golden fruit; the pure, silvery foliage of the candle-nut, and several species which bore a strong resemblance to the pine; while here and there, in groups and in single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa- nut palms, spreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above all the rest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants keeping guard over these luxuriant forests.  Oh! it was a most enchanting scene, and I thanked God for having created such delightful spots for the use of man.",examination little valley prove satisfactory find similar tree see own valley other different species have satisfaction discover peculiar vegetable conclude read common islander name _taro_ find large supply yam root potato appearance new regard lot fortunate one cast island prolific store necessary life find island good respect thousand other island sea many richer productive render grateful present good fortune put root pocket intend use supper see many beautiful bird trace foot animal sun begin descend return shore push spout rock next valley valley speak run entire island large beautiful look tree shape size hue possible conceive many see other valley stream valley large mould richer cloth luxuriant growth tree plant tree dark glossy green other rich warm hue contrast pale light green abundant recognise broad dark head bread fruit golden fruit pure silvery foliage candle nut several species bear strong resemblance pine group single tree rise tall form cocoa nut palm spread wave graceful plume high rest superior race stately giant keep guard luxuriant forest enchanting scene thank create such delightful spot use man 
4,"Now, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack uttered an exclamation of surprise, and, pointing to an object a little to one side of us, said,--",gaze silent admiration utter exclamation surprise point object little side say 
5,"""That's a banian-tree.""",banian tree 
6,"""And what's a banian-tree?"" inquired Peterkin, as we walked towards it.",banian tree inquire walk 
7,"""A very curious one, as you shall see presently,"" replied Jack.  ""It is called the _aoa_ here, if I recollect rightly, and has a wonderful peculiarity about it.  What an enormous one it is, to be sure.""",curious one see reply call recollect have wonderful peculiarity enormous one sure 
8,"""_It_!"" repeated Peterkin; ""why, there are dozens of banians here!  What do you mean by talking bad grammar?  Is your philosophy deserting you, Jack?""",repeat be dozen banian mean talk bad grammar philosophy desert 
9,"""There is but one tree here of this kind,"" returned Jack, ""as you will perceive if you will examine it.""  And, sure enough, we did find that what we had supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.  Its bark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the leaves being lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful pea-green.  But the wonderful thing about it was, that the branches, which grew out from the stem horizontally, sent down long shoots or fibres to the ground, which, taking root, had themselves become trees, and were covered with bark like the tree itself.  Many of these fibres had descended from the branches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural pillars, some of which were so large and strong, that it was not easy at first to distinguish the offspring from the parent stem.  The fibres were of all sizes and in all states of advancement, from the pillars we have just mentioned to small cords which hung down and were about to take root, and thin brown threads still far from the ground, which swayed about with every motion of wind.  In short, it seemed to us that, if there were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at length cover the whole island.",be tree kind return perceive examine find suppose forest tree reality bark light colour have shine appearance leave lance shape small beautiful pea-green wonderful thing branch grow stem send long shoot fibre ground take root become tree cover bark tree many fibre descend branch various distance support natural pillar large strong easy first distinguish offspring parent stem fibre size state advancement pillar mention small cord hang about take root thin brown thread ground sway motion wind short seem be space afford single tree length cover whole island 
10,"Shortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, which, as its peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely useful to us, merits description.  It was a splendid chestnut, but its proper name Jack did not know.  However, there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of which we put in our pockets.  But its stem was the wonderful part of it. It rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was not of great thickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably slender for the size of the tree; but, to make up for this, there were four or five wonderful projections in this stem, which I cannot better describe than by asking the reader to suppose that five planks of two inches thick and three feet broad had been placed round the trunk of the tree, with their _edges_ closely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and that these planks bad been covered over with the bark of the tree and incorporated with it.  In short, they were just natural buttresses, without which the stem could not have supported its heavy and umbrageous top.  We found these chestnuts to be very numerous.  They grew chiefly on the banks of the stream, and were of all sizes.",come remarkable tree peculiar formation prove useful merit description splendid chestnut proper name know be quantity fine nut put pocket stem wonderful part rise foot branch great thickness contrary slender size tree make be wonderful projection stem describe ask reader suppose plank inch thick foot broad place trunk tree _edges_ fix ground branch plank cover bark tree incorporate short natural buttress stem support heavy umbrageous top find chestnut numerous grow bank stream size 
11,"While we were examining a small tree of this kind, Jack chipped a piece off a buttress with his axe, and found the wood to be firm and easily cut.  He then struck the axe into it with all his force, and very soon split it off close to the tree, first, however, having cut it across transversely above and below.  By this means he satisfied himself that we could now obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size and thickness that we desired; which was a very great discovery indeed, perhaps the most important we had yet made.",examine small tree kind chip piece buttress axe find wood firm cut strike axe force split tree cut mean satisfy obtain short plank ready sawn size thickness desire great discovery important make 
12,"We now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp near the beach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome in the forest.  On our way we could not help admiring the birds which flew and chirped around us.  Among them we observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a green body, a blue head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful turtledoves, and several flocks of wood-pigeons.  The hues of many of these birds were extremely vivid,--bright green, blue, and scarlet, being the prevailing tints.  We made several attempts throughout the day to bring down one of these, both with the bow and the sling,--not for mere sport, but to ascertain whether they were good for food.  But we invariably missed, although once or twice we were very near hitting.  As evening drew on, however, a flock of pigeons flew past.  I slung a stone into the midst of them at a venture, and had the good fortune to kill one.  We were startled, soon after, by a loud whistling noise above our heads; and on looking up, saw a flock of wild ducks making for the coast. We watched these, and, observing where they alighted, followed them up until we came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two hundred yards long, imbosomed in verdant trees.  Its placid surface, which reflected every leaf and stem, as if in a mirror, was covered with various species of wild ducks, feeding among the sedges and broad-leaved water-plants which floated on it, while numerous birds like water-hens ran to and fro most busily on its margin.  These all with one accord flew tumultuously away the instant we made our appearance.  While walking along the margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort we could not tell.",wend way coast intend encamp beach find mosquitoe troublesome forest way help admire bird fly chirp observe pretty kind paroquet green body blue head red breast few beautiful turtledove several flock wood pigeon hue many bird vivid bright green blue scarlet prevail tint make several attempt day bring bow sling mere sport ascertain good food miss hit evening draw flock pigeon fly sling stone midst venture have good fortune kill startle loud whistling noise head look see flock wild duck make coast watch observe alight follow come lovely blue lake more yard long imbosom verdant tree placid surface reflect leaf stem mirror cover various species wild duck feed sedge broad leave water plant float numerous bird water hen run margin accord fly instant make appearance walk margin observe fish water sort tell 
13,"Now, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a little out of our way to see if we could procure one of those ducks; so, directing Peterkin to go straight to the shore and kindle a fire, we separated, promising to rejoin him speedily.  But we did not find the ducks, although we made a diligent search for half an hour.  We were about to retrace our steps, when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights that we had yet beheld.",near shore say go little way see procure duck direct go shore kindle fire separate promise rejoin find duck make diligent search hour about retrace step arrest strangest sight beheld 
14,"Just in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew a superb tree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on the island.  Its trunk was at least five feet in diameter, with a smooth gray bark; above this the spreading branches were clothed with light green leaves, amid which were clusters of bright yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh down the boughs with their great weight.  This fruit seemed to be of the plum species, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the magnum bonum plum.  The ground at the foot of this tree was thickly strewn with the fallen fruit, in the midst of which lay sleeping, in every possible attitude, at least twenty hogs of all ages and sizes, apparently quite surfeited with a recent banquet.",front distance yard grow superb tree large see island trunk least foot diameter smooth gray bark spread branch cloth light green leave cluster bright yellow fruit numerous weigh bough great weight fruit seem plum species oblong form good deal large magnum bonum plum ground foot tree strewn fall fruit midst lay sleeping possible attitude least hog age size surfeit recent banquet 
15,"Jack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at these coarse, fat, ill-looking animals, while they lay groaning and snoring heavily amid the remains of their supper.",scarce restrain laughter gaze coarse fat ill look animal lay groan snore remains supper 
16,"""Now, Ralph,"" said Jack, in a low whisper, ""put a stone in your sling,--a good big one,--and let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you. I'll try to put an arrow into yon little pig.""",say low whisper put stone sling good big one let fly fat fellow back try put arrow little pig 
17,"""Don't you think we had better put them up first?"" I whispered; ""it seems cruel to kill them while asleep.""",think have good put whisper seem cruel kill asleep 
18,"""If I wanted _sport_, Ralph, I would certainly set them up; but as we only want _pork_, we'll let them lie.  Besides, we're not sure of killing them; so, fire away.""",want set want _pork_ let lie sure kill fire 
19,"Thus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it went bang against the hog's flank as if against the head of a drum; but it had no other effect than that of causing the animal to start to its feet, with a frightful yell of surprise, and scamper away.  At the same instant Jack's bow twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by the ear.",admonish sling stone good aim go bang hog flank head drum have other effect cause animal start foot frightful yell surprise scamper same instant bow twange arrow pinn little pig ground ear 
20,"""I've missed, after all,"" cried Jack, darting forward with uplifted axe, while the little pig uttered a loud squeal, tore the arrow from the ground, and ran away with it, along with the whole drove, into the bushes and disappeared, though we heard them screaming long afterwards in the distance.",miss cry dart uplift axe little pig utter loud squeal tore arrow ground run whole drive bush disappear hear scream distance 
21,"""That's very provoking, now,"" said Jack, rubbing the point of his nose.",provoking say rub point nose 
22,"""Very,"" I replied, stroking my chin.",reply stroke chin 
23,"""Well, we must make haste and rejoin Peterkin,"" said Jack.  ""It's getting late.""  And, without further remark, we threaded our way quickly through the woods towards the shore.",make haste rejoin say get late further remark thread way wood shore 
24,"When we reached it, we found wood laid out, the fire lighted and beginning to kindle up, with other signs of preparation for our encampment, but Peterkin was nowhere to be found.  We wondered very much at this; but Jack suggested that he might have gone to fetch water; so he gave a shout to let him know that we had arrived, and sat down upon a rock, while I threw off my jacket and seized the axe, intending to split up one or two billets of wood.  But I had scarce moved from the spot when, in the distance, we heard a most appalling shriek, which was followed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs, and a loud ""hurrah!""",reach find wood lay fire light begin kindle other sign preparation encampment find wonder suggest go fetch water give shout let know arrive sit rock throw jacket seize axe intend split billet wood scarce move spot distance hear appalling shriek follow chorus yell hog loud hurrah

26,"""When Greek meets Greek,"" said Jack, soliloquizing, ""then comes the tug of--""",meet say soliloquize come tug 
27,"""Hurrah!"" shouted Peterkin in the distance.",shout distance 
28,"We turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came, and soon descried Peterkin walking along the beach towards us with a little pig transfixed on the end of his long spear!",turn direction sound come descry walk beach little pig transfixe end long spear 
29,"""Well done, my boy!"" exclaimed Jack, slapping him on the shoulder when he came up, ""you're the best shot amongst us.""",do boy exclaim slap shoulder come good shot 
30,"""Look here Jack!"" cried Peterkin, as he disengaged the animal from his spear.  ""Do you recognise that hole?"" said he, pointing to the pig's ear; ""and are you familiar with this arrow, eh?""",look cry disengage animal spear recognise hole say point pig ear familiar arrow 
31,"""Well, I declare!"" said Jack.",declare say 
32,"""Of course you do,"" interrupted Peterkin; ""but, pray, restrain your declarations at this time, and let's have supper, for I'm uncommonly hungry, I can tell you; and it's no joke to charge a whole herd of swine with their great-grandmother bristling like a giant porcupine at the head of them!""",course interrupt pray restrain declaration time let have supper hungry tell joke charge whole herd swine great grandmother bristle giant porcupine head 
33,"We now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display of viands we made, when all was laid out on a flat rock in the light of the blazing fire.  There was, first of all, the little pig; then there was the taro- root, and the yam, and the potato, and six plums; and, lastly, the wood- pigeon.  To these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had cut from a little patch of that plant which he had found not long after separating from us; ""and,"" said he, ""the patch was somewhat in a square form, which convinces me it must have been planted by man.""",set prepare supper good display viand make lay flat rock light blaze fire be first little pig be taro- root yam potato plum wood pigeon add bit sugar cane cut little patch plant find separate say patch square form convince plant man 
34,"""Very likely,"" replied Jack.  ""From all we have seen, I'm inclined to think that some of the savages must have dwelt here long ago.""",likely reply see inclined think savage dwele 
35,"We found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we were to cook the pig.  None of us had ever cut up one before, and we did not know exactly how to begin; besides, we had nothing but the axe to do it with, our knife having been forgotten.  At last Jack started up and said,--",find small difficulty make mind cook pig cut know begin have axe do knife forget last start say 
36,"""Don't let us waste more time talking about it, boys.  Hold it up, Peterkin.  There, lay the hind leg on this block of wood, so;"" and he cut it off, with a large portion of the haunch, at a single blow of the axe. ""Now the other,--that's it.""  And having thus cut off the two hind legs, he made several deep gashes in them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick through each, and stuck them up before the blaze to roast.  The wood-pigeon was then split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water, and treated in a similar manner.  While these were cooking, we scraped a hole in the sand and ashes under the fire, into which we put our vegetables, and covered them up.",let waste more time talk boy hold lay hind leg block wood cut large portion haunch single blow axe other cut hind leg make several deep gashe thrust sharp point stick stick blaze roast wood pigeon split open flat wash clean salt water treat similar manner cook scrape hole sand ash fire put vegetable cover 
37,"The taro-root was of an oval shape, about ten inches long and four or five thick.  It was of a mottled-gray colour, and had a thick rind.  We found it somewhat like an Irish potato, and exceedingly good.  The yam was roundish, and had a rough brown skin.  It was very sweet and well- flavoured.  The potato, we were surprised to find, was quite sweet and exceedingly palatable, as also were the plums; and, indeed, the pork and pigeon too, when we came to taste them.  Altogether this was decidedly the most luxurious supper we had enjoyed for many a day; and Jack said it was out-of-sight better than we ever got on board ship; and Peterkin said he feared that if we should remain long on the island he would infallibly become a glutton or an epicure: whereat Jack remarked that he need not fear that, for he was _both_ already!  And so, having eaten our fill, not forgetting to finish off with a plum, we laid ourselves comfortably down to sleep upon a couch of branches under the overhanging ledge of a coral rock.",taro root oval shape inch long thick mottled gray colour have thick rind find irish potato good yam roundish have rough brown skin sweet flavoure potato surprise find sweet palatable plum pork pigeon come taste luxurious supper enjoy day say sight good get board ship say fear remain island become glutton epicure remark fear eat fill forget finish plum lay sleep couch branch overhang ledge coral rock
