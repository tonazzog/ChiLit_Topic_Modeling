4,"That night when Eric returned to No. 7, full of grief, and weighed down with the sense of desolation and mystery, the other boys were silent from sympathy in his sorrow. Duncan and Llewellyn both knew and loved Russell themselves, and they were awestruck to hear of his death; they asked some of the particulars, but Eric was not calm enough to tell them that evening. The one sense of infinite loss agitated him, and he indulged his paroxysms of emotion unrestrained, yet silently. Reader, if ever the life has been cut short which you most dearly loved, if ever you have been made to feel absolutely lonely in the world, then, and then only, will you appreciate the depth of his affliction.",night return no. full grief weigh sense desolation mystery other boy silent sympathy sorrow know love awestruck hear death ask particular calm tell evening sense infinite loss agitate indulge paroxysm emotion unrestrained reader life cut short love make feel lonely world appreciate depth affliction 
5,"But, like all affliction, it purified and sanctified. To Eric, as he rested his aching head on a pillow wet with tears, and vainly sought for the sleep whose blessing he had never learned to prize before, how odious seemed all the vice which he had seen and partaken in since he became an inmate of that little room. How his soul revolted with infinite disgust from the language which he had heard, and the open glorying in sin of which he had so often been a witness. The stain and the shame of sin fell heavier than ever on his heart; it rode on his breast like a nightmare; it haunted his fancy with visions of guilty memory, and shapes of horrible regret. The ghosts of buried misdoings, which he had thought long lost in the mists of recollection, started up menacingly from their forgotten graves, and made him shrink with a sense of their awful reality. Behind him, like a wilderness, lay years which the locust had eaten; the intrusted hours which had passed away, and been reckoned to him as they past.",affliction purify sanctify rest ach head pillow wet tear seek sleep blessing learn prize odious seem vice see partake become inmate little room soul revolt infinite disgust language hear open glorying sin witness stain shame sin fall heavy heart ride breast nightmare haunt fancy vision guilty memory shape horrible regret ghost bury misdoing think lose mist recollection start forgotten grave make shrink sense awful reality wilderness lay year locust eat intrust hour pass reckon past 
6,"And the thought of Russell mingled with all--Russell, as he fondly imagined him now, glorified with the glory of heaven, crowned, and in white robes, and with a palm in his hand. Yes, he had walked and talked with one of the Holy Ones. Had Edwin's death, quenched his human affections, and altered his human heart? If not, might not he be there even now, leaning over his friend with the beauty of his invisible presence? The thought startled him, and seemed to give an awful lustre to the moonbeam which fell into the room. No; he could not endure such a presence now, with his weak conscience and corrupted heart; and Eric hid his head under the clothes, and shut his eyes.",thought mingle imagine glorify glory heaven crown white robe palm hand walk talk holy have death quench human affection alter human heart lean friend beauty invisible presence thought startle seem give awful lustre moonbeam fall room endure presence weak conscience corrupt heart hide head clothes shut eye 
7,"Once more the pang of separation entered like iron into his soul. Should he ever meet Russell again? What if _he_ had died instead of Edwin, where would he have been? ""Oh, no! no!"" he murmured aloud, as the terrible thought came over him of his own utter unfitness for death, and the possibility that he might never, never again hear the beloved accents, or gaze on the cherished countenance of his school friend.",pang separation enter iron soul meet die murmure terrible thought come own utter unfitness death possibility hear beloved accent gaze cherish countenance school friend 
8,"In this tumult of accusing thoughts he fell asleep; but that night the dew of blessing did not fall for him on the fields of sleep. He was frightened by unbidden dreams, in all of which his conscience obtruded on him his sinfulness, and his affection called up the haunting lineaments of the dear dead face. He was wandering down a path, at the end of which Russell stood with open arms inviting him earnestly to join him there; he saw his bright ingenuous smile, and heard, as of old, his joyous words, and he hastened to meet him; when suddenly the boy-figure disappeared, and in its place he saw the stern brow, and gleaming garments, and drawn flaming sword of the Avenger. And then he was in a great wood alone, and wandering, when the well-known voice called his name, and entreated him to turn from that evil place; and he longed to turn,--but, whenever he tried, ghostly hands seemed to wave him back again, and irresistible cords to drag him into the dark forest, amid the sound of mocking laughs. Then he was sinking, sinking, sinking into a gulf, deep and darker even than the inner darkness of a sin-desolated heart; sinking, helplessly, hopelessly, everlastingly; while far away, like a star, stood the loved figure in light infinitely above him, and with pleading hands implored his deliverance, but could not prevail; and Eric was still sinking, sinking, infinitely, when the agony awoke him with a violent start and stifled scream.",tumult accuse thought fall asleep night dew blessing fall field sleep frighten unbidden dream conscience obtrude sinfulness affection call haunting lineament dear dead face wonder path end stand open arm invite join see bright ingenuous smile hear old joyous word hasten meet boy figure disappear place see stern brow gleam garment draw flame sword great wood wonder know voice call name entreat turn evil place long turn try ghostly hand seem wave irresistible cord drag dark forest sound mocking laugh sink sink sink gulf deep dark inner darkness sin desolate heart sink star stand love figure light plead hand implore deliverance prevail sink sink agony awoke violent start stifle scream 
9,"He could sleep no longer. Whenever he closed his eyes he saw the pale, dead, holy features of Edwin, and at last he fancied that he was praying beside his corpse, praying to be more like _him_, who lay there so white and calm; sorrowing beside it, sorrowing that he had so often rejected his kind warnings, and pained his affectionate heart. So Eric began again to make good resolutions about all his future life. Ah! how often he had done so before, and how often they had failed. He had not yet learned the lesson which David learned by sad experience; ""Then I said, it is mine own infirmity, _but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High_.""",sleep close eye see pale dead holy feature last fancy pray corpse pray lay white calm sorrow sorrow reject kind warning pain affectionate heart begin make good resolution future life do fail learn lesson learn sad experience say own infirmity remember year right hand most 
10,"That, too, was an eventful night for Montagu. He had grown of late far more thoughtful than before; under Edwin's influence he had been laying aside, one by one, the careless sins of school life, and his tone was nobler and manlier than it had ever been. Montagu had never known or heard much about godliness; his father, a gentleman, a scholar, and a man of the world, had trained him in the principles of refinement and good taste, and given him a high standard of conventional honor; but he passed through life lightly, and had taught his son to do the same. Possessed of an ample fortune, which Montagu was to inherit, he troubled himself with none of the deep mysteries of life, and",eventful night grow late thoughtful influence lay careless sin school life tone noble manly know hear much godliness father gentleman scholar man world train principle refinement good taste give high standard conventional honor pass life teach son do same possess ample fortune inherit trouble deep mystery life

Hitherto, to be well dressed, handsome, agreeable, rich, and popular, had been to him a realised ideal of life; but now he awoke to higher and worthier aims; and once, when Russell, whose intelligent interest in his work exceeded that of any other boy, had pointed out to him that solemn question of Euripides--",listen deep eagerness strain dress handsome agreeable rich popular realise ideal life awoke high worthier aim intelligent interest work exceed other boy point solemn question

17,"The holidays were approaching. Eric, to escape as much, as possible from his sorrow, plunged into the excitement of working for the examination, and rapidly made up for lost ground. He now spent most of his time with the best of his friends, particularly Montagu, Owen, and Upton; for Upton, like himself, had been much sobered by sorrow at their loss. This time he came out _second_ in his form, and gained more than one prize. This was his first glimpse of real delight since Russell's death; and when the prize-day came, and he stood with his companions in the flower-decorated room, and went up amid universal applause to take his prize-books, and receive a few words of compliment from the governor who took the chair, he felt almost happy, and keenly entered into the pleasure which his success caused, as well as into the honors won by his friends. One outward sign only remained of his late bereavement--his mourning dress. All the prize-boys wore rosebuds or lilies of the valley in their button-holes on the occasion, but on this day Eric would not wear them. Little Wright, who was a great friend of theirs, had brought some as a present both to Eric and Montagu, as they stood together on the prize-day morning; they took them with thanks, and, as their eyes met, they understood each other's thoughts.",holiday approach escape much possible sorrow plunge excitement work examination make lose ground spend most time good friend sober sorrow loss time come form gain more prize first glimpse real delight death prize day come stand companion flower decorate room go universal applause take prize book receive few word compliment governor take chair feel happy enter pleasure success cause honor win friend outward sign remain late bereavement mourn dress prize boy wear rosebud lilie valley button hole occasion day wear little great friend bring present stand prize day morning take thanks eye meet understand other thought

31,"The next morning the great piles of corded boxes which crowded the passage were put on the coach, and the boys, gladly leaving the deserted building, drove in every sort of vehicle to the steamer. What joyous triumphant mornings those were! How the heart exulted and bounded with, the sense of life and pleasure, and how universal was the gladness and good humor of every one. Never were voyages so merry as those of the steamer that day, and even the ""good-byes"" that had to be said at Southpool were lightly borne. From thence the boys quickly scattered to the different railways, and the numbers of those who were travelling together got thinner and thinner as the distance increased. Wright and one or two others went nearly all the way with Eric, and when he got down at the little roadside station, from whence started the branch rail to Ayrton, he bade them merry and affectionate farewell. The branch train soon started, and in another hour he would be at Fairholm.",next morning great pile cord box crowd passage put coach boy leave desert building drive sort vehicle steamer joyous triumphant morning heart exult bound sense life pleasure universal gladness good humor one voyage merry steamer day good by have say borne boy scatter different railway number travel get thin thin distance increase other go way get little roadside station whence start branch rail bid merry affectionate farewell branch train start hour 
32,"It was not till then that his home feelings woke in all their intensity. He had not been there for a year. At Roslyn the summer holidays were nine weeks, and the holidays at Christmas and Easter were short, so that it had not been worth while to travel so far as Fairholm, and Eric had spent his Christmas with friends in another part of the island. But now he was once more to see dear Fairholm, and his aunt, his cousin Fanny, and above all, his little brother. His heart was beating fast with joy, and his eyes sparkling with pleasure and excitement. As he thrust his head out of the window, each well-remembered landmark gave him the delicious sensation of meeting again an old friend. ""Ah! there's the white bridge, and there's the canal, and the stile; and _there_ runs the river, and there's Velvet Lawn. Hurrah! here we are."" And springing out of the train before it had well stopped, he had shaken hands heartily with the old coachman, who was expecting him, and jumped up into the carriage in a moment.",home feeling wake intensity year summer holiday week holiday short worth travel spend friend part island more see dear aunt cousin little brother heart beat joy eye sparkling pleasure excitement thrust head window remember landmark give delicious sensation meet old friend be white bridge be canal stile run river be spring train stop shake hand old coachman expect jump carriage moment 
33,"Through the lanes he knew so well, by whose hedgerows he had so often plucked sorrel and wild roses; past the old church with its sleeping churchyard; through, the quiet village, where every ten yards he met old acquaintances who looked pleased to see him, and whom he greeted with glad smiles and nods of recognition; past the Latin school, from which came murmurs and voices as of yore (what a man he felt himself now by comparison!);--by the old Roman camp, where he had imagined such heroic things when he was a child; through all the scenes so rich with the memories and associations of his happy childhood, they flew along; and now they had entered the avenue, and Eric was painfully on the look-out.",lane know hedgerow pluck sorrel wild rose old church sleeping churchyard quiet village yard meet old acquaintance look pleased see greet glad smile nod recognition latin school come murmur voice man feel comparison old roman camp imagine such heroic thing child scene rich memory association happy childhood fly enter avenue look 
34,"Yes! there they were all three--Mrs. Trevor, and Fanny, and Vernon, on the mound at the end of the avenue; and the younger ones ran to meet him.

And Vernon quite returned the admiration as he saw the healthy glow of Eric's features, and the strong graceful development of his limbs.",tall grow look say gaze boy brother proud return admiration see healthy glow feature strong graceful development limb 
36,"And so they quickly joined Mrs. Trevor, who embraced her nephew with a mother's love: and, amid all that nameless questioning of delightful trifles, that ""blossoming vein"" of household talk, which gives such an incommunicable charm to the revisiting of home, they all three turned into the house, where Eric, hungry with his travels, did ample justice to the ""jolly spread"" prepared for him, luxurious beyond anything he had seen for his last year at school. When he and Vernon went up to their room at night--the same little room in which they slept on the night when they first had met--they marked their heights on the door again, which showed Eric that in the last year he had grown two inches, a fact which he pointed out to Vernon with no little exultation. And then they went to bed, and to a sleep over which brooded the indefinite sensation of a great unknown joy;--that rare heavenly sleep which only comes once or twice or thrice in life, on occasions such as this.",join embrace nephew mother love nameless question delightful trifle blossoming vein household talk give incommunicable charm revisiting home turn house hungry travel do ample justice jolly spread prepare luxurious see last year school go room night same little room sleep night meet mark height door show last year grow inch fact point little exultation go bed sleep brood indefinite sensation great unknown joy rare heavenly sleep come thrice life occasion such 
37,"He was up early next morning, and, opening his window, leaned out with his hands among the green vine-leaves which encircled it. The garden looked beautiful as ever, and he promised himself an early enjoyment of those currants which hung in ruby clusters over the walls. Everything was bathed in the dewy balm of summer morning, and he felt very happy as, with his little spaniel frisking round him, he visited the great Newfoundland in his kennel, and his old pet the pony in the stable. He had barely finished his rounds when breakfast was ready, and he once more met the home-circle from which he had been separated for a year. And yet over all his happiness hung a sense of change and half melancholy; they were not changed but _he_ was changed. Mrs. Trevor, and Fanny, and Vernon were the same as ever, but over _him_, had come an alteration of feeling and circumstance; an unknown or half-known _something_ which cast a shadow between them and him, and sometimes made him half shrink and start as he met their loving looks.

38,"By that mail he wrote to his father and mother an account of Russell's death, and he felt that they would guess why the letter was so blurred. ""But,"" he wrote, ""I have some friends still; especially Mr. Rose among the masters, and Monty and Upton among the boys. Monty you know; he is more like Edwin than any other boy, and I like him very much. You didn't know Upton, but I am a great deal with him, though he is much older than I am.

Poor Edwin's death opened my eyes to a good many things, and now I'd give all I have never to have taught or encouraged you in wrong things.

44,"Eric folded the letter sadly, and put it into his pocket; he didn't often show them his school letters, because, like this one, they often contained allusions to things which he did not like his aunt to know. The thought of Upton's leaving him made him quite unhappy, and he wrote him a long letter by that post, indignantly denying the supposition that his friendship had ever done him anything but good.",fold letter put pocket show school letter one contain allusion thing like aunt know thought leave make unhappy write long letter post deny supposition friendship do good 
45,"The postscript about Vernon suggested a thought that had often been in his mind. He could not but shudder in himself, when he thought of that bright little brother of his being initiated in the mysteries of evil which he himself had learnt, and sinking like himself into slow degeneracy of heart and life. It puzzled and perplexed him, and at last he determined to open his heart, partially at least, in a letter to Mr. Rose. The master fully understood his doubts, and wrote him the following reply:--",postscript suggest thought mind shudder think bright little brother initiate mystery evil learn sink slow degeneracy heart life puzzle perplex last determine open heart least letter master understand doubt write follow reply

47,"""You mean, no doubt, that, from your own experience, you fear that Vernon will hear at school many things which will shock his modesty, and much language which is evil and blasphemous; you fear that he will meet with many bad examples, and learn to look on God and godliness in a way far different from that to which he has been accustomed at home. You fear, in short, that he must pass through the same painful temptations to which you have yourself been subjected; to which, perhaps, you have even succumbed.",mean doubt own experience fear hear school many thing shock modesty much language evil blasphemous fear meet many bad example learn look godliness way different accustom home fear short pass same painful temptation subject succumb 
48,"""Well, Eric, this is all true. Yet, knowing this, I say, by all means let Vernon come to Roslyn. The innocence of mere ignorance is a poor thing; it _cannot_, under any circumstances, be permanent, nor is it at all valuable as a foundation of character. The true preparation for life, the true basis of a manly character, is not to have been ignorant of evil, but to have known it and avoided it; not to hare been sheltered from temptation, but to have passed through it and overcome it by God's help. Many have drawn exaggerated pictures of the lowness of public school morality; the best answer is to point to the good and splendid men that have been trained in public schools, and who lose no opportunity of recurring to them with affection. It is quite possible to be _in_ the little world of school-life, and yet not _of_ it. The ruin of human souls can never be achieved by enemies from without, unless they be aided by traitors from within. Remember our lost friend; the peculiar lustre of his piety was caused by the circumstances under which he was placed. He often told me before his last hour, that he rejoiced to have been at Roslyn; that he had experienced there much real happiness, and derived in every way lasting good.",true know say means let come innocence mere ignorance poor thing _cannot_ circumstance permanent valuable foundation character true preparation life true basis manly character ignorant evil know avoid hare shelter temptation pass overcome help many draw exaggerate picture lowness public school morality good answer point good splendid man train public school lose opportunity recur affection possible little world school life ruin human soul achieve enemy aid traitor remember lose friend peculiar lustre piety cause circumstance place tell last hour rejoice experience much real happiness derive way last good
