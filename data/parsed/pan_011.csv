54,"That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see.

He did this because there is a saying in the Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.",course care full wrath grow up usual spoil get tree breathe quick short breath rate second do be saying time breathe grow up die kill possible

104,"“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right, “I am going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and counted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for just as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.",say think put right go give medicine go love give medicine give much course water bottle shake bottle count drop give certain medicinal quality occasion give draught portion prepare see look face make heart sink

127,"“Ay, ay.”",
128,“Then lead the way.”,lead way 
129,"Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.",dart near tree follow moment pirate make dreadful attack redskin air rent shriek clash steel be dead silence mouth open remain open fall knee arm extend arm extend blow direction beseech desert seize sword same think slain lust battle eye
