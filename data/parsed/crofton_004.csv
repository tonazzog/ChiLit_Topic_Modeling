2,"Mrs Shaw ordered dinner presently; and while it was being served, she desired Phil to brush his brother's clothes, as they were dusty from his ride.  All the while he was brushing (which, he did very roughly), and all the first part of dinner-time, Phil continued to tease Hugh about what he had said on the top of the coach.  Mrs Shaw spoke of the imprudence of talking freely before strangers; and Hugh could have told her that he did not need such a lecture at the very time that he found the same thing by his experience.  He did wish Phil would stop.  If anybody should ask him a question, he could not answer without crying. Then he remembered how his mother expected him to bear things; and he almost wished he was at home with her now, after all his longing to be away.  This thought nearly made him cry again; so he tried to dwell on how his mother would expect him to bear things: but neither of them had thought that morning, beside his box, that the first trial would come from Phil.  This again made him so nearly cry that his uncle observed his twitching face, and, without noticing him, said that he, for his part, did not want to see little boys wise before they had time to learn; and that the most silent companion he had ever been shut up with in a coach was certainly the least agreeable: and he went on to relate an adventure which has happened to more persons than one.  He had found the gentleman in the corner, with the shaggy coat, to be a bear--a tame bear, which had to take the quickest mode of conveyance, in order to be at a distant fair in good time.  Mr Shaw spun out his story, so that Hugh quite recovered himself, and laughed as much as anybody at his uncle having formed a bad opinion of Bruin in the early twilight, for his incivility in not bowing to the passenger who left the coach.",order dinner serve desire brush brother clothes dusty ride brush first part dinner time continue tease say top coach speak imprudence talk stranger tell need lecture very time find same thing experience wish stop ask question answer cry remember mother expect bear thing wish home longing thought make cry try dwell mother expect bear thing think morning box first trial come make cry uncle observe twitching face notice say part want see little boy wise have time learn silent companion shut coach least agreeable go relate adventure happen more person find gentleman corner shaggy coat bear tame bear have take quick mode conveyance order distant fair good time spun story recover laugh uncle form bad opinion early twilight incivility bow passenger leave coach 
3,"After dinner, Phil thought it time to be off to Crofton.  He had missed something by coming away at all to-day; and he was not going to run the chance of losing the top of the class by not having time to do his Sallust properly.  Mrs Shaw said they must have some of her plums before they went, and a glass of wine; and Mr Shaw ordered the gig, saying he would drive them, and thus no time would be lost, though he hoped Phil would not mind being at the bottom of every class for once to help his brother, seeing how soon a diligent boy might work his way up again.  Phil replied that that was not so easy as people might think, when there was one like Joe Cape determined to keep him down, if he could once get him down.",dinner think time miss come day go run chance lose top class have time do say have plum go glass wine order gig say drive time lose hope mind bottom class help brother see diligent boy work way reply easy person think be determine keep get

5,"""Where is the use of my meddling?"" said Phil.  ""He can't rise for years to come.  Besides--""",use meddling say rise year come

10,"Hugh could not help clapping his hands at the prospect this held out to him.  Phil took the act for triumphing over him, and went on to say, very insultingly, that a little fellow who had been brought up among the girls all his life, and had learned of nobody but Miss Harold, could not be expected to cut any figure among boys.  Hugh looked so grieved for a moment, and then suddenly so relieved, that his kind uncle wondered what was in his mind.  He took the boy between his knees and asked him.",help clap hand prospect hold take act triumph go say little fellow bring girl life learn expect cut figure boy look grieve moment relieve kind uncle wonder mind take boy knee ask 
11,"Hugh loved his uncle already, as if he had always known him.  He put his arms round his neck, and whispered in his ear what he was thinking of;-- his mother's saying that God could and would, if He was sought, put the spirit of a man into the feeblest child.",love uncle know put arm neck whisper ear think mother say seek put spirit man feeblest child 
12,"""True!--quite true!  I am very glad you know that, my boy.  That will help you to learn at Crofton, though it is better than anything they can teach you in their school-room.""",true true glad know boy help learn good teach school room 
13,"Mrs Shaw and Phil looked curious; but Mr Shaw did not repeat a word of what Hugh had said.  He put the boy away from his knees, because he heard the gig coming round.",look curious repeat word say put boy knee hear gig come 
14,"Mrs Shaw told Hugh that she hoped he would spend some of his Sundays with his uncle and her; and his uncle added that he must come on holidays as well as Sundays,--there was so much to see about the mill.",tell hope spend uncle uncle add come holiday be much see mill 
15,"Phil was amused, and somewhat pleased, to find how exactly Hugh remembered his description of the place and neighbourhood.  He recognised the duck-pond under the hedge by the road-side, with the very finest blackberries growing above it, just out of reach.  The church he knew, of course, and the row of chestnuts, whose leaves were just beginning to fall; and the high wall dividing the orchard from the playground.  That must have been the wall on which Mr Tooke's little boy used to be placed to frighten him.  It did not look so very high as Hugh had fancied it.  One thing which he had never seen or heard of was the bell, under its little roof on the ridge of Mr Tooke's great house. Was it to call in the boys to school, or for an alarm?  His uncle told him it might serve the one purpose in the day, and the other by night; and that almost every large farm thereabouts had such a bell on the top of the house.",amuse pleased find remember description place neighbourhood recognise duck pond hedge road side fine blackberry grow reach church know course row chestnut leave begin fall high wall divide orchard playground wall little boy use place frighten look high fancy thing see hear bell little roof ridge great house call boy school alarm uncle tell serve purpose day other night large farm thereabout have bell top house 
16,"The sun was near its setting when they came in sight of the Crofton house.  A long range of windows glittered in the yellow light, and Phil said that the lower row all belonged to the school-room;--that whole row.",sun setting come sight house long range window glitter yellow light say low row belong school room whole row 
17,"In the midst of his explanations Phil stopped, and his manner grew more rough than ever--with a sort of shyness in it too.  It was because some of the boys were within hearing, leaning over the pales which separated the playground from the road.",midst explanation stop manner grow rough sort shyness boy hearing lean pale separate playground road 
18,"""I say; hollo there!"" cried one.  ""Is that Prater you have got with you?""",say cry get

22,"The talk at the palings still went on, as the gig rolled quietly in the sandy by-road.",talk paling go gig roll sandy road 
23,"""Prater!"" poor Hugh exclaimed.  ""What a name!""",poor exclaim name 
24,"""Yes; that is you,"" said his uncle.  ""You know now what your nick-name will be.  Every boy has one or another: and yours might have been worse, because you might have done many a worse thing to earn it.""",say uncle know nick name boy have bad do many bad thing earn

29,"Perhaps Mr Shaw hoped that through one of the boys the usher would get a new nick-name for his ill-nature in telling tales of a little boy, before he was so much as seen by his companions.  He certainly put it into their heads, whether they would make use of it or not.",hope boy usher get new nick name ill nature tell tale little boy much see companion put head make use 
30,"Mr Tooke was out, taking his evening ride; but Mr Shaw would not drive off till he had seen Mrs Watson, and introduced his younger nephew to her, observing to her that he was but a little fellow to come among such a number of rough boys.  Mrs Watson smiled kindly at Hugh, and said she was glad he had a brother in the school, to prevent his feeling lonely at first.  It would not take many days, she hoped, to make him feel quite at home.  Mr Shaw slipped half-a-crown into Hugh's hand, and whispered to him to try to keep it safe in his inner pocket Hugh ran after him to the door, to tell him he had five shillings already--safe in his box: but his uncle would not take back the half-crown.  He thought that, in course of time, Hugh would want all the money he had.",take evening ride drive see introduce young nephew observe little fellow come number rough boy smile say glad have brother school prevent feeling lonely first take many day hope make feel home slip half crown hand whisper try keep safe inner pocket run door tell have shilling safe box uncle take half crown think course time want money have 
31,"Mrs Watson desired Phil to show his brother where he was to sleep, and to help him to put by his clothes.  Phil was in a hurry to get to his Sallust; so that he was not sorry when Mrs Watson herself came up to see that the boy's clothes were laid properly in the deep drawer in which Hugh was to keep his things.  Phil then slipped away.",desire show brother sleep help put clothes hurry get sorry come see boy clothes lay deep drawer keep thing slip 
32,"""Dear me!"" said Mrs Watson, turning over one of Hugh's new collars, ""we must have something different from this.  These collars tied with a black ribbon are never tidy.  They are always over one shoulder or the other.""",say turn new collar have different collar tie black ribbon tidy shoulder other 
33,"""My sisters made them; and they worked so hard to get them done!"" said Hugh.",sister make work get do say 
34,"""Very well--very right: only it is a pity they are not of a better make. Every Sunday at church, I shall see your collar awry--and every time you go to your aunt's, she will think we do not make you neat.  I must see about that.  Here are good stockings, however--properly stout.

36,"""Of course; I don't doubt that.  We must have you measured to-morrow for some boots fitter for the country than these.  We have no London pavement here.""",course doubt measure boot fitter country have pavement 
37,"And so Mrs Watson went on, sometimes approving and sometimes criticising, till Hugh did not know whether to cry or to be angry. After all the pains his mother and sisters had taken about his things, they were to be found fault with in this way!",go approve criticise know cry angry pain mother sister take thing find fault way 
38,"When his box was emptied, and his drawer filled, Mrs Watson took him into the school-room, where the boys were at supper.  Outside the door the buzz seemed prodigious, and Hugh hoped that, in such a bustle, nobody would notice him.  Here he was quite mistaken.  The moment he entered there was a hush, and all eyes were turned upon him, except his brother's.  Phil hardly looked up from his book; but he made room for Hugh between himself and another boy, and drew the great plate of bread within reach.  Mrs Watson saw that Hugh had his basin of milk; and he found it a good thing to have something to do while so many eyes were upon him.  He felt that he might have cried if he had not had his supper to eat.",box empty drawer fill take school room boy supper door buzz seem prodigious hope bustle notice mistaken moment enter hush eye turn brother look book make room boy draw great plate bread reach see have basin milk find good thing have do many eye feel cry have supper eat 
39,"The usher sat at the top of the table, reading.  Mrs Watson called his attention to Hugh; and Hugh stood up and made his bow.  His face was red, as much with anger as timidity, when he recognised in him the passenger who had sat beside the coachman.",usher sit top table read call attention stand make bow face red much anger timidity recognise passenger sit coachman 
40,"""Perhaps, Mr Carnaby,"" said Mrs Watson, ""you will find something for this young gentleman to do, when he has had his supper, while the rest are learning their lessons.  To-morrow he will have his own lessons; but to-night--""",say find young gentleman do have supper rest learn lesson have own lesson night 
41,"""There is always the multiplication-table,"" replied Mr Carnaby.  ""The young gentleman is partial to that, I fancy.""",be multiplication table reply young gentleman partial fancy 
42,"Hugh reddened, and applied himself to his bread and milk.",redden apply bread milk 
43,"""Never mind a joke,"" whispered Mrs Watson.  ""We won't plague you with the multiplication-table the first evening.  I will find you a book or something.  Meantime, there is a companion for you--I forgot that.""",mind joke whisper plague multiplication table first evening find book be companion forget 
44,"The good lady went down the room, and brought back a boy who seemed to be doing all he could to stop crying.  He dashed his hand over his eyes every minute, and could not look anybody in the face.  He had finished his supper, and was at a loss what to do next, as he had only arrived that morning, and did not know anybody at Crofton.  His name was Tom Holt, and he was ten years old.",good lady go room bring boy seem do stop cry dash hand eye minute look face finish supper loss do arrive morning know name year old 
45,"When they had told their names and ages, and where they came from, the boys did not know what to say next; and Hugh wished Phil would stop murmuring over his Sallust and looking in the dictionary every minute; but Mrs Watson did not forget the strangers.  She brought them Cook's Voyages out of the library, to amuse themselves with, on condition of their delivering the book to Mr Carnaby at bedtime.",tell name age come boy know say wish stop murmure look dictionary minute forget stranger bring library amuse condition deliver book bedtime 
46,"The rest of the evening passed away very pleasantly.  Hugh told Holt a great deal about Broadstairs and the South Sea Islands, and confided to him his own hopes of being a sailor, and going round the world; and, if possible, making his way straight through China,--the most difficult country left to travel in, he believed, except some parts of Africa.  He did not want to cross the Great Desert, on account of the heat.  He knew something of what that was by the leads at home, when the sun was on them.  What was the greatest heat Holt had ever felt?  Then came the surprise.  Holt had last come from his uncle's farm; but he was born in India, and had lived there till eighteen months ago.  So, while Hugh had chattered away about the sea at Broadstairs, and the heat on the leads at home, his companion had come fourteen thousand miles over the ocean, and had felt a heat nearly as extreme as that of the Great Desert!  Holt was very unassuming too.  He talked of the heat of gleaning in his uncle's harvest-fields, and of the kitchen when the harvest-supper was cooking; owning that he remembered he had felt hotter in India.  Hugh heaped questions upon him about his native country and the voyage; and Holt liked to be asked: so that the boys were not at all like strangers just met for the first time.  They raised their voices in the eagerness of their talk, from a whisper so as to be heard quite across the table, above the hum and buzz of above thirty others, who were learning their lessons half-aloud.  At last Hugh was startled by hearing the words ""Prater"", ""Prater the second.""  He was silent instantly, to Holt's great wonder.",rest evening pass tell great deal confide own hope sailor go world possible make way difficult country leave travel believe part want cross great account heat know lead home sun great heat feel come surprise come uncle farm bear live month chatter sea heat lead home companion come mile ocean feel heat extreme great unassuming talk heat glean uncle harvest field kitchen harvest supper cook own remember feel hot heap question native country voyage like ask boy stranger meet first time raise voice eagerness talk whisper hear table hum buzz other learn lesson half last startle hear word second silent great wonder 
47,"Without raising his eyes from his book, Phil said, so as to be heard as far as the usher,--",raise eye book say hear usher 
48,"""Who prated, of Prater the second?  Who is Prater the third?""",prate second third 
49,"There was a laugh which provoked the usher to come and see whereabouts in Sallust such a passage as this was to be found.  Not finding any such, he knuckled Phil's head, and pulled his hair, till Hugh cried out--",be laugh provoke usher come see whereabouts passage find find such knuckle head pull hair cry 
50,"""O, don't, sir!  Don't hurt him so!""",sir hurt 
51,"""Do you call that hurting?  You will soon find what hurting is, when you become acquainted with our birch.  You shall have four times seven with our birch--Let us see,--that is your favourite number, I think.""",call hurt find hurt become acquainted birch have time birch let see favourite number think 
52,"The usher looked round, and almost everybody laughed.",usher look laugh

54,"""Because you have not my secret about four times seven.""",secret time 
55,"""Did not I hear your father?  Eh?""",hear father

57,"Mr Carnaby said something about the impertinence of little boys, as if they could have secrets, and then declared it high time that the youngsters should go to bed.  Hugh delivered Cook's Voyages into his hands, and then bade Phil good-night.  He was just going to put his face up to be kissed, but recollected in time that he was to leave off kissing when he went to school.  He held out his hand, but Phil seemed not to see it, and only told him to be sure to lie enough on one side, so as to leave him room; and that he was to take the side of the bed next the window.  Hugh nodded and went off, with Holt and two more, who slept in the same room.",say impertinence little boy have secret declare high time youngster go bed deliver hand bid good night go put face kiss recollect time leave kiss go school hold hand seem see tell sure lie side leave room take side bed window nod go more sleep same room 
58,"The two who were not new boys were in bed in a minute; and when they saw Hugh wash his face and hands, they sat up in bed to stare.  One of them told him that he had better not do that, as the maid would be coming for the light, and would leave him in the dark, and report of him if he was not in bed.  So Hugh made a great splutter, and did not half dry his face, and left the water in the basin;--a thing which they told him was not allowed.  He saw that the others had not kneeled down to say their prayers,--a practice which he had never omitted since he could say a prayer, except when he had the measles.  He knew the boys were watching him; but he thought of his mother, and how she had taught him to pray at her knee.  He hid himself as well as he could with the scanty bed-curtains, and kneeled.  He could not attend to the words he said, while feeling that eyes were upon him; and before he had done, the maid came in for the candle.  She waited; but when he got into bed, she told him that he must be quicker to-morrow night, as she had no time to spare waiting for the candle.",new boy bed minute see wash face hand sit bed stare tell do maid come light leave dark report bed make great splutter half dry face leave water basin thing tell allow see other kneel say prayer practice omit say prayer have measle know boy watch think mother teach pray knee hide scanty bed curtain kneel attend word say feel eye do maid come candle wait get bed tell quick night have time spare wait candle 
59,"Hugh was more tired than he had ever been in his life.  This had been the longest day he had ever known.  It seemed more like a week than a day.  Yet he could not go to sleep.  He had forgotten to ask Phil to be sure and wake him in time in the morning: and now he must keep awake till Phil came, to say this.  Then, he could not but ask himself whether he liked, and should like, being at school as much as he expected; and when he felt how very unlike home it was, and how rough everybody seemed, and how Phil appeared almost as if he was ashamed of him, instead of helping him, he was so miserable he did not know what to do. He cried bitterly,--cried till his pillow was quite wet, and he was almost choked with his grief; for he tried hard not to let his sobs be heard.  After awhile, he felt what he might do.  Though he had kneeled he had not really prayed: and if he had, God is never weary of prayers. It was a happy thought to Hugh that his very best friend was with him still, and that he might speak to Him at any time.  He spoke now in his heart; and a great comfort it was.  He said--",tired life long day know seem week day go sleep forget ask sure wake time morning keep awake come say ask like like school expect feel home rough seem appear ashamed help miserable know do cry cry pillow wet choke grief try let sob hear feel do kneel pray have weary prayer happy thought good friend speak time speak heart great comfort say

Please, make people kind to me till I am used to them; and keep up a brave heart in me, if they are not.  Help me not to mind little things; but to do my lessons well, that I may get to like being a Crofton boy, as I thought I should.  I love them all at home very much,--better than I ever did before.

61,This was the most of what he had to say; and he dropped asleep with the feeling that God was listening to him.,most have say drop feeling listen 
62,"After a long while, as it seemed to him, though it was only an hour, there was a light and some bustle in the room.  It was Phil and two others coming to bed.",long while seem hour be light bustle room other come bed
