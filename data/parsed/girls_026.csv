1,CHAPTER 26. UNDER THE LAUREL-BUSH.,
2,"Mrs Willis owned to herself that she was nonplussed; it was quite impossible to allow Annie to neglect her studies, and yet little Nan's health was still too precarious to allow her to run the risk of having the child constantly fretted.",own nonpluss impossible allow neglect study little health precarious allow run risk have child fret 
3,"Suddenly a welcome idea occurred to her; she would write at once to Nan's old nurse, and see if she could come to Lavender House for the remainder of the present term.  Mrs Willis dispatched her letter that very day, and by the following evening the nurse was once more in possession of her much-loved little charge.  The habits of her babyhood were too strong for Nan; she returned to them gladly enough, and though in her heart of hearts she was still intensely loyal to Annie, she no longer fretted when she was not with her.",welcome idea occur write old nurse see come remainder present term dispatch letter day follow evening nurse more possession love little charge habit babyhood strong return heart heart loyal fret

5,"Annie found herself at this time in an ever-shifting mood--one moment she longed intensely for a kiss, and a fervent pardon from Mrs Willis's lips; another, she said to herself defiantly she could and would live without it; one moment the hungry and sorrowful look in Hester's eyes went straight to Annie's heart, and she wished she might restore her little treasure whom she had stolen; the next she rejoiced in her strange power over Nan, and resolved to keep all the love she could get.",find time shift mood moment long kiss fervent pardon lip say live moment hungry sorrowful look eye go heart wish restore little treasure steal next rejoice strange power resolve keep love get

7,"A few days after the arrival of Nan's nurse Mrs Willis was obliged unexpectedly to leave home; a near relative was dangerously ill in London, and the school-mistress went away in much trouble and anxiety. Some of her favourite pupils flocked to the front entrance to see their beloved mistress off.  Amongst the group Cecil stood, and several girls of the first-class; many of the little girls were also present, but Annie was not amongst them.  Just at the last moment she rushed up breathlessly; she was tying some starry jasmine and some blue forget-me-nots together, and as the carriage was moving off she flung the charming bouquet into her mistress's lap.",few day arrival nurse oblige leave near relative ill school mistress go much trouble anxiety favourite pupil flock front entrance see beloved mistress group stand several girl first class many little girl present last moment rush tie starry jasmine blue forget not carriage move flung charming bouquet mistress lap

10,"The carriage disappeared down the avenue, and the group of girls melted away.  Cecil looked round for Annie, but Annie had been the first to disappear.",carriage disappear avenue group girl melt look first disappear 
11,"When her mistress had kissed the flowers and smiled at her, Annie darted into the shrubbery and stood there wiping the fast-falling tears from her eyes.  She was interrupted in this occupation by the sudden cries of two glad and eager voices, and instantly her hands were taken, and some girls rather younger than herself began to drag her in the opposite direction through the shrubbery.",mistress kiss flower smile dart shrubbery stand wipe fast fall tear eye interrupt occupation sudden cry glad eager voice hand take girl young begin drag opposite direction shrubbery 
12,"""Come, Annie--come at once, Annie, darling,"" exclaimed Phyllis and Nora Raymond.  ""The basket has come; it's under the thick laurel-tree in the back avenue.

15,"The three girls scampered down the back avenue, where they found five of their companions, amongst them Susan Drummond, standing in different attitudes of expectation near a very large and low-growing laurel-tree. Everyone raised a shout when Annie appeared; she was undoubtedly recognised as queen and leader of the proceedings.  She took her post without an instant's hesitation, and began ordering her willing subjects about.",girl scamper back avenue find companion stand different attitude expectation large low grow laurel tree raise shout appear recognise queen leader proceedings take post instant hesitation begin order willing subject 
16,"""Now, is the coast clear? yes, I think so.  Come, Susie, greedy as you are, you must take your part.  You alone of all of us can cackle with the exact imitation of an old hen: get behind that tree at once and watch the yard.  Don't forget to cackle for your life if you even see the shadow of a footfall.  Norah, my pretty birdie, you must be the thrush for the nonce; here, lake your post, watch the lawn and the front avenue.  Now then, girls, the rest of us can see what spoils Betty has provided for us.""",coast clear think come greedy take part alone cackle exact imitation old hen get tree watch yard forget cackle life see shadow footfall pretty birdie thrush nonce lake post watch lawn front avenue girl rest see spoil provide

18,"""On, oh!  I say, cherries! and what a lot!  Good Betty! dear, darling Betty! you gathered those from your own trees, and they are as ripe as your apple-blossom cheeks!  Now then, what next?  I do declare, meringues!  Betty knew my weakness.  Twelve meringues--that is one and a half apiece; Susan Drummond sha'n't have more than her share.  Meringues and cheesecakes and--tartlets--oh! oh! what a duck Betty is!  A plum-cake--good, excellent Betty, she deserves to be canonised!  What have we here?  Roast chickens--better and better!  What is in this parcel?  Slices of ham; Betty knew she dare not show her face again if she forgot the ham.  Knives and forks, spoons--fresh rolls--salt and pepper, and a dozen bottles of ginger-beer, and a little corkscrew in case we want it.""",say cherry lot good dear darling gather own tree ripe apple blossom cheek declare meringue know weakness meringue half apiece have more share meringue cheesecake tartlet duck plum cake good excellent deserve canonise roast chicken good good parcel slice ham know show face forget ham nnive fork spoon fresh roll salt pepper bottle ginger beer little corkscrew case want 
19,"These various exclamations came from many lips.  The contents of the basket were carefully and tenderly replaced, the lid was fastened down, and it was once more consigned to its hiding-place under the thick boughs of the laurel.",various exclamation come many lip content basket replace lid fasten consign hiding place thick bough laurel
