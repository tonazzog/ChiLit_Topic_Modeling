3," On Saturday afternoon, about half-past five, Philip Morville found himself driving up to the well-known front door of Hollywell. At the door he heard that every one was out excepting Lady Morville, who never came down till the evening, save for a drive in the carriage.",afternoon half past find drive know front door door hear one except come evening save drive carriage 
4,"He entered the drawing-room, and gazed on the scene where he had spent so many happy hours, only darkened by that one evil spot, that had grown till it not only poisoned his own mind, but cast a gloom over that bright home.",enter draw room gaze scene spend many happy hour darken evil spot grow poison own mind cast gloom bright home 
5,"All was as usual. Charles’s sofa, little table, books, and inkstand, the work-boxes on the table, the newspaper in Mr. Edmonstone’s old folds. Only the piano was closed, and an accumulation of books on the hinge told how long it had been so; and the plants in the bay window were brown and dry, not as when they were Amabel’s cherished nurslings. He remembered Amabel’s laughing face and abundant curls, when she carried in the camellia, and thought how little he guessed then that he should be the destroyer of the happiness of her young life. How should he meet her--a widow in her father’s house--or look at her fatherless child? He wondered how he had borne to come thither at all, and shrank at the thought that this very evening, in a few hours, he must see her.",usual sofa little table book inkstand work box table newspaper old fold piano close accumulation book hinge tell plant bay window brown dry cherish nursling remember laugh face abundant curl carry camellia think little guess destroyer happiness young life meet widow father house look fatherless child wonder borne come shrank thought very evening few hour see 
6,"The outer door opened, there was a soft step, and Amabel stood before him, pale, quiet, and with a smile of welcome. Her bands of hair looked glossy under her widow’s cap, and the deep black of her dress was relieved by the white robes of the babe that lay on her arm. She held out her hand, and he pressed it in silence.",outer door open be soft step stand pale quiet smile welcome band hair look glossy widow cap deep black dress relieve white robe babe lay arm hold hand press silence 
7,"‘I thought you would like just to see baby,’ said she, in a voice something like apology.",think like see baby say voice apology 
8,"He held out his arms to take it, for which Amy was by no means prepared. She was not quite happy even in trusting it in her sister’s arms, and she supposed he had never before touched an infant. But that was all nonsense, and she would not vex him with showing any reluctance; so she laid the little one on his arm, and saw his great hand holding it most carefully, but the next moment he turned abruptly from her. Poor silly little Amy, her heart beat not a little till he turned back, restored the babe, and while he walked hastily to the window, she saw that two large tear-drops had fallen on the white folds of its mantle. She did not speak; she guessed how much he must feel in thus holding Guy’s child, and, besides, her own tears would now flow so easily that she must be on her guard. She sat down, settled the little one on her knee, and gave him time to recover himself.",hold arm take means prepare happy trust sister arm suppose touch infant nonsense vex show reluctance lay little one arm see great hand hold next moment turn poor silly little heart beat little turn restore babe walk window see large tear drop fall white fold mantle speak guess much feel hold guy child own tear flow guard sit settle little one knee give time recover

10,"She looked up, wondering what he could mean.",look wonder mean 
11,"‘I will not delay in taking steps for restoring her inheritance,’ said he, hoping by determination to overpower Amabel, and make her believe it a settled and a right thing.",delay take step restore inheritance say hope determination overpower make believe settle right thing

15,"The nurse knocked at the door to fetch the baby, as Amabel had desired. When this interruption was over, Philip came and sat down opposite to her, and began with his most decided manner:--",nurse knock door fetch baby desire interruption come sit begin decide manner 
16,"‘You must listen to me, Amy, and not allow any scruples to prevent you from permitting your child to be restored to her just rights. You must see that the estate has come to me by circumstances such that no honest man can be justified in retaining it. The entail was made to exclude females, only because of the old Lady Granard. It is your duty to consent.’",listen allow scruple prevent permitt child restore right see estate come circumstance such honest man justify retain entail make exclude female old duty consent 
17,"‘The property has always gone in the male line,’ replied Amabel.",property go male line reply 
18,"‘There never was such a state of things. Old Sir Guy could never have thought of entailing it away from his own descendant on a distant cousin. It would be wrong of me to profit by these unforeseen contingencies, and you ought not, in justice to your child, to object.’",be state thing old think entail own descendant distant cousin wrong profit unforeseen contingency justice child object 
19,"He spoke so forcibly and decidedly that he thought he must have prevailed. But not one whit convinced, Amabel answered, in her own gentle voice, but beginning with a business-like argument:--‘Such a possibility was contemplated. It was all provided for in the marriage settlements. Indeed, I am afraid that, as it is, she will be a great deal too rich. Besides, Philip, I am sure this is exactly what Guy would have chosen,’ and the tears rose in her eyes. ‘The first thing that came into my head when she was born, was, that it was just what he wished, that I should have her for myself, and that you should take care of Redclyffe. I am certain now that he hoped it would be so. I know--indeed I do--that he took great pleasure in thinking of its being in your hands, and of your going on with all he began. You can’t have forgotten how much he left in your charge? If you were to give it up, it would be against his desire; and with that knowledge, how could I suffer it? Then think what a misfortune to her, poor little thing, to be a great heiress, and how very bad for Redclyffe to have no better a manager than me!

28,"‘I am better on the whole, but I doubt whether I shall ever be as strong as I used to be. That ought to make me hesitate, even if--’ then came a pause, while he put his hand over his face, and seemed struggling with irrepressible emotion; and after all he was obliged to take two walks to the window before he could recover composure, and could ask in a voice which he tried to make calm and steady, though his face was deeply flushed--‘Amy, how is Laura?’",good whole doubt strong use make hesitate come pause put hand face seem struggle irrepressible emotion oblige take walk window recover composure ask voice try make calm steady face flush

33,"‘They do--they have. But, Philip, it was one of the things I came down to say to you. I don’t think you must expect papa to begin about it himself. You know he does not like awkwardness, though he will be very glad when once it is done, and ready to meet you half way.’ He did not answer, and after a silence Amabel added, ‘Laura is out of doors. She and Charlotte take very long walks.’",thing come say think expect papa begin know like awkwardness glad do ready meet half way answer silence add door take long walk

35,"‘She is perfectly well, and to be busy has been a great help to her,’ said Amabel. ‘It was a great comfort that we did not know how ill you had been at Corfu, till the worst was over. Eveleen only mentioned it when you were better. I was very anxious, for I had some fears from the note that you sent by Arnaud. I am very glad to see you safe here, for I have felt all along that we forsook you; but I could not help it.’",well busy great help say great comfort know ill bad mention good anxious have fear note send glad see safe feel forsook help

38,"Philip’s colour rose. He stood up--sat down; then rising once more, leant on the mantel-piece, scarcely knowing how to face either of them--his aunt, with her well-merited displeasure, and Charles, who when he parted with him had accused him so justly--Charles, who had seen through him and had been treated with scorn.",colour rise stand sit rise lean mantel piece know face aunt merite displeasure part accuse see treat scorn 
39,"A few moments, and Charles came in, leaning on his mother. They both shook hands, exclaimed at finding Amabel downstairs, and Mrs. Edmonstone asked after Philip’s health in her would-be cordial manner. The two ladies then went up-stairs together, and thus ended that conference, in which both parties had shown rare magnanimity, of which they were perfectly unconscious; and perhaps the most remarkable part of all was that Philip quietly gave up the great renunciation and so-called sacrifice, with which he had been feeding his hopes, at the simple bidding of the gentle-spoken Amabel--not even telling her that he resigned it. He kept the possessions which he abhorred, and gave up the renunciation he had longed to make, and in this lay the true sacrifice, the greater because the world would think him the gainer.",few moment come lean mother shake hand exclaim find ask health cordial manner lady go stair end conference party show rare magnanimity unconscious remarkable part give great renunciation call sacrifice feed hope simple bid gentle speak tell resign keep possession abhorr give renunciation long make lay true sacrifice great world think gainer 
40,"When the mother and daughter were gone, the cousins were silent, Philip resting his elbow on the mantel-shelf and his head on his hand, and Charles sitting at the end of the sofa, warming first one hand, then the other, while he looked up to the altered face, and perceived in it grief and humiliation almost as plainly as illness. His keen eyes read that the sorrow was indeed more deeply rooted than he had hitherto believed, and that Amabel’s pity had not been wasted; and he was also struck by the change from the great personal strength that used to make nothing of lifting his whole weight.",mother daughter gone cousin silent rest elbow mantel shelf head hand sit end sofa warm first hand other look alter face perceive grief humiliation illness keen eye read sorrow rooted believe pity waste strike change great personal strength use make lift whole weight

42,"He had hardly ever spoken to Philip, so entirely without either bitterness or sarcasm, and his manner hardly seemed like that of the same person.",speak bitterness sarcasm manner seem same person

45,"‘But tell me, what is thought of Amabel? Is she as well as she ought to be?’",tell think 
46,"‘Yes, quite, they say--has recovered her strength very fast, and is in just the right spirits. She was churched yesterday, and was not the worse for it.

51,"Philip lapsed into thought, and presently said, abruptly, ‘When last we parted you told me I was malignant. You were right.’",laps thought say last part tell malignant right 
52,"‘Shake hands!’ was all Charles’s reply, and no more was said till Charles rose, saying it was time to dress. Philip was about to help him, but he answered, ‘No, thank you, I am above trusting to anything but my own crutches now; I am proud to show you what feats I can perform.’",shake hand reply more say rise say time dress about help answer thank trust own crutch proud show feat perform 
53,"Charles certainly did get on with less difficulty than heretofore, but it was more because he wanted to spare Philip fatigue than because he disdained assistance, that he chose to go alone. Moreover, he did what he had never done for any one before--he actually hopped the whole length of the passage, beyond his own door to do the honours of Philip’s room, and took a degree of pains for his comfort that seemed too marvellous to be true in one who had hitherto only lived to be attended on.",get less difficulty heretofore more want spare fatigue disdain assistance choose go do do one hopp whole length passage own door do honour room take degree pain comfort seem marvellous true live attend 
54,"By the time he had settled Philip, the rest of the party had come home, and he found himself wanted in the dressing-room, to help his mother to encourage his father to enter on the conversation with Philip in the evening, for poor Mr. Edmonstone was in such a worry and perplexity, that the whole space till the dinner-bell rang was insufficient to console him in. Laura, meanwhile, was with Amabel, who was trying to cheer her fluttering spirits and nerves, which, after having been so long harassed, gave way entirely at the moment of meeting Philip again. How would he regard her after her weakness in betraying him for want of self-command? Might he not be wishing to be free of one who had so disappointed him, and only persisting in the engagement from a sense of honour! The confidence in his affection, which had hitherto sustained her, was failing; and not all Amabel could say would reassure her. No one could judge of him but herself, his words were so cautious, and he had so much command over himself, that nobody could guess. Of course he felt bound to her; but if she saw one trace of his being only influenced by honour and pity, she would release him, and he should never see the struggle.",time settle rest party come find want dress room help mother encourage father enter conversation evening poor worry perplexity whole space dinner bell ring insufficient console try cheer flutter spirit nerve harass give way moment meet regard weakness betray want self command wish free disappoint persist engagement sense honour confidence affection sustain fail say reassure judge word cautious have much command guess course feel bind see trace influence honour pity release see struggle 
55,"She had worked herself up into almost a certainty that so it would be, and Amabel was afraid she would not be fit to go down to dinner; but the sound of the bell, and the necessity of moving, seemed to restore the habit of external composure in a moment. She settled her countenance, and left the room.",work certainty afraid fit go dinner sound bell necessity move seem restore habit external composure moment settle countenance leave room 
56,"Charlotte, meantime, had been dressing alone, and raging against Philip, declaring she could never bear to speak to him, and that if she was Amy she would never have chosen him for a godfather. And to think of his marrying just like a good hero in a book, and living very happy ever after! To be sure she was sorry for poor Laura; but it was all very wrong, and now they would be rewarded! How could Charlie be so provoking as to talk about his sorrow! She hoped he was sorry; and as to his illness, it served him right.",dress rage declare bear speak choose godfather think marrying good hero book live happy sure sorry poor wrong reward provoking talk sorrow hope sorry illness serve right 
57,"All this Charlotte communicated to Bustle; but Bustle had heard some mysterious noise, and insisted on going to investigate the cause; and Charlotte, finding her own domain dark and cold, and private conferences going on in Amabel’s apartment and the dressing-room, was fain to follow him down-stairs, as soon as her toilet was complete, only hoping Philip would keep out of the way.",communicate hear mysterious noise insist go investigate cause find own domain dark cold private conference go apartment dress room fain follow stair toilet complete hope keep way 
58,"But, behold, there he was; and even Bustle was propitiated, for she found him, his nose on Philip’s knee, looking up in his face, and wagging his tail, while Philip stroked and patted him, and could hardly bear the appealing expression of the eyes, that, always wistful, now seemed to every one to be looking for his master.",propitiate find nose knee look face wag tail stroke patt bear appealing expression eye wistful seem one look master 
59,"To see this attention to Bustle won Charlotte over in a moment. ‘How are you, Philip? Good dog, dear old Bustle!’ came in a breath, and they were both making much of the dog, when she amicably asked if he had seen the baby, and became eager in telling about the christening.",see attention win moment good dog dear old bustle come breath make much dog ask see baby become eager tell christening 
60,"The dinner-bell brought every one down but Amabel. The trembling hands of Philip and Laura met for a moment, and they were in the dining-room.",dinner bell bring one tremble hand meet moment dining room 
61,"Diligently and dutifully did Charles and Mrs. Edmonstone keep up the conversation; the latter about her shopping, the former about the acquaintances who had come to speak to him as he sat in the carriage. As soon as possible, Mrs. Edmonstone left the dining-room, then Laura flew up again to the dressing-room, sank down on a footstool by Amabel’s side, and exclaiming, ‘O Amy, he is looking so ill!’ burst into a flood of tears.",keep conversation latter shopping former acquaintance come speak sit carriage possible leave dining room fly dress room sink footstool side exclaim look ill burst flood tear 
62,"The change had been a shock for which Laura had not been prepared. Amy, who had seen him look so much worse, had not thought of it, and it overcame Laura more than all her anxieties, lest his love should be forfeited. She sobbed inconsolably over the alteration, and it was long before Amabel could get her to hear that his face was much less thin now, and that he was altogether much stronger; it was fatigue and anxiety to-night, and to-morrow he would be better. Laura proceeded to brood over her belief that his altered demeanour, his settled melancholy, his not seeking her eye, his cold shake of the hand, all arose from the diminution of his love, and his dislike to be encumbered with a weak, foolish wife, with whom he had entangled himself when he deemed her worthy of him. She dwelt on all this in silence, as she sat at her sister’s feet, and Amy left her to think, only now and then giving some caress to her hair or cheek, and at each touch the desolate waste of life that poor Laura was unfolding before herself was rendered less dreary by the thought, ‘I have my sister still, and she knows sorrow too.’ Then she half envied Amy, who had lost her dearest by death, and held his heart fast to the last; not, like herself, doomed to see the love decay for which she had endured so long--decay at the very moment when the suspense was over.",change shock prepare see look bad think overcame more anxiety love forfeit sobb alteration long get hear face thin strong fatigue anxiety night good proceed briod belief alter demeanour settle melancholy seek eye cold shake hand arise diminution love dislike encumber weak foolish wife entangle deem worthy dwele silence sit sister foot leave think give caress hair cheek touch desolate waste life poor unfold render dreary thought have sister know sorrow half envie lose dearest death hold heart last doom see love decay endure decay very moment suspense

65,"They had remained sitting over the fire for a considerable space, waiting for each other to begin, Mr. Edmonstone irresolute, Philip striving to master his feelings, and to prevent increasing pain and confusion from making him forget what he intended, to say. At last, Mr. Edmonstone started up, pulled out his keys, took a candle, and said, ‘Come to the study--I’ll give you the Redclyffe papers.’",remain sit fire considerable space wait other begin striving master feeling prevent increase pain confusion make forget intend say last start pull key take candle say come study give paper

77,"They did not, however, exactly answer his ideas; Laura did not once look up, and Philip, instead of going boldly to take the place next her, sat down, holding his hand to his forehead, as if too much overpowered by indisposition to think of anything else. Such was in great measure the case; he was very much fatigued with the journey, and these different agitating scenes had increased the pain in his head to a violent degree; besides which, feeling that his aunt still regarded him as she did at Recoara, he could not bear to make any demonstration towards Laura before her, lest she might think it a sort of triumphant disregard of her just displeasure.",answer idea look go take place sit hold hand forehead overpower indisposition think else such great measure case fatigued journey different agitating scene increase pain head violent degree feel aunt regard bear make demonstration think sort triumphant disregard displeasure

79,"Mrs. Edmonstone waited on the headache with painful attention, but they all felt that the only thing to be done for the two poor things was to let them come to an explanation; so Charlotte was sent to bed, her mother went up to Amy, Charles carried off his father to the study, and they found themselves alone.",wait headache painful attention feel only thing do poor thing let come explanation send bed mother go carry father study find alone 
80,"Laura held down her face, and struggled to make her palpitating heart and dry tongue suffer her to begin the words to which she had wound herself up. Philip raised his hands from his eyes as the door shut, then rose up, and fixed them on Laura. She, too, looked up, as if to begin; their eyes met, and they understood all. He stepped towards her, and held out his hands. The next moment both hers were clasped in his--he had bent down and kissed her brow.",hold face struggle make palpitate heart dry tongue suffer begin word wind raise hand eye door shut rise fix look begin eye meet understand step hold hand next moment clasp bend kiss brow 
81,"No words of explanation passed between them. Laura knew he was her own, and needed no assurance that her misgivings had been vain. There was a start of extreme joy, such as she had known twice before, but it could be only for a moment while he looked so wretchedly unwell. It did but give her the right to attend to him. The first thing she said was to beg him to lie down on the sofa; her only care was to make him comfortable with cushions, and he was too entirely worn out to say anything he had intended, capable only of giving himself up to the repose of knowing her entirely his own, and of having her to take care of him. There he lay on the sofa, with his eyes shut, and Laura’s hand in his, while she sat beside him, neither of them speaking; and, excepting that she withdrew her hand, neither moved when the others returned.",word explanation pass know own need assurance misgiving vain be start extreme joy such know moment look unwell give right attend first thing say beg lie sofa only care make comfortable cushion wear say intend capable give repose know own have take care lay sofa eye shut hand sit speak except withdraw hand move other return

96,"Mrs. Edmonstone looked for a moment, while trying to check the tears that came at the thought of the night, one brief year ago, when she left Amy sleeping in the light of the Easter moon. Yet the sense of peace and serenity that had then given especial loveliness to the maiden’s chamber on that night, was there still with the young widow. It was dim lamplight now that beamed on the portrait of her husband, casting on it the shade of the little wooden cross in front, while she was shaded by the white curtains drawn from her bed round the infant’s little cot, so as to shut them both into the quiet twilight, where she lay with an expression of countenance that, though it was not sorrow, made Mrs. Edmonstone more ready to weep than if it had been; so with her last good night she left her.",look moment try check tear come thought night brief year leave sleep light moon sense peace serenity give especial loveliness maiden chamber night young widow dim lamplight beam portrait husband cast shade little wooden cross front shade white curtain draw bed infant little cot shut quiet twilight lay expression countenance sorrow make ready weep last good night leave 
97,"And Amabel always liked to be shut in by herself, dearly as she loved them all, and mamma especially; there was always something pleasant in being able to return to her own world, to rest in the thoughts of her husband, and in the possession of the little unconscious creature that had come to inhabit that inner world of hers, the creature that was only his and hers.",like shut love mamma be pleasant able return own world rest thought husband possession little unconscious creature come inhabit inner world creature 
98,"She had from the first always felt herself less lonely when quite alone, before with his papers, and now with his child; and could Mrs. Edmonstone have seen her face, she would have wept and wondered more, as Amy fondled and hushed her babe, whispering to it fond words which she could never have uttered in the presence of any one who could understand them, and which had much of her extreme youthfulness in them. Not one was so often repeated or so endearing as ‘Guy’s baby! Guy’s own dear little girl!’ It did not mean half so much when she called it her baby; and she loved to tell the little one that her father had been the best and the dearest, but he was gone away, and would she be contented to be loving and good with only her mother to take care of her, and tell her, as well as she could, what a father hers was, when she was old enough to know about him?",have first feel lonely alone paper child see face goot wonder more fondle hush babe whisper fond word utter presence one understand have much extreme youthfulness repeat endearing guy baby guy own dear little girl mean half much call baby love tell little one father good dearest go content loving good mother take care tell father old know 
99,"To-night, Amy told her much in that soft, solemn, murmuring tone, about what was to befall her to-morrow, and the great blessings to be given to her, and how the poor little fatherless one would be embraced in the arms of His mercy, and received by her great Father in heaven:--‘Ay, and brought nearer to your own papa, and know him in some inner way, and he will know his little child then, for you will be as good and pure and bright as he, and you will belong to the great communion of saints to-morrow, you precious little one, and be so much nearer to him as you will be so much better than I. Oh! baby, if we can but both endure to the end!’",night tell much soft solemn murmure tone befall great blessing give poor little fatherless one embrace arm mercy receive great father heaven bring own papa know inner way know little child good pure bright belong great communion saint precious little one nearer good baby endure end
