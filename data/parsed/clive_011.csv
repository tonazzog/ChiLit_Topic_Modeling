1,CHAPTER 10. The Fall Of Seringam.,fall 
2," Although called an island, Seringam is in fact a long narrow tongue of land, running between the two branches of the river Kavari. In some places these arms are but a few hundred yards apart, and the island can therefore be defended against an attack along the land. But the retreat of the French by this line was equally difficult, as we held the narrowest part of the neck, two miles from Koiladi.",call island fact long narrow tongue land run branch river place arm few yard island defend attack land retreat line difficult hold narrowest part neck mile 
3,"Upon the south, our forces at Trichinopoli faced the French across the river. Upon the other side of the Kolrun, as the northern arm of the Kavari is called, the French could cross the river and make their retreat, if necessary, in any direction. The two principal roads, however, led from Paichandah, a strong fortified position on the bank of the river, facing the temple of Seringam.",south force face river other side northern arm call cross river make retreat necessary direction principal road lead strong fortify position bank river face temple 
4,"Clive saw that a force crossing the river, and taking up its position on the north, would entirely cut off Law's army in the island; would intercept any reinforcements sent by Dupleix to its rescue; and might compel the surrender of the whole French army. The attempt would, of course, be a dangerous one. The French force was considerably stronger than the English, and were the latter divided into two portions, entirely cut off from each other, the central point between them being occupied by the French, the latter would have an opportunity of throwing his whole force upon one after the other.",see force cross river take position north cut army island intercept reinforcement send rescue compel surrender whole french army attempt course dangerous one french force strong latter divide portion cut other central point occupy latter have opportunity throw whole force other 
5,"This danger would have been so great that, had the French been commanded by an able and active officer, the attempt would never have been made. Law, however, had shown amply that he had neither energy nor intelligence, and Major Lawrence therefore accepted Clive's proposal.",danger great command able active officer attempt make show have energy intelligence accept proposal 
6,"But to be successful, it was necessary that both portions of the English force should be well commanded. Major Lawrence felt confident in his own capacity to withstand Law upon the southern bank, and in case of necessity he could fall back under the guns of Trichinopoli. He felt sure that he could, with equal certainty, confide the command of the other party to Captain Clive. There was, however, the difficulty that he was the junior captain present; and that already great jealousy had been excited, among his seniors, by the rank which he occupied in the councils of Lawrence.",successful necessary portion english force command feel confident own capacity withstand southern bank case necessity fall gun feel sure equal certainty confide command other party be difficulty junior captain present great jealousy excite senior rank occupy council 
7,"Fortunately, the difficulty was settled by the native allies. Major Lawrence laid his plans before Muhammud Ali and his allies, whose cooperation and assistance were absolutely necessary. These, after hearing the proposal, agreed to give their assistance, but only upon the condition that Clive should be placed in command of the expeditionary party. They had already seen the paralysing effects of the incapacity of some English officers. Clive's defence of Arcot, and the victories of Arni and Kavaripak, had excited their intense admiration, and caused them to place unbounded confidence in him. Therefore they said:",difficulty settle native ally lay plan ally cooperation assistance necessary hear proposal agree give assistance condition place command expeditionary party see paraly effect incapacity english officer defence victory excite intense admiration cause place unbounded confidence say 
8,"""If Captain Clive commands, we will go--unless he commands, we do not.""",command go command 
9,"Major Lawrence was glad that the pressure thus placed upon him enabled him, without incurring a charge of favouritism, to place the command in the hands of the officer upon whom he most relied.",glad pressure place enable incurr charge favouritism place command hand officer rely 
10,"On the night of the 6th of April Clive set out; with a force composed of four hundred English, seven hundred Sepoys, three thousand Mahratta cavalry, a thousand Tanjore cavalry, six light guns and two heavy ones. Descending the river, he crossed the island at a point three miles to the east of Law's camping ground, and marched to Samieaveram, a town nine miles north of the island, and commanding the roads from the north and east.",night 6th set force compose sepoy cavalry cavalry light gun heavy one descend river cross island point mile east camping ground march town mile island commanding road north east 
11,"The movement was just made in time. Dupleix, utterly disgusted with Law, had resolved to displace him. D'Auteuil, the only officer he had of sufficient high rank to take his place, had not, when previously employed, betrayed any great energy or capacity. It appeared, nevertheless, that he was at any rate superior to Law. On the 10th of April, therefore, he despatched D'Auteuil, with a hundred and twenty French, and five hundred Sepoys, with four guns and a large convoy, to Seringam, where he was to take the command. When he arrived within fifteen miles of Samieaveram, he learned that Clive had possession of that village, and he determined upon a circuitous route, by which he might avoid him. He therefore sent a messenger to Law, to acquaint him with his plans, in order that he might aid him by making a diversion.",movement make time disgust resolve displace only officer have sufficient high rank take place employ betray great energy capacity appear rate superior 10th despatch french sepoy gun large convoy take command arrive mile learn have possession village determine circuitous route avoid send messenger acquaint plan order aid make diversion 
12,"Clive, in the meantime, had been at work. On the day after his arrival at Samieaveram, he attacked and captured the temple of Mansurpet, halfway between the village and the island. The temple was lofty, and stood on rising ground, and commanded a range of the country for many miles round.",meantime work day arrival attack capture temple village island temple lofty stand rise ground command range country many mile 
13,"On its top, Clive established a signal station. Upon the following day he carried the mud fort of Lalgudi, which was situated on the north bank of the river, two miles to the east of Paichandah, which now remained Law's only place of exit from the island.",top establish signal station follow day carry mud fort situate north bank river mile east remain only place exit island 
14,"D'Auteuil, after sending word to Law of his intentions, marched from Utatua, where he was lying, by a road to the west which would enable him to move round Samieaveram to Paichandah. Clive captured one of the messengers, and set off with his force to intercept him. D'Auteuil, however, received information by his spies of Clive's movement, and not wishing to fight a battle in the open, with a superior force, fell back to Utatua, while Clive returned to Samieaveram.",send word intention march lie road west enable move capture messenger set force intercept receive information spy movement wish fight battle open superior force fall return 
15,"Law, too, had received news of Clive's movement. Here was a chance of retrieving the misfortunes of the campaign. Paichandah being still in his hands, he could sally out with his whole force and that of Chunda Sahib, seize Samieaveram in Clive's absence, and extend his hand to D'Auteuil, or fall upon Clive's rear. Instead of this, he repeated the mistake he had made before Trichinopoli; and, instead of marching out with his whole force, he sent only eighty Europeans, of whom forty were deserters from the English army, and seven hundred Sepoys.",receive news movement chance retrieve misfortune campaign hand sally whole force seize absence extend hand fall rear repeat mistake make march whole force send deserter english army sepoy 
16,"The English returned from their march against D'Auteuil. The greater portion of the troops were housed in two temples, a quarter of a mile apart, known as the Large and Small Pagoda. Clive, with several of his officers, was in a caravansary close to the Small Pagoda.",return march great portion troops house temple quarter mile know large small several officer caravansary small 
17,"Charlie's company were on guard, and after paying a visit to the sentries, and seeing that all were on the alert, he returned to the caravansary. The day had been a long one, and the march under the heat of the sun very fatiguing. There was therefore but little conversation, and Charlie, finding, on his return from visiting the sentries, that his leader and the other officers had already wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lain down to rest, imitated their example.",company guard pay visit sentry see alert return caravansary day long one march heat sun fatiguing be little conversation find return visit sentry leader other officer wrap cloak lain rest imitate example 
18,"Half an hour later, the French column arrived at Samieaveram. The officer in command was a daring and determined man. Before reaching the place, he had heard that the English had returned; and, finding that he had been forestalled, he might well have returned to Law. He determined, however, to attempt to surprise the camp. He placed his deserters in front, and when the column, arriving near the Sepoy sentinel, was challenged, the officer in command of the deserters, an Irishman, stepped forward, and said that he had been sent by Major Lawrence to the support of Captain Clive. As the other English-speaking soldiers now came up, the sentry and native officer with him were completely deceived, and the latter sent a soldier to guide the column to the English quarter of the camp.",hour french column arrive officer command dare determined man reach place hear return find forestall return determine attempt surprise camp place deserter front column arrive sentinel challenge officer command deserter step say send support other speak soldier come sentry native officer deceive latter send soldier guide column english quarter camp 
19,"Without interruption, the column marched on through lines of sleeping Sepoys and Mahrattas until they reached the heart of the village. Here they were again challenged. They replied with a volley of musketry into the caravansary, and another into the pagoda. Then they rushed into the pagoda, bayoneting all they found there.",interruption column march line sleep reach heart village challenge reply volley musketry caravansary pagoda rush pagoda bayonet find 
20,"Charlie, who had just dropped off to sleep, sprang to his feet, as did the other officers. While, confused by the noise and suddenness of the attack, others scarcely understood what was happening, Clive's clear head and ready judgment grasped the situation at once.",drop sleep spring foot do other officer confuse noise suddenness attack other understand happen clear head ready judgment grasp situation 
21,"""Gentlemen,"" he said calmly, ""there is no firing going on in the direction of the Great Pagoda. Follow me there at once.""",gentlemen say be fire go direction great follow 
22,"Snatching up their arms, the officers followed him at a run. The whole village was a scene of wild confusion. The firing round the pagoda and caravansary were continuous. The Mahratta horsemen were climbing into their saddles, and riding away out into the plain; the Sepoys were running hither and thither.",snatch arm officer follow run whole village scene wild confusion fire pagoda caravansary continuous horsemen climb saddle ride plain run 
23,"At the pagoda he found the soldiers turning out under arms, and Clive, ordering his officers to do their best to rally the native troops in good order against the enemy, at once moved forward towards the caravansary, with two hundred English troops. On arriving there, he found a large body of Sepoys firing away at random. Believing them to be his own men, for the French and English Sepoys were alike dressed in white, he halted the English a few yards from them, and rushed among them, upbraiding them for their panic, striking them, and ordering them instantly to cease firing, and to form in order.",pagoda find soldier turn arm order officer do good rally native troops good order enemy move caravansary english troops arrive find large body sepoy fire random believe own man french english alike dress white halt few yard rush upbraid panic strike order cease fire form order 
24,"One of the Sepoy officers recognized Clive to be an Englishman, struck at him, and wounded him with his sword. Clive, still believing him to be one of his own men, was furious at what he considered an act of insolent insubordination; and, seizing him, dragged him across to the Small Pagoda to hand him over, as he supposed, to the guard there. To his astonishment he found six Frenchmen at the gate, and these at once summoned him to surrender.",officer recognize englishman strike wound sword believe own man furious consider act insolent insubordination seize drag small hand suppose guard astonishment find gate summon surrender 
25,"Great as was his surprise, he did not for a moment lose coolness, and at once told them that he had come to beg them to lay down their arms, that they were surrounded by his whole army, and that, unless they surrendered, his troops would give no quarter. So impressed were the Frenchmen with the firmness of the speaker that three of them at once surrendered, while the other three ran into the temple to inform their commander.",great surprise moment lose coolness tell come beg lay arm surround whole army surrender troops give quarter impress firmness speaker surrender other run temple inform commander 
26,"Clive took the three men who had surrendered, and returned to the English troops he had left near the caravansary. The French Sepoys had discovered that the English were enemies, and had moved quietly off.",take man surrender return english troops leave caravansary french discover enemy move 
27,"Confusion still reigned. Clive did not imagine, for a moment, that so daring an assault could have been made on his camp by a small body of enemies, and expected every moment an attack by Law's whole force. The commander of the French, in the pagoda, was disturbed by the news brought in by the three men from the gate, and despatched eight of his most intelligent men to ascertain exactly what was going on.",confusion reign imagine moment dare assault make camp small body enemy expect moment attack whole force commander pagoda disturb news bring man gate despatch intelligent man ascertain go 
28,"These, however, fell into the hands of the English; and the officer of the party, not knowing that the Small Pagoda was in the hands of the French, handed them over to a sergeant, and told him to take a party and escort his eight prisoners, and the three Captain Clive had captured, to that pagoda for confinement there.",fall hand officer party know small hand hand sergeant tell take party escort prisoner capture pagoda confinement 
29,"Upon arrival at the gate the Frenchmen at once joined their comrades, and these latter were also so bewildered at the affair, that they allowed the English sergeant and his guard to march off again, unmolested.",arrival gate join comrade latter bewilder affair allow english sergeant guard march unmolested 
30,"By this time, owing to the absence of all resistance elsewhere, Clive had learnt that the whole of the party who had entered the camp were in the Lesser Pagoda; and, as he was still expecting, momentarily, to be attacked by Law's main army, he determined to rid himself of this enemy in his midst. The pagoda was very strong, and only two men could enter abreast. Clive led his men to the attack, but so well did the French defend themselves that, after losing an officer and fifteen men, Clive determined to wait till morning.",time ow absence resistance learn whole party enter camp lesser expect attack main army determine rid enemy midst pagoda strong man enter abreast lead man attack defend lose officer man determine wait morning 
31,"The French officer, knowing that he was surrounded, and beyond the reach of all assistance, resolved upon cutting a way through, and at daylight his men sallied out from the temple. So fierce, however, was the fire with which the English received him, that twelve of his men were instantly killed, and the rest ran back into the temple.",french officer know surround reach assistance resolve cut way daylight man sall temple fierce fire receive man kill rest run temple 
32,"Clive, hoping that their commander would now surrender without further effusion of blood, advanced to the gateway and entered the porch to offer terms. He was himself so faint, from the loss of blood from his wounds, that he could not stand alone, but leaned against a wall, supported by two sergeants. The officer commanding the deserters came out to parley, but, after heaping abuse upon Clive, levelled his musket and discharged it at him. He missed Clive, but killed the two sergeants who were supporting him.",hope commander surrender further effusion blood advance gateway enter porch offer term faint loss blood wound stand learn wall support sergeant officer commanding deserter come parley heap abuse levell musket discharge miss kill sergeant support 
33,"The French officer in command, indignant at this conduct, rushed forward at once to disavow it; and stated that he had determined to defend the post to the last, solely for the sake of the deserters, but that the conduct of their officer had released him from that obligation, and he now therefore surrendered at once.",french officer command indignant conduct rush disavow state determine defend post last sake deserter conduct officer release obligation surrender 
34,"The instant day broke, and Clive saw that Law was not, as he expected, at hand, he despatched the Mahratta horse in pursuit of the French Sepoys. These were overtaken and cut to pieces, and not one man, of the force which Law had despatched against Clive returned to the island.",instant day break see expect hand despatch horse pursuit french overtake cut piece man force despatch return island 
35,"The English loss was heavy. The greater portion of the occupants of the Small Pagoda were bayoneted by the French, when they entered; and, as fifteen others were killed in the attack, it is probable that at least one-fourth of the English force under Clive were killed.",english loss heavy great portion occupant small bayonet french enter other kill attack probable least fourth english force kill 
36,"Clive's own escapes were extraordinary. In addition to those of being killed by the French Sepoys, among whom he ran by mistake, and of death at the hands of the treacherous deserter, he had one almost as close, when the French fired their volley into the caravansary. A box at his feet was shattered, and a servant who slept close to him was killed.",own escape extraordinary addition kill french run mistake death hand treacherous deserter have close fire volley caravansary box foot shattered servant sleep kill 
37,"Some days passed, after this attack, without any fresh movement on either side. Major Lawrence then determined to drive back D'Auteuil. He did not despatch Clive against him, as this would involve the risk that Law might again march out to surprise Samieaveram. He therefore directed Clive to remain at that place and watch the island, while he sent a force of a hundred and fifty English, four hundred Sepoys, five hundred Mahrattas, with four guns, to attack D'Auteuil; from his own force, under Captain Dalton. This officer, in the advance, marched his troops near Samieaveram; and, making as much show with them as he could, impressed D'Auteuil with the idea that the force was that of Clive.",day pass attack fresh movement side determine drive despatch involve risk march surprise direct remain place watch island send force gun attack own force officer advance march troops make much show impress idea force 
38,"Accordingly, he broke up his camp at Utatua in the night, abandoned his stores, and retreated hastily upon Valconda. Dalton then marched to Samieaveram, and placed his force at Clive's disposal; and, to prevent any disputes arising as to precedence and rank, offered himself to serve under him as a volunteer.",break camp night abandon store retreat march place force disposal prevent dispute arise precedence rank offer serve volunteer 
39,"Not only D'Auteuil, but Law, was deceived by Dalton's march. From the lofty towers of Seringam he saw the force marching towards Utatua, believed that Clive with his whole force had left Samieaveram, and did now what he should have before done--crossed the river with all his troops.",deceive march lofty tower see force march believe whole force leave do cross river troops 
40,"Clive's lookout on the temple of Mansurpet perceived what was going on, and signalled the news to Clive, who at once set out with his whole force; and, before Law was prepared to issue out from Paichandah, Clive was within a mile of that place. Law might still have fought with a fair chance of success, as he was far stronger than his enemy, but he was again the victim of indecision and want of energy, and, covered by Paichandah, he fell back across the river again.",lookout temple perceive go signall news set whole force prepare issue mile place law fight fair chance success strong enemy victim indecision want energy cover fall river 
41,"On the 15th of May Clive captured Paichandah, and then determined to give a final blow to D'Auteuil's force; which had, he learned, again set out to endeavour to relieve Law. He marched to Utatua to intercept him.",15th capture determined give final blow force learn set endeavour relieve march intercept 
42,"D'Auteuil, hearing of his coming, instantly fell back again to Valconda. The native chief of this town, however, seeing that the affairs of the French were desperate; and willing, like all his countrymen, to make his peace with the strongest, had already accepted bribes from the English; and upon D'Auteuil's return, closed the gates and refused to admit him. Clive soon arrived, and D'Auteuil, caught between two fires, surrendered with his whole force.",hear coming fall native chief town see affair desperate willing countryman make peace strong accept bribe return close gate refuse admit arrive catch fire surrender whole force 
43,"Had Law been a man of energy, he had yet a chance of escape. He had still seven or eight hundred French troops with him, two thousand Sepoys, and four thousand of Chunda Sahib's troops. He might, then, have easily crossed the Kavari at night and fallen upon Lawrence, whose force there now was greatly inferior to his own. Chunda Sahib, in vain, begged him to do so. His hesitation continued until, three days after the surrender of D'Auteuil, a battering train reached Lawrence; whereupon Law at once surrendered, his chief stipulation being that the life of Chunda Sahib should be spared.",man energy have chance escape have french troops troops cross night fall force inferior own vain begg do hesitation continue day surrender battering train reach surrender chief stipulation life spare 
44,"This promise was not kept. The unfortunate prince had preferred to surrender to the Rajah of Tanjore, who had several times intrigued secretly with him, rather than to Muhammud Ali or the English, whom he regarded as his implacable enemies. Had he placed himself in our hands, his life would have been safe. He was murdered, by the treacherous rajah, within twenty-four hours of his surrender.",promise keep unfortunate prince prefer surrender have several time intrigue regard implacable enemy place hand life safe murder treacherous rajah hour surrender 
45,"With the fall of Seringam terminated the contest for the supremacy of the Carnatic, between the English and French, fighting respectively on behalf of their puppets, Muhammud Ali and Chunda Sahib. This stage of the struggle was not a final one; but both by its circumstances, and by the prestige which we acquired in the eyes of the natives, it gave us a moral ascendency which, even when our fortunes were afterwards at their worst, was never lost again.",fall terminate contest supremacy english french fight behalf puppet stage struggle final one circumstance prestige acquire eye native give moral ascendency fortune bad lose 
46,"Muhammud Ali had, himself, gained but little in the struggle. He was, indeed, nominally ruler of the Carnatic, but he had to rely for his position solely on the support of the English bayonets. Indeed, the promises, of which he had been obliged to be lavish to his native allies, to keep them faithful to his cause, when that cause seemed all but lost, now came upon him to trouble him; and so precarious was his position, that he was obliged to ask the English to leave two hundred English troops, and fifteen hundred of their Sepoys, to protect the place against Murari Reo, and the Rajahs of Mysore and Tanjore.",gain little struggle ruler have rely position support english bayonet promise oblige lavish native ally keep faithful cause cause seem lose come trouble precarious position oblige ask leave english troops protect place 
47,"The fatigues of the expedition had been great and, when the force reached the seacoast, Major Lawrence was forced to retire to Fort Saint David to recover his health; while Clive, whose health had now greatly broken down, betook himself to Madras; which had, when the danger of invasion by the French was at an end, become the headquarters of the government of the presidency.",fatigue expedition great force reach seacoast force retire recover health health break betak danger invasion end become headquarters government presidency 
48,"There were, however, two French strongholds dangerously near to Madras, Covelong and Chengalpatt. Two hundred recruits had just arrived from England, and five hundred natives had been enlisted as Sepoys. Mr. Saunders begged Clive to take the command of these, and reduce the two fortresses. He took with him two twenty-four pounders, and four officers, of whom two were Charlie Marryat and Peters; to both of whom Clive was much attached, owing to their courage, readiness, and good humour.",be french stronghold recruit arrive native enlist begg take command reduce fortress take pounder officer attach ow courage readiness good humour 
49,"Covelong was first attacked. It mounted thirty guns, and was garrisoned by fifty French, and three hundred Sepoys.",attack mount gun garrison french sepoy 
50,"""I don't like the look o' things, Mr. Charles,"" Tim Kelly said. ""There's nothing but boys altogether, white and black. Does it stand to reason that a lot of gossoons, who haven't learnt the goose step, and haven't as much as a shred of faith, ayther in themselves or their officers, are fit to fight the French?""",like look thing say be boy white black stand reason lot gossoon learn goose step much shred faith ayther officer fit fight 
51,"""Oh, I don't know, Tim,"" Charlie said. ""Boys are just as plucky as men, in their way, and are ready to do all sorts of foolhardy things, which men would hesitate to attempt.""",know say boy plucky man way ready do sort foolhardy thing man hesitate attempt 
52,"""And that is so, Mr. Charles, when they've only other boys to dale with; but as they're growing up, they take some time before they're quite sure they're a match for men. That's what it is, yer honor, I tell ye, and you will see it, soon.""",have other boy dale grow take time sure match man honor tell see 
53,"Tim's predictions were speedily verified. The very morning after they arrived before the fort, the garrison made a sally, fell upon the troops, and killed one of their officers.",prediction verify very morning arrive fort garrison make sally fall troops kill officer 
54,"The whole of the new levies took to their heels, and fled away from the fight. Clive, with his three officers, threw himself among them and, for some time, in vain attempted to turn the tide. It was not, indeed, until several had been cut down that the rout was arrested, and they were brought back to their duty.",whole new levy take heel flead fight officer throw time vain attempt turn tide several cut rout arrest bring duty 
55,"A day or two later a shot, striking a rock, killed or wounded fourteen men; and excited such a panic, that it was some time before the rest would venture near the front.",day shot strike rock kill wound man excite panic time rest venture front 
56,"The enemy, with a considerable force, marched from Chengalpatt to relieve the place. Clive left half his force to continue the siege, and with the rest marched out and offered battle to the relieving force. Daring and confidence, as usual, prevailed. Had the enemy attacked, there is little doubt they would have put Clive's raw levies to flight. They were, however, cowed by his attitude of defiance, and retreated hastily.",enemy considerable force march relieve place leave force continue siege rest march offer battle relieve force daring confidence usual prevail enemy attack be little doubt put raw levy flight cow attitude defiance retreat 
57,"The governor of Covelong at once lost heart and surrendered the place; which he might have maintained, for months, against the force before it; and on the fourth day of the siege, capitulated.",governor lose heart surrender place maintain month force fourth day siege capitulate 
58,"A few hours afterwards the enemy from Chengalpatt, ignorant of the fall of the fort, again advanced; and Clive met them with his whole force. Taken by surprise, they suffered heavily. Clive pursued them to the gates of their fort, to which he at once laid siege.",few hour enemy ignorant fall fort advance meet whole force take surprise suffer pursue gate fort lay siege 
59,"Fortunately for the English, the commander of this place, like him of Covelong, was cowardly and incapable. Had it not been so, the fort, which was very strong, well provisioned, and well garrisoned, might have held out for an indefinite time. As it was, it surrendered on the fourth day, and Clive took possession on the 31st of August.",commander place cowardly incapable fort strong provision garrison hold indefinite time surrender fourth day take possession 31st 
60,"He returned to Madras, and there, a short time afterwards, married Miss Maskelyne. Finding his health, however, continuing to deteriorate, he sailed for Europe in February, 1753. It was but five years since he had first taken up arms to defend Fort Saint David, an unknown clerk, without prospects and without fortune, utterly discontented and disheartened.",return short time marry find health continue deteriorate sail year take arm defend unknown clerk prospect fortune discontented disheartened 
61,"Madras was in the hands of the French. Everywhere their policy was triumphant, and the soil surrounded by the walls of Saint David's, alone, remained to the English in Southern India. In the five years which had elapsed, all had changed. The English were masters of the Carnatic. The French were broken and discredited. The English were regarded by the natives throughout the country as the coming power; and of this great change, no slight portion was due to the energy and genius of Clive, himself.",hand policy triumphant soil surround wall remain southern year elapse change master break discredite regard native country come power great change slight portion due energy genius
