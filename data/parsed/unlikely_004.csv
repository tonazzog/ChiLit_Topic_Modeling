2," WHEN the Prince was born the Queen said to the King, “My dear, do be very, very careful about the invitations. You know what fairies are. They always come to the christening whether you invite them or not, and if you forget to invite one of them she always makes herself so terribly unpleasant.”",bear say dear careful invitation know fairy come christening invite forget invite make unpleasant 
3,"“My love,” said the King, “I will invite them all,” and he took out his diamond-pointed pen and wrote out the cards on the spot.",love say invite take diamond point pen write card spot 
4,"But just then a herald came in to bring news of war. So the King had to go off in a hurry. The invitations were sent out, but the christening had to be put off for a year. At the end of this time the King had subdued all his enemies, so he was very pleased with himself. The Prince was a year old, and he also was pleased with himself, as all good babies are, and found the little royal fingers and toes a fresh and ever-delightful mystery. And the Queen was pleased with herself, as all good mothers should be—so everything went merrily. The Palace was hung with cloth of silver and strewn with fresh daisies, in honour of the great day, and after all had eaten and drunk to their hearts’ content the fairies came near with the gifts they had brought to their godson the Prince.",herald come bring news war have go hurry invitation send christening have put year end time subdued enemy pleased year old pleased good baby find little royal finger toe fresh delightful mystery pleased good mother go hang cloth silver strewn fresh daisy honour great day eat drunk heart content fairy come gift bring godson

8,"And so they went on, foretelling for him all sorts of happy and desirable things. And as each fairy gave her gift she stooped and kissed the baby Prince, and then spreading her fine gossamer-gauze wings, fluttered away across the rosy garden. The crowd of fairies grew less and less, and there were only three left when the Queen pulled the King’s sleeve and whispered, “My dear, where’s Malevola?”",go foretell sort happy desirable thing fairy give gift stoop kiss baby spread fine gossamer gauze wing flutter rosy garden crowd fairy grow less less be left pull sleeve whisper dear

10,"“Then it must have been lost on the way,” said the Queen, “or she’d have been here——”",lose way say 
11,"“She _is_ here,” said a low voice in the Queen’s ear. Suddenly the room grew dark, grey clouds hid the sun, and all the daisies on the floor shut up quite close. The poor Queen gave a start and a scream, and the King, brave as he was, turned pale, for Malevola was a terrible fairy, and the dress she wore was not at all the thing for a christening. It was made of spiders’ webs matted together, dark and dank with the damp of the tomb and the dust of dungeons. Her wings were the wings of a great bat; spiders and newts crawled round her neck; a serpent coiled about her waist and little snakes twisted and writhed in her straight black hair.",say low voice ear room grow dark grey cloud hide sun daisy floor shut close poor give start scream brave turn pale terrible fairy dress wear thing christening make spider web matt dark dank damp tomb dust dungeon wing wing great bat spider newt crawl neck serpent coiled waist little snake twist writh straight black hair

13,"“Oh don’t!” she cried, and flung both arms round the cradle. The Prince was quite happy, playing with his new coral and bells, and looking at the Palace cat, who sat at the foot of the cradle washing herself.",cry flung arm cradle happy play new coral bell look cat sit foot cradle wash 
14,"“Now listen,” said Malevola, still speaking in the low, even voice that was so terrible. “You did not invite me to the christening. I’ve read my fairy tales, and I know what’s expected of a fairy who is left out on an occasion like this. I intend to curse your son.”",listen say speak low voice terrible invite christening read fairy tale know expect fairy leave occasion intend curse son 
15,"Then all the Kings and Queens who had come to the christening wished they had stayed away, and they and all the Court fell on their knees and begged Malevola for mercy. As for the three good fairies who were left, they hid behind the window-curtains, and the Court ladies, peeping between their fingers, said—",come christening wish stay fall knee begg mercy good fairy leave hide window curtain court lady peep finger say 
16,“Fancy deserting their godson like this! How unfairy-like!”,fancy desert godson unfairy 
17,"But the Queen and the King only wept, and the Prince played with his rattle and looked at the cat.",goot play rattle look cat 
18,"Then Malevola said mockingly: “Great King and mighty Sovereign, Malevola was not good enough to be asked to your tea-party. But your family shall come down in the world; your son shall marry a kitchen-maid and marry a lady with four feet and no hands.”",say great mighty good ask tea- party family come world son marry kitchen maid marry lady foot hand 
19,"A shiver of horror ran through the room, and Malevola vanished. Then, suddenly, the sun came out, and people lifted up their heads, and dared again to look at each other. And the daisies, too, opened their eyes again.",shiver horror run room vanish sun come person lift head dare look other daisy open eye

22,"“Can’t you do _anything_?” she asked. “Can’t you undo what she says, and make it untrue?”",do ask undo say make untrue 
23,"“Not even a fairy can make a true thing untrue,” said the good fairies sadly. “Malevola’s words will come true; but the Prince has already many gifts, and our gifts are yet to give, and these you shall choose. Whatever you wish shall be his.”",fairy make true thing untrue say good fairy word come true have many gift gift give choose wish 
24,"Then the King, recovering a little from the terror into which the fairy Malevola had thrown him, and remembering how well he and his royal line had always borne them in battle, said at once—",recover little terror fairy throw remember royal line borne battle say 
25,“Let the boy be brave.”,let boy brave 
26,"“He is brave,” said one of the good fairies; “he fears nothing.”",brave say good fairy fear 
27,And at this the Prince ceased to feel any fear of the Palace cat. He put out his hand and pulled her tail so merrily that Pussy turned and clawed the little arm till the blood ran.,cease feel fear cat put hand pull tail turn claw little arm blood run 
28,"“Oh, dear!” cried his mother, “he is fearless, as you say. I wish he were afraid of cats, poor darling.”",dear cry mother fearless say wish afraid cat poor darling 
29,"“He is,” said the second fairy; “you have your wish.” And, indeed, the Prince screamed, and hid his face, and shrank from the Palace cat with such horror that the King pulled out his pencil and note-book and wrote an edict then and there banishing all cats from his dominions. But, all the same, he was very angry.",say second fairy have wish scream hide face shrank cat such horror pull pencil note book write edict banish cat dominion same angry

32,"“He shall be happy,” she said; “he shall have his heart’s desire.”",happy say have heart desire 
33,Then she too vanished; and the Kings and Queens took their leave when their gold coaches came for them. And presently the King and Queen were left alone with the silver hangings and the strewn daisies and the baby.,vanish take leave gold coach come leave alone silver hanging strewn daisy baby 
34,“Oh dear! oh dear!” said the Queen; “this is dreadful! A kitchen-maid!—and a lady with four feet and no hands!”,dear dear say dreadful kitchen maid lady foot hand

40,“Otherwise what?” said the Queen.,say 
41,"“We know nothing about otherwise, do we, my Queen?” he said, catching her round the waist. And in his love for his wife and his son the King felt almost happy again, for here they were all three together, and when your son is in his cradle his marriage seems very far off indeed.",know say catching waist love wife son feel happy son cradle marriage seem 
42,"But the Queen was anxious and frightened, and while the Prince was still a child she sent messengers to the Courts of all the neighbouring Kings and Queens to tell them what had been foretold, which, indeed, most of them knew, having been at the christening. And she begged such of them as had daughters to send them as kitchen-maids, that so the Prince might at least fall in love with a real Princess. And as the Prince grew up he was so handsome and so brave, fearing nothing but cats, which, of course, he never saw, though he dreamed of them often and woke screaming, and also so brilliant and good, that, his father’s kingdom, being beyond compare the finest in all the round world, the young daughters of Kings vied with each other as to who should find favour in the eyes of the Queen-Mother, and so get leave to serve in the kitchen, each nursing the hope that some day the Prince would see her and love her, and perhaps even marry her. And he was very good friends with all the noble kitchen-maids, but he loved none of them, till one day he saw, at a window of the tower where the kitchen was, a bright face and bright hair tied round with a scarlet kerchief. And as he looked at the face it was withdrawn—but the Prince had lost his heart. He kept his secret safe in the place where his heart had been, and schemed and plotted to see this fair lady again; for when he went among the royal kitchen-maids she was not there with them. And he looked morning, noon, and evening, but he never could see her. So then he said—",anxious frighten child send messenger neighbour tell foretell most know christening begg such have daughter send kitchen maid least fall love real grow handsome brave fear cat course see dream wake scream brilliant good father kingdom compare fine round world young daughter vie other find favour eye get leave serve kitchen nurse hope day see love marry good friend noble kitchen maid love day see window tower kitchen bright face bright hair tie scarlet kerchief look face withdraw lose heart keep secret safe place heart scheme plot see fair lady go royal kitchen maid look morning noon evening see say

44,"So he dressed in dark clothes and hid in the shadow of the palace courtyard and watched all one night. And he saw nothing. But in the early morning, when the setting moon and the rising sun were mixing their lights in the sky, he heard a heavy bolt shot back, and the door of the kitchen tower opened slowly. The Prince crouched behind a buttress and watched, and he saw the fair maid with the bright hair under the red kerchief. She swept the doorstep, and she drew water from the well in the middle of the courtyard; and presently he crept to the kitchen window and saw her light the fire and wash the dishes, and make all neat and clean within. And the Prince’s eyes followed her in all she did, and the more he looked at her the more he loved her. And at last he heard sounds as of folks stirring above, so he crept away, keeping close to the wall, and so back to his own rooms. And this he did again on the next morning, and on the next. And on the third morning, as he stood looking through the window at the girl with the bright hair and the bright kerchief, the gold chain he wore clinked against the stone of the window-sill. The maid started, and the bowl she held dropped on to the brick floor of the kitchen and broke into twenty pieces; and then and there she sat down on the floor beside it, and began to cry bitterly.",dress dark clothes hide shadow palace courtyard watch night see early morning setting moon rise sun mix light sky hear heavy bolt shot door kitchen tower open crouch buttress watch see fair maid bright hair red kerchief sweep doorstep draw water middle courtyard creep kitchen window see light fire wash dish make neat clean eye follow more look more love last hear sound folk stir creep keep close wall own room next morning next third morning stand look window girl bright hair bright kerchief gold chain wear clink stone window sill maid start bowl hold drop brick floor kitchen break piece sit floor begin cry

47,"“It isn’t that,” she sobbed, “but now they’ll send me away.”",sobb send 
48,“Who will?”,
49,"“The noble Kitchen-Maids.

50,And she went on crying.,go cry 
51,"“Then you are a Real Kitchen-maid, and not noble at all?” said the Prince.",real maid noble say 
52,She stopped crying for a minute to say “No.”,stop cry minute say 
53,"“Never mind,” said the Prince. “You are twice as pretty as all the Kings’ daughters put together and twenty times as dear.”",mind say pretty daughter put time dear 
54,"At that she stopped crying for good and all, and looked up at him from the floor where she sat.",stop cry good look floor sit 
55,"“Yes you are,” he said, “and I love you with all my heart.”",say love heart 
56,"And with that he caught her in his arms and kissed her; and the Real Kitchen-Maid laid her face against his, and her heart beat wildly, for she knew what the Prince did not, and what, indeed, all the folk knew except the Prince, that this had been foretold at his christening; but she knew also that though he loved her, he was not to marry her, since it was his dreadful destiny to marry some one with four feet and no hands.",catch arm kiss real lay face heart beat know folk know foretell christening know love marry dreadful destiny marry one foot hand

58,“What are you saying?” asked the Prince.,say ask

60,"“And you,” he whispered, “how much do you love me?”",whisper love 
61,"“Oh,” she answered, “I love you better than my right hand and my left.”",answer love good right hand left 
62,"And the Prince thought that a very strange answer. He went through that day in a happy dream; but he did not tell his dream to any one, lest some harm should come to the Real Kitchen-Maid. For he meant to marry her, and he had a feeling that his parents would not approve of the match.",think strange answer go day happy dream tell dream one harm come real mean marry have feeling parent approve match 
63,"Now that night, when the whole palace was asleep, the Real Kitchen-Maid got up and crept out past the sleepy sentinel and went home to her father the farmer and got one of his great white cart horses and rode away through the woods to the cavern where the Great White Rat sits sleeplessly guarding the Magic Cat’s-eye.",night whole palace asleep real get creep sleepy sentinel go father farmer get great white cart horse ride wood cavern great white sit guard eye 
64,"And every one wondered why he guarded it so carefully, for it seemed to have no great value. But the Great White Rat watched it constantly, without ever closing one of those round bright rat’-eyes of his, and when folk sought to lay hands on it he said—",one wonder guard seem have great value great white watch close round bright rat’- eye folk seek lay hand say 
65,“Be careful: it has the power to change you into a mouse.”,careful have power change mouse 
66,"On which folk dropped it hastily and went their ways, leaving him still on guard.",folk drop go way leave guard 
67,"To him now went the little Kitchen-Maid, and asked for help, for he was thousands of years old, and had more wisdom between his nose and ears than all the books in all the world. She told him all that had happened.",go little ask help thousand year old have more wisdom nose ear book world tell happen 
68,"“Now what shall I do?” she said. And the Great White Rat, never shifting his eyes from the Magic Cat’s-eye, answered—",do say great white shift eye eye answer 
69,“Keep your own counsel and be contented. The Prince loves you.”,keep own counsel content love 
70,"“But,” said the Real Kitchen-Maid, “he is not to marry me, but a horrible creature with four feet and no hands.”",say real marry horrible creature foot hand 
71,"“Keep your secret and be content,” the Great White Rat repeated, “and if ever you see him in danger from a lady with four feet and no hands, come straight to me.”",keep secret content great white repeat see danger lady foot hand come 
72,"So the Real Kitchen-Maid went back to the Palace, and set to work to clean pots and pans, for now it was bright dewy daylight, and the night had gone. And before the rest were awake again her Prince came to her and vowed he loved her more than life; so she kept her secret and was content.",real go set work clean pot pan bright dewy daylight night go rest awake come vow love more life keep secret content 
73,"At the time of the Prince’s christening the King had banished all cats from the kingdom, because he could not bear to see his son show fear of anything. But now and then strangers, not knowing of the edict, brought cats to that country, and if the Prince saw one of these cats he was taken with a trembling and a paleness, standing like stone awhile, and presently, with shrieks of terror, fleeing the spot. And it was now a long time since he had seen a cat.",time christening banish cat kingdom bear see son show fear stranger know edict bring cat country see cat take tremble paleness stand stone shriek terror flee spot long time see cat 
74,"Now, soon after the Prince had found out how he loved the Real Kitchen-Maid, his father and mother died suddenly as they were sitting hand in hand, for they loved each other so much that it was not possible for either to stay here without the other.",find love real father mother die sit hand hand love other much possible stay other 
75,"So then the Prince wept bitterly, and would not be comforted, and the Court stood about him with a long face, wearing its new mourning. And as he sat there with his face hidden Something came through the Palace gate and up the marble stairs and into the great hall where the Prince sat on the steps of his father’s throne weeping. And, before the courtiers could draw breath or decide whether it was Court etiquette for them to do anything while the Prince was crying except to stand still and look sad, the creature came up to the Prince and began to rub itself against his arm. And he, still hiding his face, reached out his hand and stroked it!",goot comfort stand long face wear new mourn sit face hide come gate marble stair great hall sit step father throne weep courtier draw breath decide court etiquette do cry stand look sad creature come begin rub arm hide face reach hand stroke 
76,"Then all the Court drew a deep breath, for they saw that the thing that had come in was a great black Cat.",draw deep breath see thing come great black cat 
77,"And the Prince raised his eyes, and they looked to see him shrink and shriek; but instead he passed his hand over the black fur and said—",raise eye look see shrink shriek pass hand black fur say 
78,"“Poor Pussy, then!”",poor pussy 
79,"And at these words the whole Court fled—by window and door. The courtiers took horse, those who had carriages went away in them, those who had none went on foot, and in less than a minute the Prince and the Cat were left alone together.",word whole flead window door courtier take horse have carriage go have go foot less minute cat leave alone 
80,"For the Court was learned in witch law, and knowing the Prince’s horror of cats it saw at once that a cat he was not afraid of was no cat at all, but a witch in that shape. Therefore the courtiers and the whole Royal household fled trembling and hid themselves.",court learn witch law know horror cat see cat afraid cat witch shape courtier whole royal household flead tremble hide 
81,"All but the little Real Kitchen-Maid. She saw with terror that the Cat, or rather the witch in Cat’s shape, had done what no one else could do—roused the Prince from his dull dream of grief. And then she remembered the fate which Malevola had foretold for him—that he should marry a lady with four feet and no hands.",little real see terror cat witch shape do else do rouse dull dream grief remember fate foretell marry lady foot hand 
82,"“Alack-a-day!” she cried. “This witch has four feet and no hands; but she can have hands whenever she chooses, and be a woman by her magic arts as easily as she can be a cat. And then he will love her—and what will become of me? Or, worse, she may marry him only to torment him. She may shut him up in some enchanted dungeon far from the light of day. Such things have happened before now.”",alack day cry witch have foot hand have hand choose woman magic art cat love become bad marry torment shut enchanted dungeon light day such thing happen 
83,"So she stood, hidden by the blue arras, and wrung her hands, and the tears ran down her cheeks. And all the time the black Cat purred to the Prince, and the Prince stroked the black Cat, and any one could have seen that he was every moment becoming more deeply bewitched. And still the Real Kitchen-Maid crouched behind the arras, and her heart ached that it knew no way to save him. Then suddenly she remembered the words of the Great White Rat—",stand hide blue arra wrung hand tear run cheek time black cat purr stroke black cat one see moment become bewitch real crouch arra heart ach know way save remember word great white

85,"Now surely was the time, for the Prince, she knew, was in desperate danger.",time know desperate danger 
86,"The Real Kitchen-Maid crept silently down the marble stairs, but once she was out of the Palace she ran like the wind to the stable. No men were about there—all had followed the example of the Court, and had run away when they heard of the strange coming of the witch-Cat. And of all the many horses that had stood in the stable only one remained, for each man in his fright had saddled the first horse that came to hand and ridden off on it. And the one that still stayed there was the Prince’s own black charger. He had had no mind to be saddled in haste by a stranger, and had turned and bitten the stranger who had attempted it. So he was there alone.",real creep marble stair run wind stable man follow example court run hear strange coming witch cat many horse stand stable remain man fright saddle first horse come hand ride one stay own black charge have mind saddle haste stranger turn bit stranger attempt 
87,"Now the little Kitchen-Maid lifted the Prince’s gold-broidered saddle from its perch, and the weight of it was such that she could not have carried it but for the heavy heart she bore because of her love to the Prince and his danger, and that made all else seem light. She put the saddle on the charger, and the jewelled bridle. And he neighed with pleasure, for he understood, being a horse who could see as far into a stone wall as most people. And when he was saddled he knelt for her to mount, and then up and away like the wind, and she had no need to guide him with the reins, for he found the way and kept it. He galloped steadily on, and the sun went down and the night grew dark, and he went on, and on, and on without stumble or pause, till at moonrise he halted before the house of the Great White Rat.",little lift gold broider saddle perch weight such carry heavy heart bear love danger make else seem light put saddle charge jewell bridle neigh pleasure understand horse see stone wall most person saddle knolt mount wind have need guide rein find way keep gallop sun go night grow dark go stumble pause moonrise halt house great white

89,“For what?”,

97,"And as the great horse galloped back towards the palace in the moonlight, she thought and thought, and at last she said to herself—",great horse gallop palace moonlight think think last say 
98,"“The witch is in cat’s shape, and she must have cat nature, so she will run after a mouse. She will run after _me_, and if I can lead her to a running stream she will leap across it, and then she will have to take her own shape again. That must be what the Great White Rat meant me to do.

100,"When at last, creeping softly on little noiseless feet, the Mouse-Kitchen-Maid re-entered the great hall, she saw that she was only just in time, for the black Cat was purring and looking back at the Prince as she walked, waving her black tail towards the further door of the hall, and the Prince, more bewitched than ever, was slowly following her.",last creep little noiseless foot re-enter great hall see time black cat purr look walk wave black tail further door hall bewitch follow

The Prince understood nothing save that the enchanting black furry creature was leaving him, and in an instant he was alone. He followed to the door, and saw the Cat springing along the passage down the stairs—he followed fast—then along another passage that passed the foot of the back stairs, and he saw that the back stairs were like a water-fall—water was running down in a torrent and meandering away down the brick passage and out into the faint new sunshine.",real utter squeak rush porphyry floor black cat true cat nature leave purr spring good speed make garden run stream feed marble basin royal gold fish live understand enchanting black furry creature leave instant alone follow door see cat spring passage stair follow passage pass foot back stair see back stair water fall water run torrent meander brick passage faint new sunshine 
102,"When the Mouse saw this stream, she thought, “I’m saved.” She never thought of wondering how a stream came to be running down the back stairs of the palace. When she came to think of it afterwards she always believed that the Great White Rat had managed it somehow. She never knew that it was really a great flood from the royal bathroom, where the royal housemaid, in her eagerness to run away from the witch, had left all the royal bath-taps full on.",see stream think save think wonder stream come run back stair palace come think believe great white manage know great flood royal bathroom royal housemaid eagerness run witch leave royal bath tap full 
103,"The Mouse bounded across the stream—the Cat saw the danger, but she could not stop herself.

Then we will go back to the Great White Rat, and you shall be changed into a Princess.”",love lady say hold cheek marry carry wicked fairy prophecy go great white change

I would rather be a mouse with you than a king without you!” And with that he swallowed the Cat’s-eye, and two small mice stood side by side before the Great White Rat. Very kindly he looked at them. Then he pulled a hair from his left whisker and laid it across their little brown backs. And on the instant there stood up a Prince and a Princess and at their feet lay the little empty mouse-skins.",dear little real say save life _are life mouse king swallow cat eye small mouse stand side side great white look pull hair left whisker lay little brown back instant stand foot lay little empty mouse skin

He, when he was a mouse for hers, learned this lesson, which is also the moral of this story: “Nothing is impossible if people only love each other enough.”",bride return palace live happy happy mouse country be cat say good deal course afraid cat curious thing wife afraid learn lesson mouse sake mouse learn lesson moral story impossible person love other
