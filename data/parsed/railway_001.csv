2," They were not railway children to begin with. I don’t suppose they had ever thought about railways except as a means of getting to Maskelyne and Cook’s, the Pantomime, Zoological Gardens, and Madame Tussaud’s. They were just ordinary suburban children, and they lived with their Father and Mother in an ordinary red-brick-fronted villa, with coloured glass in the front door, a tiled passage that was called a hall, a bath-room with hot and cold water, electric bells, French windows, and a good deal of white paint, and ‘every modern convenience’, as the house-agents say.",railway child begin suppose think railway means get zoological ordinary suburban child live ordinary red brick front villa coloured glass front door tile passage call hall bath room hot cold water electric bell french window good deal white paint modern convenience house agent say 
3,"There were three of them. Roberta was the eldest. Of course, Mothers never have favourites, but if their Mother HAD had a favourite, it might have been Roberta. Next came Peter, who wished to be an Engineer when he grew up; and the youngest was Phyllis, who meant extremely well.",be old course mother have favourite mother have favourite come wish engineer grow young mean 
4,"Mother did not spend all her time in paying dull calls to dull ladies, and sitting dully at home waiting for dull ladies to pay calls to her. She was almost always there, ready to play with the children, and read to them, and help them to do their home-lessons. Besides this she used to write stories for them while they were at school, and read them aloud after tea, and she always made up funny pieces of poetry for their birthdays and for other great occasions, such as the christening of the new kittens, or the refurnishing of the doll’s house, or the time when they were getting over the mumps.",mother spend time pay dull call dull lady sit home wait dull lady pay call ready play child read help do home lesson use write story school read tea make funny piece poetry birthday other great occasion such christening new kitten refurnishing doll house time get mump 
5,"These three lucky children always had everything they needed: pretty clothes, good fires, a lovely nursery with heaps of toys, and a Mother Goose wall-paper. They had a kind and merry nursemaid, and a dog who was called James, and who was their very own. They also had a Father who was just perfect--never cross, never unjust, and always ready for a game--at least, if at any time he was NOT ready, he always had an excellent reason for it, and explained the reason to the children so interestingly and funnily that they felt sure he couldn’t help himself.",lucky child have need pretty clothes good fire lovely nursery heap toy mother wall paper have kind merry nursemaid dog call very own have father perfect cross unjust ready game least time ready have excellent reason explain reason child feel sure help 
6,"You will think that they ought to have been very happy. And so they were, but they did not know HOW happy till the pretty life in the Red Villa was over and done with, and they had to live a very different life indeed.",think happy know happy pretty life red do have live different life 
7,The dreadful change came quite suddenly.,dreadful change come

The other presents were full of charm, but the Engine was fuller of charm than any of the others were.",have birthday tenth other present model engine perfect dream other present full charm engine fuller charm other 
9,"Its charm lasted in its full perfection for exactly three days. Then, owing either to Peter’s inexperience or Phyllis’s good intentions, which had been rather pressing, or to some other cause, the Engine suddenly went off with a bang. James was so frightened that he went out and did not come back all day. All the Noah’s Ark people who were in the tender were broken to bits, but nothing else was hurt except the poor little engine and the feelings of Peter. The others said he cried over it--but of course boys of ten do not cry, however terrible the tragedies may be which darken their lot. He said that his eyes were red because he had a cold. This turned out to be true, though Peter did not know it was when he said it, the next day he had to go to bed and stay there. Mother began to be afraid that he might be sickening for measles, when suddenly he sat up in bed and said:",charm last full perfection day ow inexperience good intention press other cause engine go bang frighten go come day person tender break bit else hurt poor little engine feeling other say cry course boy cry terrible tragedy dark lot say eye red have cold turn true know say next day have go bed stay mother begin afraid sicken measle sit bed say

13,"So Mother asked the Cook to make a large pigeon-pie. The pie was made. And when the pie was made, it was cooked. And when it was cooked, Peter ate some of it. After that his cold was better. Mother made a piece of poetry to amuse him while the pie was being made. It began by saying what an unfortunate but worthy boy Peter was, then it went on:",ask cook make large pigeon pie pie make pie make cook cook eat cold good mother make piece poetry amuse pie make begin say unfortunate worthy boy go

21,"Father had been away in the country for three or four days. All Peter’s hopes for the curing of his afflicted Engine were now fixed on his Father, for Father was most wonderfully clever with his fingers. He could mend all sorts of things. He had often acted as veterinary surgeon to the wooden rocking-horse; once he had saved its life when all human aid was despaired of, and the poor creature was given up for lost, and even the carpenter said he didn’t see his way to do anything. And it was Father who mended the doll’s cradle when no one else could; and with a little glue and some bits of wood and a pen-knife made all the Noah’s Ark beasts as strong on their pins as ever they were, if not stronger.",father country day hope curing afflict engine fix clever finger mend sort thing act veterinary surgeon wooden rock horse save life human aid despair poor creature give lose carpenter say see way do mend doll cradle else little glue bit wood pen -knife make beast strong pin strong

The unselfishness was Mother’s idea--but it was Peter who carried it out. And needed a good deal of patience, too.",heroic unselfishness say engine have dinner dinner cigar unselfishness idea carry need good deal patience

42,"Mother tried to make the time pass by telling them a new fairy story about a Princess with green eyes, but it was difficult because they could hear the voices of Father and the gentlemen in the Library, and Father’s voice sounded louder and different to the voice he generally used to people who came about testimonials and holiday funds.",mother try make time pass tell new fairy story green eye difficult hear voice gentleman voice sound louder different voice use person come testimonial holiday fund

48,"Then Mother went into the Library. There was more talking. Then the bell rang again, and Ruth fetched a cab. The children heard boots go out and down the steps. The cab drove away, and the front door shut. Then Mother came in. Her dear face was as white as her lace collar, and her eyes looked very big and shining.

Aunt Emma believed in keeping children in their proper places. And they more than returned the compliment. Their idea of Aunt Emma’s proper place was anywhere where they were not. So they saw very little of her. They preferred the company of the servants, who were more amusing. Cook, if in a good temper, could sing comic songs, and the housemaid, if she happened not to be offended with you, could imitate a hen that has laid an egg, a bottle of champagne being opened, and could mew like two cats fighting. The servants never told the children what the bad news was that the gentlemen had brought to Father.

They only shivered and sneezed and hoped the walk to the new house would not be long. Peter’s nose was colder than he ever remembered it to have been before.
