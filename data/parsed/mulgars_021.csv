1,CHAPTER XXI.,
2," When they could no longer see the hilltop for cloud and mist, Thumb lit a second fire on the isle of rock upon the verge of the cataract, where the water could not scatter on it. But no sign came of Ghibba and his five Moona-men, and Nod began to fret, and could eat no supper, for fear that some evil had overtaken them. But he said nothing, because he knew well enough by now that Thumb had much the same stomach for distrust as himself, though he kept a still tongue in his head, and that it only angered him to be pestered with questions no Mulgar-wit could answer. He sat by the watch-fire in his draggled sheep's-jacket, his hands on his knees, and wished he had lent Ghibba his Wonderstone. ""But no,"" he thought, ""Mutta-matutta bade me 'to no one.' Ghibba is cunning and brave; he will come back.""",see hilltop cloud mist light second fire isle rock verge cataract water scatter sign come man begin fret eat supper fear evil overtake say know have same stomach distrust keep still tongue head anger pester question wit answer sit watch fire draggle sheep jacket hand knee wish loan think bid cunning brave come 
3,"The Men of the Mountains coiled themselves up by the fire. They fear neither for themselves nor for one another. ""We die because we must,"" they say. Yet none the less they raise, as I have said, long ululatory lamentations over their dead, and Nōōmanossi is their enemy as much as any Mulgar's. Thimble, still a little weak and hazy in his head after his sickness, fell quickly asleep; and soon even Thumb, with head wagging from side to side, though he sat bolt upright on his heels in front of the fire, was dozing.",coiled fire fear die say less raise say long ululatory lamentation dead enemy much thimble little weak hazy head sickness fall asleep head wag side side sit bolt heel front fire doze 
4,"Nod alone could not close his eyes. He watched his brother's great face; lower, lower would drop his chin, wheel round, and start up again with a jerk. ""Good dreams, old Thumb,"" he whispered; ""dreams of Salem that bring him near!""",nod close eye watch brother great face low low drop chin wheel start jerk good dream old thumb whisper dream bring 
5,"And all the while that these thoughts were stirring in his head he heard the endless echoing and answering voices of the cataract. Now they seemed the voices of Mulgars quarrelling, shouting, and fighting near and far; and now it seemed as if a thousand thousand birds were singing sweet and shrill beneath the leaves of a great forest. The shadows of the fire danced high. But the night was clear. He could see a great blue star shining right over their thin column of smoke, winding into the air. And now from the ravine into which Ghibba had gone down with his five Moona-men the milk-pale mists began softly to overflow, as if from a pot filled to the brim. If only Ghibba would come back!",while thought stir head hear endless echoing answer voice cataract seem voice quarrell shouting fight seem bird sing sweet shrill leave great forest shadow fire dance high night clear see great blue star shine thin column smoke wind air ravine go man milk pale mist begin overflow pot fill brim come 
6,"Nod scrambled up, and rather warily shuffled past the sleepers over to the other beacon-fire they had kindled. A few strange little night-beasts scuttled away as he drew near, attracted by the warmth of the fire, or even, perhaps, taking refuge in its shine from the night-hunting birds that wheeled and whirred in the air above them. ""Urrckk, urck!"" croaked one, swinging so close that Nod felt the fan of its wings on his cheek. ""Starving Mulgars, urrckk, urck!"" it croaked.",nod scramble shuffle sleeper other beacon fire kindle few strange little night beast scuttle draw attract warmth fire take refuge shine night hunting bird wheel whirr air croak swing close feel fan wing cheek starve croak 
7,"He heaped up the fire. But he could not see a hand's breadth into the ravine. Calm and still the mist lay, and softer than wool. Nod wandered restlessly back, passed again the camping Mulgars, and hobbled across till he came to the rocky bank of the torrent near to where it forked. Here a faint reflection of the flamelight fell, and Nod could see the drowsy fish floating coloured and round-eyed in the sliding water. And while he was standing there, he thought, like the sound of an ooboë singing amid thunder, he seemed to hear on the verge of the roar of the cataract a small wailing voice, not of birds, nor of Mulgars, nor like the phantom music of Tishnar. He crept softly down and along the water-side, under a black and enormous dragon-tree. And beneath the giant sedge he leaned forward his little hairy head, and as his flame-haunted eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, he perceived in the dark-green dusk in which she sat a Water-midden sitting low among the rushes, singing, as if she herself were only music, an odd little water-clear song.",heap fire see hand breadth ravine calm mist lay softer wool wander pass camping hobble come rocky bank torrent fork faint reflection flamelight fall see drowsy fish float coloured eye slide water stand think sound ooboë sing thunder seem hear verge roar cataract small wail voice bird phantom music creep water side black enormous dragon tree giant sedge learn little hairy head flame haunt eye grow accustom gloom perceive dark green dusk sit midden sit low rushe sing music odd little water clear song

12,"Her slim hands, her stooping shoulders, were clear and pale as ivory, and Nod could see in the rosy glimmering of the flames her narrow, beautiful face reflected amid the gold of her hair upon the formless waters. Mutta-matutta once had told Nod a story about the Water-middens whom Tishnar had made beyond all things beautiful, and yet whose beauty had made beyond all things sad. But he could never in the least understand why this was so. When, by the sorcery of his Wonderstone, he had swept all glittering the night before across the jewelled snow, he had never before felt so happy. Why, then, was this Water-midden--by how much more beautiful than he was then!--why was she not happy, too? He peered in his curiosity, with head on one side and blinking eyes, at the Water-midden, and presently, without knowing it, breathed out a long, gruff sigh.",slim hand stooping shoulder clear pale ivory see rosy glimmering flame narrow beautiful face reflect gold hair formless water tell story midden make thing beautiful beauty make thing sad least understand sorcery sweep glitter night jewell snow feel happy midden beautiful happy peer curiosity head side blink eye midden know breathe long gruff sigh 
13,The still Water-midden instantly stayed her singing and looked up at him. Not in the least less fair than the clustering flowers of Tishnar's orchard was her pale startled face. Her eyes were dark as starry night's beneath her narrow brows. She drew her fingers very stealthily across the clear dark water.,midden stay singing look least fair clustering flower orchard pale startle face eye dark starry night narrow brow draw finger clear dark water 
14,"""Are you, then, one of those wild wandering Mulgars that light great fires by night,"" she said, ""and scare all my fishes from sleeping?""",wild wonder light great fire night say scare fish sleep 
15,"""Yes, Midden; I and my brothers,"" said Nod. ""We light fires because we are cold and hungry. We are wanderers; that is true. But 'wild'--I know not.""",brother say light fire cold hungry wanderer true wild know

17,"Nod laughed. ""It was a pleasant coat when it was new, Midden, but we are old friends now--it and me. And though it keeps me warm enough marching by day, when night comes, and this never-to-be-forgotten frost sharpens, my bones begin to ache, as did my mother's before me, whose grave not even Kush can see.""",nod laugh pleasant coat new old friend keep warm march day night come forget frost sharpen bone begin ache mother grave see

19,"""We have come,"" said Nod, ""from beyond all Munza-mulgar, that lies on the other side of the river of the saffron-fearing Coccadrilloes--that is, many score leagues southward of Arakkaboa--and we go to our Uncle, King Assasimmon, Prince of the Valleys of Tishnar--that is, if that Mountain-prince, my friend Ghibba, can find us a way.""",come say mulgar lie other side river saffron fear many score league go prince friend find way 
20,"The Water-midden looked at Nod, and drew softly, slowly back her smooth gold locks from the slippery water. ""The Mulla-mulgar, then, has seen great dangers?"" she said. ""He is very young and little to have travelled so far.""",midden look draw smooth gold lock slippery water mulgar see great danger say young little travel

22,"""Tell me why that is,"" she said, leaning out of her heavy hair.",tell say lean heavy hair

34,"""Carry with you?"" said she.",carry say 
35,"""Oh, only the Wonderstone,"" said Nod.",say 
36,"Then the Water-midden lifted both her hands, and scattered back her long pale locks over her narrow shoulders. ""The Wonderstone? What, then, is that?""",midden lift hand scatter long pale lock narrow shoulder

39,"Nod turned away, glancing over his shoulder to where, leaning amid the stars, hung the distant darkness of Mulgarmeerez. He slowly unfastened his ivory-buttoned pocket and groped for the Wonderstone. Holding it tight in his bare brown palm, he scrambled down a little nearer to the water, and unlatched his fingers to show it to the Midden. But now, to his astonishment, instead of glooming pale as a little moon, it burned angry as Antares.",nod turn glance shoulder lean star hang distant darkness unfasten ivory button pocket grope holding bare brown palm scramble little nearer water unlatch finger show astonishment gloom pale little moon burn angry 
40,"The Water-midden peeped out between her hair, and laughed and clapped her hands. ""Oh, but if I might but hold it in my hand one moment, I think that I should never even sigh again!"" said she.

47,"""I do not think so, most beautiful Midden,"" Nod said. ""Show me your fingers, and let me see.""",think beautiful say show finger let see 
48,"Both sly tiny hands, colder than ice-water, the beautiful Water-midden outstretched towards him. He gazed, stooping out of his ugliness, into those eyes whose darkness was only shadowy green, clearer than the mountain-water. For an instant he waited, then he shut his eyes and put the burning Wonderstone into those two small icy hands. ""Return it to me quickly--quickly, Midden, or Tishnar will be angered against me. How must the Meermut of my mother now be mourning!""",sly tiny hand cold ice water beautiful water midden outstretch gaze stoop ugliness eye darkness shadowy green clear mountain water instant wait shut eye put burn small icy hand return anger mother mourn 
49,"But the Midden had drawn back amid the reeds, holding tight the ruby-red stone in her small hands, and her eyes looked all darkened and slant, and her small scarlet mouth was curled. ""Can you not trust me but a moment, Prince of the Mulgars?""",draw reed hold tight ruby red stone small hand eye look darken slant small scarlet mouth curl trust moment

56,"There was a sudden pale and golden swirl of water. A light as of amber floated an instant on the dark, gliding clearness of the torrent. Nod stood up dazed and trembling. The Water-midden was gone. His eyes glanced to and fro. Desolate and strange rose Tishnar's peak. He felt small and afraid in the silence of the mountains. And again broke out, hollow and mournful, Thumb's voice calling him. Nod hobbled and hid himself behind a tree. Then from tree to tree he scurried in, hiding under great ropes of Cullum and Samarak, until at last, as if he had been wandering in the forest, he came out from behind Thumb.",be sudden pale golden swirl water light amber float instant dark glide clearness torrent nod stand dazed tremble midden gone eye glance for desolate strange rise peak feel small afraid silence mountain break hollow mournful voice call hobble hide tree tree tree scurry hide great rope last wonder forest come

58,"Thumb's eyes gladdened, but his face looked black and louring. ""Why do you play such Munza tricks,"" he said--""hiding from us in the night?

59,"Nod burned with shame and rage at his jeers, but he felt too miserable to answer him. He followed slowly after his brother, his small, lean, hungry hand thrust deep into his empty pocket.

What evil did I do to you that you should have stolen my Wonderstone?""",nod burn shame rage jeer feel miserable answer follow brother small lean hungry hand thrust empty pocket keep say false evil do steal 
60,"A thick grey curtain hung over the night, though daybreak must be near. A few heavy hailstones scattered down through the still branches. And athwart Mōōt and Mulgarmeerez a distant thunder rolled. ""Follow quick, Walk-by-night,"" said Thumb; ""a storm is brewing.""",thick grey curtain hang night daybreak few heavy hailstone scatter still branch athwart distant thunder roll follow quick walk night say storm brew 
61,"The men of the Mountains were all awake, squatting like grasshoppers, and gossiping together close about their watch-fire. Wind swept from the mountain-snows, swirling sparks into the air, and streamed moaning into the ravines. And soon lightning glimmered blue and wan across the roaring clouds of hail, and lit the enormous hills with glimpses of their everlasting snows. The travellers sheltered themselves as best they could, crouched close to the ground. Nod threw himself down and drew his sheep-skin over his head. His heart was beating thick and fast. He could think of nothing but his stolen Wonderstone and the dark eyes of the yellow-haired Water-midden. ""Tishnar is angry--Tishnar is angry,"" he kept whispering, beneath the roar of the hail. ""She has forsaken me, Noddle of Pork that Nod is.""",man awake squat grasshopper gossipe close watch fire wind sweep mountain snow swirl spark air stream moan ravine lightning glimmer blue want roar cloud hail light enormous hill glimpse everlasting snow traveller shelter good crouch ground throw draw sheep skin head heart beat thick fast think steal dark eye yellow haired water midden angry angry keep whisper roar hail forsaken
