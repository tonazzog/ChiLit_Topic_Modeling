1,CHAPTER IV. MR. BADGER,
2,"THEY waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in the snow to keep their feet warm. At last they heard the sound of slow shuffling footsteps approaching the door from the inside. It seemed, as the Mole remarked to the Rat, like some one walking in carpet slippers that were too large for him and down at heel; which was intelligent of Mole, because that was exactly what it was.",wait seem long time stamp snow keep foot warm last hear sound slow shuffle footstep approach door inside seem remark one walking carpet slipper large heel intelligent 
3,"There was the noise of a bolt shot back, and the door opened a few inches, enough to show a long snout and a pair of sleepy blinking eyes.",be noise bolt shot door open few inch show long snout pair sleepy blinking eye

5,"‘Oh, Badger,’ cried the Rat, ‘let us in, please. It’s me, Rat, and my friend Mole, and we’ve lost our way in the snow.’",cry let friend lose way snow 
6,"‘What, Ratty, my dear little man!’ exclaimed the Badger, in quite a different voice. ‘Come along in, both of you, at once. Why, you must be perished. Well I never! Lost in the snow! And in the Wild Wood, too, and at this time of night! But come in with you.’",dear little man exclaim different voice come perish lose snow wild time night come 
7,"The two animals tumbled over each other in their eagerness to get inside, and heard the door shut behind them with great joy and relief.",animal tumble other eagerness get hear door shut great joy relief 
8,"The Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were indeed very down at heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had probably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked kindly down on them and patted both their heads. ‘This is not the sort of night for small animals to be out,’ he said paternally. ‘I’m afraid you’ve been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along; come into the kitchen. There’s a first-rate fire there, and supper and everything.’",wear long dress gown slipper heel carry flat candlestick paw way bed summons sound look patt head sort night small animal say afraid prank come come kitchen be first rate fire supper 
9,"He shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed him, nudging each other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long, gloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort of a central hall; out of which they could dimly see other long tunnel-like passages branching, passages mysterious and without apparent end. But there were doors in the hall as well--stout oaken comfortable-looking doors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found themselves in all the glow and warmth of a large fire-lit kitchen.",shuffle front carry light follow nudge other anticipate sort way long gloomy tell truth shabby passage sort central hall see other long tunnel like passage branch passage mysterious apparent end be door hall stout oaken comfortable look door flung open find glow warmth large fire light kitchen 
10,"The floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire of logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the wall, well out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed settles, facing each other on either side of the fire, gave further sitting accommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the room stood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with benches down each side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood pushed back, were spread the remains of the Badger’s plain but ample supper. Rows of spotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser at the far end of the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams, bundles of dried herbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed a place where heroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary harvesters could line up in scores along the table and keep their Harvest Home with mirth and song, or where two or three friends of simple tastes could sit about as they pleased and eat and smoke and talk in comfort and contentment. The ruddy brick floor smiled up at the smoky ceiling; the oaken settles, shiny with long wear, exchanged cheerful glances with each other; plates on the dresser grinned at pots on the shelf, and the merry firelight flickered and played over everything without distinction.",floor wear red brick wide hearth burn fire log attractive chimney corner tuck wall suspicion draught couple high back settle face other side fire give further sitting accommodation dispose middle room stand long table plain board place trestle bench side end arm chair stand push spread remains plain ample supper row spotless plate wink shelf dresser far end room rafter overhead hang ham bundle dry herb net onion basket egg seem place hero feast victory weary harvester line score table keep mirth song friend simple taste sit pleased eat smoke talk comfort contentment ruddy brick floor smile smoky ceiling oaken settle shiny long wear exchange cheerful glance other plate dresser grin pot shelf merry firelight flicker play distinction 
11,"The kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves at the fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he fetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole’s shin with warm water and mended the cut with sticking-plaster till the whole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing light and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in front of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on the table behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe anchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside was miles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a half-forgotten dream.",kindly thrust settle toast fire bid remove wet coat boot fetched dress gown slipper bath shin warm water mend cut stick plaster whole thing good new good embrace light warmth warm dry last weary leg proppe front suggestive clink plate arrange table seem storm drive animal safe anchorage cold trackless wild leave mile mile suffer half forget dream 
12,"When at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to the table, where he had been busy laying a repast. They had felt pretty hungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was spread for them, really it seemed only a question of what they should attack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other things would obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them attention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it was slowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that results from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that sort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the table, or everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society himself, he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didn’t really matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and took too narrow a view; because they do matter very much, though it would take too long to explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the head of the table, and nodded gravely at intervals as the animals told their story; and he did not seem surprised or shocked at anything, and he never said, ‘I told you so,’ or, ‘Just what I always said,’ or remarked that they ought to have done so-and-so, or ought not to have done something else. The Mole began to feel very friendly towards him.",last toast summon table busy lay repast feel hungry see supper spread seem question attack attractive other thing wait have time give attention conversation impossible long time resume regrettable sort conversation result talk mouth full mind sort thing take notice elbow table speak go get idea thing belong thing matter know course wrong take narrow view matter take explain sit arm chair head table nod interval animal tell story seem surprise shocked say tell say remark do do else begin feel friendly 
13,"When supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his skin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he didn’t care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the glowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to be sitting up SO late, and SO independent, and SO full; and after they had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said heartily, ‘Now then! tell us the news from your part of the world. How’s old Toad going on?’",supper finish last animal feel skin tight safe time care hang gather glow ember great wood fire think jolly sit late independent full chate time thing general say tell news part world old toad go 
14,"‘Oh, from bad to worse,’ said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked up on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his head, tried to look properly mournful. ‘Another smash-up only last week, and a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and he’s hopelessly incapable. If he’d only employ a decent, steady, well-trained animal, pay him good wages, and leave everything to him, he’d get on all right. But no; he’s convinced he’s a heaven-born driver, and nobody can teach him anything; and all the rest follows.’",bad bad say cocked settle bask firelight heel high head try look mournful smash last week bad one see insist drive incapable employ decent steady train animal pay good wage leave get right convince heaven bear driver teach rest follow 
15,‘How many has he had?’ inquired the Badger gloomily.,many have inquire 
16,"‘Smashes, or machines?’ asked the Rat. ‘Oh, well, after all, it’s the same thing--with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others--you know that coach-house of his? Well, it’s piled up--literally piled up to the roof--with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat! That accounts for the other six--so far as they can be accounted for.’",smashe machine ask same thing seventh other know coach house pile pile roof fragment motor car big hat account other account 
17,"‘He’s been in hospital three times,’ put in the Mole; ‘and as for the fines he’s had to pay, it’s simply awful to think of.’",hospital time put fine have pay awful think 
18,"‘Yes, and that’s part of the trouble,’ continued the Rat. ‘Toad’s rich, we all know; but he’s not a millionaire. And he’s a hopelessly bad driver, and quite regardless of law and order. Killed or ruined--it’s got to be one of the two things, sooner or later. Badger! we’re his friends--oughtn’t we to do something?’",part trouble continue rich know millionaire bad driver law order kill ruin get thing friend do 
19,"The Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. ‘Now look here!’ he said at last, rather severely; ‘of course you know I can’t do anything NOW?’",go bit hard thinking look say last course know do 
20,"His two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal, according to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do anything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the off-season of winter. All are sleepy--some actually asleep. All are weather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and nights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and every energy kept at full stretch.",friend assent understand point animal accord rule animal etiquette expect do strenuous heroic active off season winter sleepy asleep weather bound more less rest arduous day night muscle test energy keep full stretch 
21,"‘Very well then!’ continued the Badger. ‘BUT, when once the year has really turned, and the nights are shorter, and halfway through them one rouses and feels fidgety and wanting to be up and doing by sunrise, if not before--YOU know!----’",continue year turn night short rouse feel fidgety want do sunrise know 
22,Both animals nodded gravely. THEY knew!,animal nod know 
23,"‘Well, THEN,’ went on the Badger, ‘we--that is, you and me and our friend the Mole here--we’ll take Toad seriously in hand. We’ll stand no nonsense whatever. We’ll bring him back to reason, by force if need be. We’ll MAKE him be a sensible Toad. We’ll--you’re asleep, Rat!’",go friend take hand stand nonsense bring reason force need make sensible toad asleep 
24,"‘Not me!’ said the Rat, waking up with a jerk.",say wake jerk 
25,"‘He’s been asleep two or three times since supper,’ said the Mole, laughing. He himself was feeling quite wakeful and even lively, though he didn’t know why. The reason was, of course, that he being naturally an underground animal by birth and breeding, the situation of Badger’s house exactly suited him and made him feel at home; while the Rat, who slept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened on a breezy river, naturally felt the atmosphere still and oppressive.",asleep time supper say laugh feel wakeful lively know reason course underground animal birth breeding situation house suit make feel home sleep night bedroom window open breezy river feel atmosphere oppressive 
26,"‘Well, it’s time we were all in bed,’ said the Badger, getting up and fetching flat candlesticks. ‘Come along, you two, and I’ll show you your quarters. And take your time tomorrow morning--breakfast at any hour you please!’",time bed say get fetch flat candlestick come show quarter take time tomorrow morning breakfast hour 
27,"He conducted the two animals to a long room that seemed half bedchamber and half loft. The Badger’s winter stores, which indeed were visible everywhere, took up half the room--piles of apples, turnips, and potatoes, baskets full of nuts, and jars of honey; but the two little white beds on the remainder of the floor looked soft and inviting, and the linen on them, though coarse, was clean and smelt beautifully of lavender; and the Mole and the Water Rat, shaking off their garments in some thirty seconds, tumbled in between the sheets in great joy and contentment.",conduct animal long room seem half bedchamber half loft winter store visible take room pile apple turnip potato basket full nut jar honey little white bed remainder floor look soft invite linen coarse clean smell lavender shake garment second tumble sheet great joy contentment 
28,"In accordance with the kindly Badger’s injunctions, the two tired animals came down to breakfast very late next morning, and found a bright fire burning in the kitchen, and two young hedgehogs sitting on a bench at the table, eating oatmeal porridge out of wooden bowls. The hedgehogs dropped their spoons, rose to their feet, and ducked their heads respectfully as the two entered.",accordance kindly injunction tired animal come breakfast next morning find bright fire burn kitchen young hedgehog sit bench table eat oatmeal porridge wooden bowl hedgehog drop spoon rise foot duck head enter 
29,"‘There, sit down, sit down,’ said the Rat pleasantly, ‘and go on with your porridge. Where have you youngsters come from? Lost your way in the snow, I suppose?’",sit sit say go porridge youngster come lose way snow suppose 
30,"‘Yes, please, sir,’ said the elder of the two hedgehogs respectfully. ‘Me and little Billy here, we was trying to find our way to school--mother WOULD have us go, was the weather ever so--and of course we lost ourselves, sir, and Billy he got frightened and took and cried, being young and faint-hearted. And at last we happened up against Mr. Badger’s back door, and made so bold as to knock, sir, for Mr. Badger he’s a kind-hearted gentleman, as everyone knows----’",sir say elder hedgehog little try find way school mother have go weather course lose sir frighten take cry young faint hearted last happen back door make bold knock sir kind hearted gentleman know

32,"‘O, terrible bad, sir, terrible deep the snow is,’ said the hedgehog. ‘No getting out for the likes of you gentlemen to-day.’",terrible bad sir terrible deep snow say hedgehog get like gentleman day 
33,"‘Where’s Mr. Badger?’ inquired the Mole, as he warmed the coffee-pot before the fire.",inquire warm coffee pot fire 
34,"‘The master’s gone into his study, sir,’ replied the hedgehog, ‘and he said as how he was going to be particular busy this morning, and on no account was he to be disturbed.’",master go study sir reply hedgehog say go particular busy morning account disturb 
35,"This explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood by every one present. The fact is, as already set forth, when you live a life of intense activity for six months in the year, and of comparative or actual somnolence for the other six, during the latter period you cannot be continually pleading sleepiness when there are people about or things to be done. The excuse gets monotonous. The animals well knew that Badger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had retired to his study and settled himself in an arm-chair with his legs up on another and a red cotton handkerchief over his face, and was being ‘busy’ in the usual way at this time of the year.",explanation course understand one present fact set live life intense activity month year comparative actual somnolence other latter period plead sleepiness be person thing do excuse get monotonous animal know eat hearty breakfast retire study settle arm chair leg red cotton handkerchief face busy usual way time year 
36,"The front-door bell clanged loudly, and the Rat, who was very greasy with buttered toast, sent Billy, the smaller hedgehog, to see who it might be. There was a sound of much stamping in the hall, and presently Billy returned in front of the Otter, who threw himself on the Rat with an embrace and a shout of affectionate greeting.",front door bell clange greasy butter toast send small hedgehog see be sound much stamp hall return front throw embrace shout affectionate greeting 
37,"‘Get off!’ spluttered the Rat, with his mouth full.",get splutter mouth full 
38,"‘Thought I should find you here all right,’ said the Otter cheerfully. ‘They were all in a great state of alarm along River Bank when I arrived this morning. Rat never been home all night--nor Mole either--something dreadful must have happened, they said; and the snow had covered up all your tracks, of course. But I knew that when people were in any fix they mostly went to Badger, or else Badger got to know of it somehow, so I came straight off here, through the Wild Wood and the snow! My! it was fine, coming through the snow as the red sun was rising and showing against the black tree-trunks! As you went along in the stillness, every now and then masses of snow slid off the branches suddenly with a flop! making you jump and run for cover. Snow-castles and snow-caverns had sprung up out of nowhere in the night--and snow bridges, terraces, ramparts--I could have stayed and played with them for hours. Here and there great branches had been torn away by the sheer weight of the snow, and robins perched and hopped on them in their perky conceited way, just as if they had done it themselves. A ragged string of wild geese passed overhead, high on the grey sky, and a few rooks whirled over the trees, inspected, and flapped off homewards with a disgusted expression; but I met no sensible being to ask the news of. About halfway across I came on a rabbit sitting on a stump, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He was a pretty scared animal when I crept up behind him and placed a heavy forepaw on his shoulder. I had to cuff his head once or twice to get any sense out of it at all. At last I managed to extract from him that Mole had been seen in the Wild Wood last night by one of them. It was the talk of the burrows, he said, how Mole, Mr. Rat’s particular friend, was in a bad fix; how he had lost his way, and “They” were up and out hunting, and were chivvying him round and round. “Then why didn’t any of you DO something?” I asked. “You mayn’t be blest with brains, but there are hundreds and hundreds of you, big, stout fellows, as fat as butter, and your burrows running in all directions, and you could have taken him in and made him safe and comfortable, or tried to, at all events.”  “What, US?” he merely said: “DO something? us rabbits?” So I cuffed him again and left him. There was nothing else to be done. At any rate, I had learnt something; and if I had had the luck to meet any of “Them”  I’d have learnt something more--or THEY would.’",think find say great state alarm arrive morning night dreadful happen say snow cover track course know person fix go get know come wild snow fine come snow red sun rise show black tree trunk go stillness mass snow slide branch flop make jump run cover snow castle snow cavern spring night snow bridge terrace rampart stay play hour great branch tear sheer weight snow robin perch hopp perky conceited way do ragged string wild geese pass high grey sky few rook whirl tree inspect flapp homeward disgusted expression meet sensible being ask news come rabbit sit stump clean silly face paw scared animal creep place heavy forepaw shoulder have cuff head get sense last manage extract see wild last night talk burrow say particular friend bad fix lose way hunt chivvy do ask good brain be hundred hundred big stout fellow fat butter burrow run direction take make safe comfortable try event say do rabbit cuff leave be else do rate learn have luck meet learn more 
39,"‘Weren’t you at all--er--nervous?’ asked the Mole, some of yesterday’s terror coming back to him at the mention of the Wild Wood.",er nervous ask yesterday terror come mention wild 
40,"‘Nervous?’ The Otter showed a gleaming set of strong white teeth as he laughed. ‘I’d give ‘em nerves if any of them tried anything on with me. Here, Mole, fry me some slices of ham, like the good little chap you are. I’m frightfully hungry, and I’ve got any amount to say to Ratty here. Haven’t seen him for an age.’",nervous show gleam set strong white tooth laugh give nerve try fry slice ham good little chap hungry get amount say see age 
41,"So the good-natured Mole, having cut some slices of ham, set the hedgehogs to fry it, and returned to his own breakfast, while the Otter and the Rat, their heads together, eagerly talked river-shop, which is long shop and talk that is endless, running on like the babbling river itself.",good natured cut slice ham set hedgehog fry return own breakfast head talk river shop long shop talk endless run babble river 
42,"A plate of fried ham had just been cleared and sent back for more, when the Badger entered, yawning and rubbing his eyes, and greeted them all in his quiet, simple way, with kind enquiries for every one. ‘It must be getting on for luncheon time,’ he remarked to the Otter. ‘Better stop and have it with us. You must be hungry, this cold morning.’",plate fry ham clear send more enter yawn rub eye greet quiet simple way kind enquiry one get luncheon time remark stop have hungry cold morning 
43,"‘Rather!’ replied the Otter, winking at the Mole. ‘The sight of these greedy young hedgehogs stuffing themselves with fried ham makes me feel positively famished.’",reply wink sight greedy young hedgehog stuff fry ham make feel famish 
44,"The hedgehogs, who were just beginning to feel hungry again after their porridge, and after working so hard at their frying, looked timidly up at Mr. Badger, but were too shy to say anything.",hedgehog begin feel hungry porridge work frying look shy say 
45,"‘Here, you two youngsters be off home to your mother,’ said the Badger kindly. ‘I’ll send some one with you to show you the way. You won’t want any dinner to-day, I’ll be bound.’",youngster mother say send one show way want dinner day bind 
46,"He gave them sixpence apiece and a pat on the head, and they went off with much respectful swinging of caps and touching of forelocks.",give apiece pat head go respectful swing cap touch forelock 
47,"Presently they all sat down to luncheon together. The Mole found himself placed next to Mr. Badger, and, as the other two were still deep in river-gossip from which nothing could divert them, he took the opportunity to tell Badger how comfortable and home-like it all felt to him. ‘Once well underground,’ he said, ‘you know exactly where you are. Nothing can happen to you, and nothing can get at you. You’re entirely your own master, and you don’t have to consult anybody or mind what they say. Things go on all the same overhead, and you let ‘em, and don’t bother about ‘em. When you want to, up you go, and there the things are, waiting for you.’",sit luncheon find place other deep river gossip divert take opportunity tell comfortable home feel underground say know happen get own master have consult mind say thing go same overhead let bother want go thing wait 
48,"The Badger simply beamed on him. ‘That’s exactly what I say,’ he replied. ‘There’s no security, or peace and tranquillity, except underground. And then, if your ideas get larger and you want to expand--why, a dig and a scrape, and there you are! If you feel your house is a bit too big, you stop up a hole or two, and there you are again! No builders, no tradesmen, no remarks passed on you by fellows looking over your wall, and, above all, no WEATHER. Look at Rat, now. A couple of feet of flood water, and he’s got to move into hired lodgings; uncomfortable, inconveniently situated, and horribly expensive. Take Toad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best house in these parts, AS a house. But supposing a fire breaks out--where’s Toad? Supposing tiles are blown off, or walls sink or crack, or windows get broken--where’s Toad? Supposing the rooms are draughty--I HATE a draught myself--where’s Toad? No, up and out of doors is good enough to roam about and get one’s living in; but underground to come back to at last--that’s my idea of HOME.’",beam say reply be security peace tranquillity underground idea get large want expand dig scrape feel house bit big stop hole builder tradesmen remark pass fellow look wall weather look couple foot flood water get move hire lodging uncomfortable situate expensive take say good house part house suppose fire break suppose tile blow wall sink crack window break suppose room draughty hate draught door good roam get live underground come last idea 
49,"The Mole assented heartily; and the Badger in consequence got very friendly with him. ‘When lunch is over,’ he said, ‘I’ll take you all round this little place of mine. I can see you’ll appreciate it. You understand what domestic architecture ought to be, you do.’",assent consequence get friendly lunch say take little place see appreciate understand domestic architecture 
50,"After luncheon, accordingly, when the other two had settled themselves into the chimney-corner and had started a heated argument on the subject of EELS, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole follow him. Crossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal tunnels, and the wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either side of rooms both large and small, some mere cupboards, others nearly as broad and imposing as Toad’s dining-hall. A narrow passage at right angles led them into another corridor, and here the same thing was repeated. The Mole was staggered at the size, the extent, the ramifications of it all; at the length of the dim passages, the solid vaultings of the crammed store-chambers, the masonry everywhere, the pillars, the arches, the pavements. ‘How on earth, Badger,’ he said at last, ‘did you ever find time and strength to do all this? It’s astonishing!’",luncheon other settle chimney corner start heat argument subject light lantern bid follow cross hall pass principal tunnel waver light lantern give glimpse side room large small mere cupboard other broad imposing dining hall narrow passage right angle lead corridor same thing repeat stagger size extent ramification length dim passage solid vaulting cramm store chamber masonry pillar arche pavement earth say last find time strength do astonish 
51,"‘It WOULD be astonishing indeed,’ said the Badger simply, ‘if I HAD done it. But as a matter of fact I did none of it--only cleaned out the passages and chambers, as far as I had need of them. There’s lots more of it, all round about. I see you don’t understand, and I must explain it to you. Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves now, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is, there was a city--a city of people, you know. Here, where we are standing, they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on their business. Here they stabled their horses and feasted, from here they rode out to fight or drove out to trade. They were a powerful people, and rich, and great builders. They built to last, for they thought their city would last for ever.’",astonish say do matter fact do clean passage chamber need be lot more see understand explain spot wild wave plant grow be city city person know stand live walk talk sleep carry business stabl horse feast ride fight drive trade powerful person rich great builder build last think city last 
52,‘But what has become of them all?’ asked the Mole.,become ask 
53,"‘Who can tell?’ said the Badger. ‘People come--they stay for a while, they flourish, they build--and they go. It is their way. But we remain. There were badgers here, I’ve been told, long before that same city ever came to be. And now there are badgers here again. We are an enduring lot, and we may move out for a time, but we wait, and are patient, and back we come.

55,"‘When they went,’ continued the Badger, ‘the strong winds and persistent rains took the matter in hand, patiently, ceaselessly, year after year. Perhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a little--who knows? It was all down, down, down, gradually--ruin and levelling and disappearance. Then it was all up, up, up, gradually, as seeds grew to saplings, and saplings to forest trees, and bramble and fern came creeping in to help. Leaf-mould rose and obliterated, streams in their winter freshets brought sand and soil to clog and to cover, and in course of time our home was ready for us again, and we moved in. Up above us, on the surface, the same thing happened. Animals arrived, liked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down, spread, and flourished. They didn’t bother themselves about the past--they never do; they’re too busy. The place was a bit humpy and hillocky, naturally, and full of holes; but that was rather an advantage. And they don’t bother about the future, either--the future when perhaps the people will move in again--for a time--as may very well be. The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual lot, good, bad, and indifferent--I name no names. It takes all sorts to make a world. But I fancy you know something about them yourself by this time.’",go continue strong wind persistent rain take matter hand year year badger small way help little know ruin levelling disappearance seed grow sapling sapling forest tree bramble fern come creep help leaf mould rise obliterate stream winter freshet bring sand soil clog cover course time home ready move surface same thing happen animal arrive like look place take quarter settle spread flourish bother past busy place bit humpy hillocky full hole advantage bother future future person move time wild populate usual lot good bad indifferent name name take sort make world fancy know time

58,"When they got back to the kitchen again, they found the Rat walking up and down, very restless. The underground atmosphere was oppressing him and getting on his nerves, and he seemed really to be afraid that the river would run away if he wasn’t there to look after it. So he had his overcoat on, and his pistols thrust into his belt again. ‘Come along, Mole,’ he said anxiously, as soon as he caught sight of them. ‘We must get off while it’s daylight. Don’t want to spend another night in the Wild Wood again.’",get kitchen find walk restless underground atmosphere oppress get nerve seem afraid river run look have overcoat pistol thrust belt come say catch sight get daylight want spend night wild

60,"‘You really needn’t fret, Ratty,’ added the Badger placidly. ‘My passages run further than you think, and I’ve bolt-holes to the edge of the wood in several directions, though I don’t care for everybody to know about them. When you really have to go, you shall leave by one of my short cuts. Meantime, make yourself easy, and sit down again.’",fret add passage run think bolt hole edge wood several direction care know have go leave short cut make easy sit 
61,"The Rat was nevertheless still anxious to be off and attend to his river, so the Badger, taking up his lantern again, led the way along a damp and airless tunnel that wound and dipped, part vaulted, part hewn through solid rock, for a weary distance that seemed to be miles. At last daylight began to show itself confusedly through tangled growth overhanging the mouth of the passage; and the Badger, bidding them a hasty good-bye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening, made everything look as natural as possible again, with creepers, brushwood, and dead leaves, and retreated.",anxious attend river take lantern lead way damp airless tunnel wind dip part vault part hewn solid rock weary distance seem mile last daylight begin show tangle growth overhang mouth passage bid hasty good bye push opening make look natural possible creeper brushwood dead leave retreat
