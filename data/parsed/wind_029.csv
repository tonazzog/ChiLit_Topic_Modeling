2," THE children were delighted with the story, and made many amusing remarks upon it. Mr. Raymond promised to search his brain for another, and when he had found one to bring it to them. Diamond having taken leave of Nanny, and promised to go and see her again soon, went away with him.",child delight story make many amusing remark promise search brain find bring diamond take leave promise go see go 
3,"Now Mr. Raymond had been turning over in his mind what he could do both for Diamond and for Nanny. He had therefore made some acquaintance with Diamond’s father, and had been greatly pleased with him. But he had come to the resolution, before he did anything so good as he would like to do for them, to put them all to a certain test. So as they walked away together, he began to talk with Diamond as follows:--",turn mind do make acquaintance father pleased come resolution do good like do put certain test walk begin talk follow 
4,"“Nanny must leave the hospital soon, Diamond.”",leave hospital 
5,"“I’m glad of that, sir.”",glad sir 
6,“Why? Don’t you think it’s a nice place?”,think nice place 
7,"“Yes, very. But it’s better to be well and doing something, you know, even if it’s not quite so comfortable.”",good do know comfortable 
8,"“But they can’t keep Nanny so long as they would like. They can’t keep her till she’s quite strong. There are always so many sick children they want to take in and make better. And the question is, What will she do when they send her out again?”",keep like keep strong be many sick child want take make good question do send 
9,"“That’s just what I can’t tell, though I’ve been thinking of it over and over, sir. Her crossing was taken long ago, and I couldn’t bear to see Nanny fighting for it, especially with such a poor fellow as has taken it. He’s quite lame, sir.”",tell think sir crossing take bear see fight poor fellow take lame sir 
10,"“She doesn’t look much like fighting, now, does she, Diamond?”",look fight 
11,"“No, sir. She looks too like an angel. Angels don’t fight--do they, sir?”",sir look angel angel fight sir 
12,"“Not to get things for themselves, at least,” said Mr. Raymond.",get thing least say 
13,"“Besides,” added Diamond, “I don’t quite see that she would have any better right to the crossing than the boy who has got it. Nobody gave it to her; she only took it. And now he has taken it.”",add see have good right crossing boy get give take take 
14,"“If she were to sweep a crossing--soon at least--after the illness she has had, she would be laid up again the very first wet day,” said Mr. Raymond.",sweep crossing least illness have lay very first wet day say 
15,"“And there’s hardly any money to be got except on the wet days,”  remarked Diamond reflectively. “Is there nothing else she could do, sir?”",be money get wet day remark be else do sir 
16,"“Not without being taught, I’m afraid.”",teach afraid 
17,"“Well, couldn’t somebody teach her something?”",teach 
18,"“Couldn’t you teach her, Diamond?”",teach 
19,"“I don’t know anything myself, sir. I could teach her to dress the baby; but nobody would give her anything for doing things like that: they are so easy. There wouldn’t be much good in teaching her to drive a cab, for where would she get the cab to drive? There ain’t fathers and old Diamonds everywhere. At least poor Nanny can’t find any of them, I doubt.”",know sir teach dress baby give do thing easy be much good teach drive cab get cab drive father old diamond least poor find doubt 
20,"“Perhaps if she were taught to be nice and clean, and only speak gentle words.”",teach nice clean speak gentle word 
21,"“Mother could teach her that,” interrupted Diamond.",mother teach interrupt 
22,"“And to dress babies, and feed them, and take care of them,” Mr. Raymond proceeded, “she might get a place as a nurse somewhere, you know. People do give money for that.”",dress baby feed take care proceed get place nurse know person give money 
23,"“Then I’ll ask mother,” said Diamond.",ask mother say 
24,"“But you’ll have to give her her food then; and your father, not being strong, has enough to do already without that.”",have give food father strong have enough do 
25,"“But here’s me,” said Diamond: “I help him out with it. When he’s tired of driving, up I get. It don’t make any difference to old Diamond. I don’t mean he likes me as well as my father--of course he can’t, you know--nobody could; but he does his duty all the same. It’s got to be done, you know, sir; and Diamond’s a good horse--isn’t he, sir?”",say help tired drive get make difference old mean like father course know do duty same get do know sir good horse sir 
26,“From your description I should say certainly; but I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance myself.”,description say have pleasure acquaintance 
27,"“Don’t you think he will go to heaven, sir?”",think go heaven sir 
28,"“That I don’t know anything about,” said Mr. Raymond. “I confess I should be glad to think so,” he added, smiling thoughtfully.",know say confess glad think add smile 
29,"“I’m sure he’ll get to the back of the north wind, anyhow,” said Diamond to himself; but he had learned to be very careful of saying such things aloud.",sure get back north wind say learn careful say such thing 
30,“Isn’t it rather too much for him to go in the cab all day and every day?” resumed Mr. Raymond.,much go cab day day resume 
31,"“So father says, when he feels his ribs of a morning. But then he says the old horse do eat well, and the moment he’s had his supper, down he goes, and never gets up till he’s called; and, for the legs of him, father says that makes no end of a differ. Some horses, sir! they won’t lie down all night long, but go to sleep on their four pins, like a haystack, father says. I think it’s very stupid of them, and so does old Diamond. But then I suppose they don’t know better, and so they can’t help it. We mustn’t be too hard upon them, father says.”",father say feel rib morning say old horse eat moment have supper go get call leg father say make end differ horse sir lie night go sleep pin haystack father say think stupid old suppose know good help hard father say 
32,"“Your father must be a good man, Diamond.” Diamond looked up in Mr. Raymond’s face, wondering what he could mean.",father good man look face wonder mean 
33,"“I said your father must be a good man, Diamond.”",say father good man 
34,"“Of course,” said Diamond. “How could he drive a cab if he wasn’t?”",course say drive cab 
35,"“There are some men who drive cabs who are not very good,” objected Mr. Raymond.",be man drive cab good object 
36,"Diamond remembered the drunken cabman, and saw that his friend was right.",remember drunken cabman see friend right 
37,"“Ah, but,” he returned, “he must be, you know, with such a horse as old Diamond.”",return know horse old 
38,"“That does make a difference,” said Mr. Raymond. “But it is quite enough that he is a good man without our trying to account for it. Now, if you like, I will give you a proof that I think him a good man. I am going away on the Continent for a while--for three months, I believe--and I am going to let my house to a gentleman who does not want the use of my brougham. My horse is nearly as old, I fancy, as your Diamond, but I don’t want to part with him, and I don’t want him to be idle; for nobody, as you say, ought to be idle; but neither do I want him to be worked very hard. Now, it has come into my head that perhaps your father would take charge of him, and work him under certain conditions.”",make difference say enough good man try account like give proof think good man go while month believe go let house gentleman want use brougham horse old fancy want part want idle say idle want work come head father take charge work certain condition 
39,"“My father will do what’s right,” said Diamond. “I’m sure of that.”",father do right say sure 
40,"“Well, so I think. Will you ask him when he comes home to call and have a little chat with me--to-day, some time?”",think ask come call have little chat day time 
41,"“He must have his dinner first,” said Diamond. “No, he’s got his dinner with him to-day. It must be after he’s had his tea.”",have dinner say get dinner day have tea 
42,"“Of course, of course. Any time will do. I shall be at home all day.”",course course time do home day 
43,"“Very well, sir. I will tell him. You may be sure he will come. My father thinks you a very kind gentleman, and I know he is right, for I know your very own self, sir.”",sir tell sure come father think kind gentleman know right know own self sir 
44,"Mr. Raymond smiled, and as they had now reached his door, they parted, and Diamond went home. As soon as his father entered the house, Diamond gave him Mr. Raymond’s message, and recounted the conversation that had preceded it. His father said little, but took thought-sauce to his bread and butter, and as soon as he had finished his meal, rose, saying:",smile reach door part go father enter house give message recount conversation precede father say little take thought sauce bread butter finish meal rise say 
45,"“I will go to your friend directly, Diamond. It would be a grand thing to get a little more money. We do want it.” Diamond accompanied his father to Mr. Raymond’s door, and there left him.",go friend grand thing get little more money want accompany father door leave 
46,"He was shown at once into Mr. Raymond’s study, where he gazed with some wonder at the multitude of books on the walls, and thought what a learned man Mr. Raymond must be.",show study gaze wonder multitude book wall think learn man 
47,"Presently Mr. Raymond entered, and after saying much the same about his old horse, made the following distinct proposal--one not over-advantageous to Diamond’s father, but for which he had reasons--namely, that Joseph should have the use of Mr. Raymond’s horse while he was away, on condition that he never worked him more than six hours a day, and fed him well, and that, besides, he should take Nanny home as soon as she was able to leave the hospital, and provide for her as one of his own children, neither better nor worse--so long, that is, as he had the horse.",enter say much same old horse make follow distinct proposal advantageous father have reason have use horse condition work more hour day feed take able leave hospital provide own child good bad have horse 
48,"Diamond’s father could not help thinking it a pretty close bargain. He should have both the girl and the horse to feed, and only six hours’ work out of the horse.",father help think close bargain have girl horse feed hour work horse 
49,"“It will save your own horse,” said Mr. Raymond.",save own horse say 
50,"“That is true,” answered Joseph; “but all I can get by my own horse is only enough to keep us, and if I save him and feed your horse and the girl--don’t you see, sir?”",true answer get own horse enough keep save feed horse girl see sir 
51,"“Well, you can go home and think about it, and let me know by the end of the week. I am in no hurry before then.”",go think let know end week hurry 
52,"So Joseph went home and recounted the proposal to his wife, adding that he did not think there was much advantage to be got out of it.",go recount proposal wife add think be much advantage get 
53,"“Not much that way, husband,” said Diamond’s mother; “but there would be an advantage, and what matter who gets it!”",much way husband say mother be advantage matter get 
54,"“I don’t see it,” answered her husband. “Mr. Raymond is a gentleman of property, and I don’t discover any much good in helping him to save a little more. He won’t easily get one to make such a bargain, and I don’t mean he shall get me. It would be a loss rather than a gain--I do think--at least if I took less work out of our own horse.”",see answer husband gentleman property discover good help save little more get make bargain mean get loss gain think least take less work own horse 
55,“One hour would make a difference to old Diamond. But that’s not the main point. You must think what an advantage it would be to the poor girl that hasn’t a home to go to!”,hour make difference old main point think advantage poor girl have home go 
56,"“She is one of Diamond’s friends,” thought his father.",friend think father 
57,"“I could be kind to her, you know,” the mother went on, “and teach her housework, and how to handle a baby; and, besides, she would help me, and I should be the stronger for it, and able to do an odd bit of charing now and then, when I got the chance.”",kind know mother go teach housework handle baby help strong able do odd bit charing get chance 
58,"“I won’t hear of that,” said her husband. “Have the girl by all means. I’m ashamed I did not think of both sides of the thing at once. I wonder if the horse is a great eater. To be sure, if I gave Diamond two hours’ additional rest, it would be all the better for the old bones of him, and there would be four hours extra out of the other horse. That would give Diamond something to do every day. He could drive old Diamond after dinner, and I could take the other horse out for six hours after tea, or in the morning, as I found best. It might pay for the keep of both of them,--that is, if I had good luck. I should like to oblige Mr. Raymond, though he be rather hard, for he has been very kind to our Diamond, wife. Hasn’t he now?”",hear say husband have girl means ashamed think side thing wonder horse great eater sure give hour additional rest good old bone be hour extra other horse give do day drive old dinner take other horse hour tea morning find good pay keep have good luck like oblige hard kind wife 
59,"“He has indeed, Joseph,” said his wife, and there the conversation ended.",say wife conversation end 
60,"Diamond’s father went the very next day to Mr. Raymond, and accepted his proposal; so that the week after having got another stall in the same stable, he had two horses instead of one. Oddly enough, the name of the new horse was Ruby, for he was a very red chestnut. Diamond’s name came from a white lozenge on his forehead. Young Diamond said they were rich now, with such a big diamond and such a big ruby.",father go very next day accept proposal week get stall same stable have horse name new horse red chestnut name come white lozenge forehead young say rich big diamond big ruby
