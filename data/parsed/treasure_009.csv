2,"THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain.",lay way go figurehead stern many other ship cable grate keel swing last get meet salute step mate brown old sailor earring ear squint squire thick friendly observe thing same captain

22,"""I don't, sir. I believe he's a good seaman, but he's too free with the crew to be a good officer. A mate should keep himself to himself--shouldn't drink with the men before the mast!""",sir believe good seaman free crew good officer mate keep drink man mast

They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward.

36,"""It doesn't much matter who it was,"" replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island.",matter reply doctor see captain pay much regard protestation sure loose talker case believe right tell situation island

39,"""Sir,"" said Captain Smollett, ""with no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her.

49,"The new arrangement was quite to my liking. The whole schooner had been overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. It had been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house. Very low it was still, of course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement. Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the benefit of his opinion.",new arrangement like whole schooner overhaul berth make astern after part main hold set cabin join galley forecastle sparr passage port side mean captain doctor squire occupy berth get captain sleep deck companion enlarge side call round house low course be room swing hammock mate seem pleased arrangement doubtful crew guess hear have long benefit opinion

62,The Voyage,
63,"ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns.",night great bustle get thing stow place boatful squire friend come wish good voyage safe return have night have work dog tired little dawn boatswain sound pipe crew begin man capstan bar weary leave deck new interesting brief command shrill note whistle man bustle place glimmer ship lantern

70,"And at the third ""Ho!"" drove the bars before them with a will.",third drive bar will 
71,"Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure.",exciting moment carry old second seem hear voice captain pipe chorus anchor short hang drip bow sail begin draw land shipping flit side lie snatch hour slumber begin voyage 
72,"I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known.",go relate voyage detail prosperous ship prove good ship crew capable seamen captain understand business come length thing happen require know 
73,"Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably.",first turn bad captain fear have command man person do pleased mean bad day sea begin appear deck hazy eye red cheek stutter tongue other mark drunkenness time time order disgrace fall cut lay day little bunk side companion day sober attend work least 
74,"In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That was the ship's mystery. Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water.",meantime make get drink ship mystery watch pleased do solve ask face laugh drunk sober deny taste water 
75,"He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.",useless officer bad influence man plain rate kill surprise sorry dark night head sea disappear see more 
76,"""Overboard!"" said the captain. ""Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.""",overboard say captain gentleman save trouble put iron 
77,"But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.",mate necessary course advance man boatswain likeliest man keep old title serve way mate follow sea knowledge make useful take watch easy weather coxswain careful wily old experienced seaman trust pinch 
78,"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him.",great confidant long mention name lead speak ship cook man call 
79,"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced.",aboard ship carry crutch lanyard neck have hand free possible see wedge foot crutch bulkhead proppe yield movement ship get cooking safe strange see heavy weather cross deck have line rig help wide space long earring call hand place use crutch trail lanyard man walk man sail express pity see reduce 
80,"""He's no common man, Barbecue,"" said the coxswain to me. ""He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.""",common man say coxswain have good schooling young day speak book minded brave lion see grapple knock head unarmed 
81,"All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner.",crew respect obey have way talk do particular service kind glad see galley keep clean new pin dish hang burnish parrot cage corner 
82,"""Come away, Hawkins,"" he would say; ""come and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?""",come say come have yarn welcome son sit hear news call parrot famous buccaneer predict success v'yage cap

84,"""Now, that bird,"" he would say, ""is, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins! She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. But you smelt powder--didn't you, cap'n?""",bird say year old live see more wickedness devil sail great pirate fishing wreck plate ship learn piece little wonder boarding viceroy look think babby smell powder cap

86,"""Ah, she's a handsome craft, she is,"" the cook would say, and give her sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. ""There,"" John would add, ""you can't touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. Here's this poor old innocent bird o' mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that. She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before chaplain."" And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men.",handsome craft cook say give sugar pocket bird peck bar swear pass belief wickedness add touch pitch muck lad poor old innocent bird o' swear blue fire wise lay swear same manner speak chaplain touch forelock solemn way have make think good man 
87,"In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another. The squire made no bones about the matter; he despised the captain. The captain, on his part, never spoke but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to her. ""She'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,"" he would add, ""all I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise.""",meantime squire distant term squire make bone matter despise captain captain part speak speak sharp short dry word waste own drive corner seem wrong crew brisk want see behave ship take downright fancy lie point wind man have right expect own married wife sir add say like cruise

89,"""A trifle more of that man,"" he would say, ""and I shall explode.""",trifle more man say explode 
90,"We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea. Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man's birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy.",have heavy weather prove quality man board seem content hard please belief be ship company spoiled put sea double grog go least excuse be duff odd day instance squire hear man birthday barrel apple stand broach waist help have fancy

92,"But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery.",good come apple barrel hear have note warning perish hand treachery 
93,This was how it came about.,come 
94,"We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island. We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure.",run trade get wind island allow plain run bright lookout day night last day outward voyage large computation time night late noon morrow sight head have steady breeze abeam quiet sea roll dip bowsprit whiff spray draw bravest spirit end first part adventure 
95,"Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship.",sundown work way berth occur like apple run deck watch look island man helm watch luff sail whistle only sound except swish sea bow side ship 
96,"In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak. It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone.",get bodily apple barrel find be scarce apple leave sit dark sound water rock movement ship fall asleep point do heavy man sit clash barrel shake learn shoulder about jump man begin speak voice hear word show world lay tremble listen extreme fear curiosity word understand life honest man depend
