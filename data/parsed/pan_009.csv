1,CHAPTER 9. THE NEVER BIRD,bird 
2,"The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.",last sound hear alone mermaid retire bedchamber sea hear door shut door coral cave live ring tiny bell open close nice house mainland hear bell 
3,"Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.",water rise nibble foot pass time make final gulp watch only thing lagoon think piece float paper part kite wonder take drift 
4,"Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.",notice odd thing lagoon definite purpose fight tide win win sympathetic weak side help clap gallant piece paper 
5,"It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.",piece paper never bird make desperate effort reach nest work wing way learn nest fall water able extent guide strange craft time recognise exhausted come save give nest be egg wonder bird nice torment suppose rest melt have first tooth 
6,"She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.",call come call do course understand other language fanciful story person talk bird wish moment pretend story say reply bird truth good want tell happen understand other forget manners 
7,"“I--want--you--to--get--into--the--nest,” the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, “and--then--you--can--drift--ashore, but--I--am--too--tired--to--bring--it--any--nearer--so--you--must--try to--swim--to--it.”",want get nest bird call speak possible drift try swim

19,"Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.",bird determined save last mighty effort propel nest rock fly desert egg make meaning clear 
20,"Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.",last understand clutch nest wave thanks bird flutter receive thanks hang sky watch get nest see do egg 
21,"There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.",be large white egg lift reflect bird cover face wing see last help peep feather 
22,"I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.",forget tell be stave rock drive buccaneer mark site bury treasure child discover glitter hoard mischievous mood use fling shower moidore diamond pearl piece gull pounce food fly rage scurvy trick play stave hang hat deep tarpaulin watertight broad brim put egg hat set lagoon float 
23,"The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.",bird see scream admiration crow agreement get nest rear stave mast hang shirt sail same moment bird flutter hat sit egg drift direction borne cheer 
24,"Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship, actually the Never Bird’s nest in this particular case in point] in a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing.",course land beach barque small ship bird nest particular case point place bird find hat great success abandon nest drift go piece come shore lagoon many bitter feeling watch bird sit hat see worth mention bird build shape nest broad brim youngster take airing 
25,"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",great rejoicing reach home ground carry kite boy have adventure tell big adventure several hour late bed inflate do various dodgy thing get stay such demand bandage glory have safe sound scandalise lateness hour cry bed bed voice have obey next day tender give bandage one play bed time limp carry arm sling
