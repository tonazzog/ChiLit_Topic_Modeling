2," It was only to Oswald that Edward made known what had occurred; he knew that he was to be trusted. The next day, Edward resumed his forester's dress, while another one was preparing for him, and went over to the cottage, where, with the consent of the intendant, he proposed remaining for a few days. Of course, Edward had not failed to acquaint the intendant with his proposed plans relative to Chaloner and Grenville, and received his consent; at the same time advising that they should gain the other side of the Channel as soon as they possibly could. Edward found them all very anxious for his arrival. Humphrey and Pablo had been to the cottage, which they had found undisturbed since the capture of the robbers, and made every thing ready for the reception of the two Cavaliers, as, on their first journey, they took with them a cart-load of what they knew would be necessary. Chaloner and Grenville appeared to be quite at home already, and not very willing to shift their quarters. They, of course, still retained their troopers' clothes, as they had no other to wear until they could be procured from Lymington; but, as we have before mentioned, they were in no want of money. They had been amusing the girls and Humphrey with a description of what had occurred during the campaign, and Edward found that he had but little to tell them, as Chaloner had commenced his narrative with an account of his first meeting with Edward when he had been attacked by the highwaymen. As soon as he could get away, Edward went out with Humphrey to have some conversation with him.",know occur know trust next day resume forester dress one prepare go cottage consent intendant propose remain few day course fail acquaint intendant propose plan relative receive consent same time advise gain other side find anxious arrival cottage find undisturbed capture robber make thing ready reception first journey take cart load know necessary appear home willing shift quarter course retain trooper clothes have other wear procure mention want money amusing girl description occur campaign find have little tell commence narrative account first meeting attack highwaymen get go have conversation

4,"""I have no such tales of stirring interest to narrate as Chaloner has been doing as your deputy, Edward,"" replied Humphrey.

8,"""I rather think that I have found that I was born for it,"" replied Humphrey, ""although, I must confess, that since you have quitted us, I have not felt so contented here as I did before.

9,"""Perhaps so, Humphrey,"" replied Edward; ""and yet do you know, that, although I so ardently wished to mix with the world, and to follow the wars, I am any thing but satisfied with what I have seen of it; and so far from feeling any inclination to return to it, I rather feel more inclined to remain here, and remain in quiet and in peace. I have been disappointed, that is the truth. There is a great difference between the world such as we fancy it when we are pining for it, and the world when we actually are placed within the vortex, and perceive the secret springs of men's actions. I have gained a lesson, but not a satisfactory one, Humphrey; it may be told in a very few words. It is a most deceitful and hollow world! and that is all said in a few words.""",reply know wish mix world follow war thing satisfied see feel inclination return feel inclined remain remain quiet peace disappoint truth be great difference world such fancy pine world place vortex perceive secret spring man action gain lesson satisfactory one tell few word deceitful hollow world say few word

11,"""Chaloner I know well,"" replied Edward; ""he is to be trusted, and he is the only one in whom I have been able to place confidence, and therefore I was most fortunate in falling in with him as I did on my first starting. Grenville, I know little about; we met often, it is true, but it was in the presence of the king, being both of us on his staff; at the same time, I must acknowledge that I know nothing against him; and this I do know, which is, that he is brave.""",know reply trust only one able place confidence fortunate fall do first starting know little meet true presence king staff same time acknowledge know know brave

The intendant was talking with me on the subject last night, and here is an appointment for you as verderer, signed by him, which you are to use as you may find necessary; and here is another missive, ordering you to receive into your house two of the troopers who may be sent down here, and find them quarters and victuals, but not to be compelled to receive more. Until the search is over, Chaloner and Grenville must retain their accouterments and remain with us. And, Humphrey, if you have not made any use of the clothes which I left here--I mean the first dress I had made when I was appointed secretary, and which I thought rather too faded to wear any longer--I will put it on now, as should any military come here as scouters to the intendant, I shall have some authority over them.""",prepare reply mention forget intendant talk subject last night appointment verderer sign use find necessary missive order receive house trooper send find quarter victual compel receive more search retain accouterment remain make use clothes leave mean first dress make appoint secretary think fade wear put military come scouter intendant have authority

21,"""And are we ever to return?""",return 
22,"""I don't know. I thought little of it before I went away and mixed in society; but since I have been in the world, I have been compelled to feel that my dear sisters are not in their sphere, and I have resolved upon trying if I can not find a more suitable position for them. Had we been successful I should have had no difficulty, but now I hardly know what to do.""",know think little go mix society world compel feel dear sister sphere resolve try find suitable position successful have difficulty know do

28,"""Not Beverley, I pray you; that name is to be forgotten; it was only revived for the occasion.""",pray name forget revive occasion 
29,"""Very true; then, Master Secretary Armitage, I think the arrangement excellent: the only point will be to find out what troops are sent down in this direction, as we must of course belong to some other regiment, and have been pursued from the field of battle. I should think that Lambert's squadrons will not be this way.""",true think arrangement excellent only point find troops send direction course belong other regiment pursue field battle think squadron way

32,"""I have reflected upon it,"" replied Edward, ""and I think it was perhaps prudent: some were to be trusted and some not; it was impossible to know who were and who were not--he therefore trusted nobody. Besides, his chance of escape, if quite alone, is greater than if in company.""",reflect reply think prudent trust impossible know trust chance escape alone great company

34,"""He could no more read your heart, than he could mine or others,"" observed Chaloner; ""and any selection would have been invidious: on the whole, I think he acted wisely, and I trust that it will prove so. One thing is certain, which is, that all is over now, and that for a long while we may let our swords rest in their scabbards. Indeed, I am sickened with it, after what I have seen, and would gladly live here with you, and help to till the land, away from the world and all its vexations.

But still it is selfish for me to talk in this way; indeed, my feelings are contrary to my words.""",think such amiable pretty mistress stay content selfish talk way feeling contrary word 
37,"""How do you mean, Chaloner?""",mean 
38,"""To be candid with you, Edward, I was thinking what a pity it is that two such sweet girls as your sisters should be employed here in domestic drudgery, and remain in such an uncultivated state--if I may be pardoned for speaking so freely--but I do so because I am convinced that, if in proper hands, they would grace a court; and you must feel that I am right.""",candid think pity such sweet girl sister employ domestic drudgery remain uncultivated state pardon speak convinced proper hand grace court feel right 
39,"""Do you not think that the same feelings have passed in my mind, Chaloner? Indeed, Humphrey will tell you that we were speaking on the same subject but an hour ago. You must, however, be aware of the difficulty I am in: were I in possession of Arnwood and its domain, then indeed--but that is all over now, and I presume I shall shortly see my own property, whose woods are now in sight of me, made over to some Roundhead, for good services against the Cavaliers at Worcester.""",think same feeling pass mind tell speak same subject hour aware difficulty possession domain presume see own property wood sight make good service 
40,"""Edward,"" replied Chaloner, ""I have this to say to you, and I can say it because you know that I am indebted to you for my life, and that is a debt that nothing can cancel: if at any time you determine upon removing your sisters from this, recollect my maiden aunts at Portlake. They can not be in better hands, and they can not be in the hands of any person who will more religiously do their duty toward them, and be pleased with the trust confided to them. They are rich, in spite of exactions; but in these times, women are not fined and plundered as men are; and they have been well able to afford all that has been taken from them, and all that they have voluntarily given to the assistance of our party. They are alone, and I really believe that nothing would make them more happy than to have the care of the two sisters of Edward Beverley--be sure of that. But I will be more sure of it if you will find means of sending to them a letter which I shall write to them. I tell you that you will do them a favor, and that if you do not accept the offer, you will sacrifice your sisters' welfare to your own pride--which I do not think you would do.""",reply have say say know indebted life debt cancel time determine remove sister recollect maiden aunt good hand hand person do duty pleased trust confide rich spite exaction time woman fine plunder man able afford take give assistance party alone believe make happy have care sister sure sure find means send letter write tell do favor accept offer sacrifice sister welfare own pride think do 
41,"""Most certainly I will not do that,"" replied Edward; ""and I am fully sensible of your kind offer; but I can say no more until I hear what your good aunts may reply to your letter. You mistake me much, Chaloner, if you think that any sense of obligation would prevent me from seeing my sisters removed from a position so unworthy of them, but which circumstances have driven them to. That we are paupers, is undeniable, but I never shall forgot that my sisters are the daughters of Colonel Beverley.""",do reply sensible kind offer say more hear good aunt reply letter mistake much think sense obligation prevent see sister remove position unworthy circumstance drive pauper undeniable forget sister daughter

45,"""Now, Chaloner, we must get ourselves out of this scrape, and I trust that afterward all be well,"" said Edward. ""Bring the horses out to the door; and, Chaloner, you and Grenville must wait within; bring my horse out also, as it will appear as if I had just ridden over. I must in to change my dress.

46,"Chaloner and Edward went in, and Edward put on his dress of secretary. Shortly afterward, a party of Roundhead cavalry were seen galloping toward the cottage.

66,"""That's very true, and shows your penetration. I must acknowledge that, with troopers, there would have been more difficulty; but still, among so many thousands, there must be many varieties, and it would be an awkward thing for an officer of one troop to arrest upon suspicion the men belonging to another.

68,"For three or four days the Parliamentary forces continued to scour the forest, and another visit or two was paid to the cottage, but without suspicion being created, in consequence of the presence of Edward and his explanations. The parties were invariably sent in another direction. Edward wrote to the intendant, informing him what had occurred, and requesting permission to remain a few days longer at the cottage; and Pablo, who took the letter, returned with one from the intendant, acquainting him that the king had not yet been taken; and requesting the utmost vigilance on his part to insure his capture, with directions to search various places, in company with the troopers who had been stationed at the cottage; or, if he did not like to leave the cottage, to shew the letter to any officer commanding parties in search, that they might act upon the suggestions contained in it.

As soon as Humphrey had obtained what was requisite, Chaloner and Grenville were conducted to Clara's cottage, and took possession, of course never showing themselves outside the wood which surrounded it. Humphrey lent them Holdfast as a watch, and they took leave of Alice and Edith with much regret. Humphrey and Edward accompanied them to their new abode.

It appears that the officers you fell in with have written up to state what admirable dispositions we had made. It is a pity, is it not, Edward, that we are compelled to be thus deceitful in this world? Nothing but the times, and the wish to do good, could warrant it.
