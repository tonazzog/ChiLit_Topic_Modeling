10,"One night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed.

11,"“Shall I love you?” said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow.

Then, when the autumn came they all flew away.",ridiculous attachment twitter other swallow have money many relation river full autumn come fly 
13,"After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. “She has no conversation,” he said, “and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind.”  And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtseys.  “I admit that she is domestic,” he continued, “but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also.”",go feel lonely begin tire lady love have conversation say afraid coquette flirt wind wind blow make graceful curtsey admit domestic continue love travel wife love travel

19,"“I have a golden bedroom,” he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing a large drop of water fell on him.  “What a curious thing!” he cried; “there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining.  The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful.  The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness.”",have golden bedroom say look prepare go sleep put head wing large drop water fall curious thing cry be single cloud sky star clear bright rain climate north dreadful use like rain selfishness

27,"“When I was alive and had a human heart,” answered the statue, “I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci, where sorrow is not allowed to enter.  In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall.  Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful.  My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness.  So I lived, and so I died.  And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot chose but weep.”",alive have human heart answer statue know tear live sorrow allow enter daytime play companion garden evening lead dance great garden run lofty wall care ask lay beautiful courtier call happy happy pleasure happiness live die dead set high see ugliness misery city heart make lead choose weep

29,"“Far away,” continued the statue in a low musical voice, “far away in a little street there is a poor house.  One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table.  Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress.  She is embroidering passion-flowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen’s maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball.  In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill.  He has a fever, and is asking for oranges.  His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying.

30,"“I am waited for in Egypt,” said the Swallow.  “My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus-flowers.  Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King.

32,"“I don’t think I like boys,” answered the Swallow.  “Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller’s sons, who were always throwing stones at me.

38,"He passed over the river, and saw the lanterns hanging to the masts of the ships.  He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales.  At last he came to the poor house and looked in.  The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired.  In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman’s thimble. Then he flew gently round the bed, fanning the boy’s forehead with his wings.  “How cool I feel,” said the boy, “I must be getting better”; and he sank into a delicious slumber.",pass river see lantern hang mast ship pass see old bargain other weigh money copper scale last come poor house look boy toss bed mother fall asleep tired hopp lay great ruby table woman thimble fly bed fann boy forehead wing cool feel say boy get good sink delicious slumber

41,"When day broke he flew down to the river and had a bath.  “What a remarkable phenomenon,” said the Professor of Ornithology as he was passing over the bridge.  “A swallow in winter!”  And he wrote a long letter about it to the local newspaper.  Every one quoted it, it was full of so many words that they could not understand.",day break fly river have bath remarkable phenomenon say pass bridge swallow winter write long letter local newspaper one quote full many word understand 
42,"“To-night I go to Egypt,” said the Swallow, and he was in high spirits at the prospect.  He visited all the public monuments, and sat a long time on top of the church steeple.  Wherever he went the Sparrows chirruped, and said to each other, “What a distinguished stranger!” so he enjoyed himself very much.",night go say high spirit prospect visit public monument sit long time top church steeple go chirrupe say other distinguished stranger enjoy

45,"“I am waited for in Egypt,” answered the Swallow.  “To-morrow my friends will fly up to the Second Cataract.  The river-horse couches there among the bulrushes, and on a great granite throne sits the God Memnon.  All night long he watches the stars, and when the morning star shines he utters one cry of joy, and then he is silent.  At noon the yellow lions come down to the water’s edge to drink.  They have eyes like green beryls, and their roar is louder than the roar of the cataract.”",wait answer swallow friend fly second river horse couch bulrushe great granite throne sit night watch star morning star shine utter cry joy silent noon yellow lion come water edge drink have eye green beryl roar louder roar cataract 
46,"“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “far away across the city I see a young man in a garret.  He is leaning over a desk covered with papers, and in a tumbler by his side there is a bunch of withered violets.  His hair is brown and crisp, and his lips are red as a pomegranate, and he has large and dreamy eyes.  He is trying to finish a play for the Director of the Theatre, but he is too cold to write any more.  There is no fire in the grate, and hunger has made him faint.”",swallow little say city see young man garret lean desk cover paper tumbler side be bunch wither violet hair brown crisp lip red pomegranate have large dreamy eye try finish play cold write more be fire grate hunger make faint

48,"“Alas!  I have no ruby now,” said the Prince; “my eyes are all that I have left.  They are made of rare sapphires, which were brought out of India a thousand years ago.

He will sell it to the jeweller, and buy food and firewood, and finish his play.”",have ruby say eye leave make rare sapphire bring year pluck take sell jeweller buy food firewood finish play

50,"“Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow,” said the Prince, “do as I command you.”",swallow swallow little swallow say do command 
51,"So the Swallow plucked out the Prince’s eye, and flew away to the student’s garret.  It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof.  Through this he darted, and came into the room.  The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird’s wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.",pluck eye fly student garret easy get be hole roof dart come room young man have head bury hand hear flutter bird wing look find beautiful sapphire lie wither violet

53,"The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour.  He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes.  “Heave a-hoy!” they shouted as each chest came up.  “I am going to Egypt”! cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.",next day fly harbour sit mast large vessel watch sailor haul big chest hold rope heave shout chest come go cry minded moon rise fly happy

56,"“It is winter,” answered the Swallow, “and the chill snow will soon be here.  In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them.  My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other.  Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away.  The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.”",winter answer swallow chill snow sun warm green palm tree crocodile lie mud look companion build nest pink white dove watch cooe other dear leave forget next spring bring beautiful jewel place give ruby redder red rose sapphire blue great sea 
57,"“In the square below,” said the Happy Prince, “there stands a little match-girl.  She has let her matches fall in the gutter, and they are all spoiled.

63,"“I will stay with you always,” said the Swallow, and he slept at the Prince’s feet.",stay say sleep foot 
64,"All the next day he sat on the Prince’s shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands.  He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold-fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.",next day sit shoulder tell story see strange land tell red ibise stand long row bank catch gold fish beak old world live desert know merchant walk side camel carry amber bead hand black worship large crystal great green snake sleep palm tree have priest feed honey cake pygmie sail big lake large flat leave war butterfly 
65,"“Dear little Swallow,” said the Prince, “you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women.  There is no Mystery so great as Misery.  Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there.”",dear little say tell marvellous thing marvellous suffering man woman be mystery great misery fly city little swallow tell see 
66,"So the Swallow flew over the great city, and saw the rich making merry in their beautiful houses, while the beggars were sitting at the gates.  He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets.  Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another’s arms to try and keep themselves warm.  “How hungry we are!” they said.  “You must not lie here,” shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.",fly great city see rich make merry beautiful house beggar sit gate fly dark lane see white face starve child look black street archway bridge little boy lie arm try keep warm hungry say lie shout wander rain

70,"Then the snow came, and after the snow came the frost.
