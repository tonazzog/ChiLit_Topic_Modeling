1,CHAPTER XII. BACK TO THE DOVECOTE,
2," FOR the first time in her residence at Adlerstein, now full half her life, the Freiherrinn Christina ventured to send a messenger to Ulm, namely, a lay brother of the convent of St. Ruprecht, who undertook to convey to Master Gottfried Sorel her letter, informing him of the death of her mother-in-law, and requesting him to send the same tidings to the Freiherr von Adlerstein Wildschloss, the kinsman and godfather of her sons.",first time residence full life venture send messenger lay brother convent undertake convey letter inform death mother law request send same tiding kinsman godfather son 
3,"She was used to wait fifty-two weeks for answers to her letters, and was amazed when, at the end of three, two stout serving-men were guided by Jobst up the pass; but her heart warmed to their flat caps and round jerkins, they looked so like home.  They bore a letter of invitation to her and her sons to come at once to her uncle’s house.  The King of the Romans, and perhaps the Emperor, were to come to the city early in the summer, and there could be no better opportunity of presenting the young Barons to their sovereign.  Sir Kasimir of Adlerstein Wildschloss would meet them there for the purpose, and would obtain their admission to the League, in which all Swabian nobles had bound themselves to put down robbery and oppression, and outside which there was nothing but outlawry and danger.",use wait week answer letter amaze end stout serving man guide pass heart warm flat cap round jerkin look home bear letter invitation son come uncle house emperor come city summer be good opportunity present young sovereign meet purpose obtain admission swabian noble bind put robbery oppression be outlawry danger 
4,"“So must it be?” said Ebbo, between his teeth, as he leant moodily against the wall, while his mother was gone to attend to the fare to be set before the messengers.",say tooth lean wall mother gone attend fare set messenger 
5,"“What! art not glad to take wing at last?” exclaimed Friedel, cut short in an exclamation of delight.",art glad take wing last exclaim cut short exclamation delight 
6,"“Take wing, forsooth!  To be guest of a greasy burgher, and call cousin with him!  Fear not, Friedel; I’ll not vex the motherling.  Heaven knows she has had pain, grief, and subjection enough in her lifetime, and I would not hinder her visit to her home; but I would she could go alone, nor make us show our poverty to the swollen city folk, and listen to their endearments.  I charge thee, Friedel, do as I do; be not too familiar with them.  Could we but sprain an ankle over the crag—”",take wing forsooth guest greasy burgher call cousin fear vex motherling heaven know have pain grief subjection lifetime hinder visit home go make show poverty swollen city folk listen endearment charge do do familiar sprain ankle crag 
7,"“Nay, she would stay to nurse us,” said Friedel, laughing; “besides, thou art needed for the matter of homage.”",stay nurse say laugh art need matter homage 
8,"“Look, Friedel,” said Ebbo, sinking his voice, “I shall not lightly yield my freedom to king or Kaiser.  Maybe, there is no help for it; but it irks me to think that I should be the last Lord of Adlerstein to whom the title of Freiherr is not a mockery.  Why dost bend thy brow, brother? What art thinking of?”",look say sink voice yield freedom king be help irk think last title mockery bend brow brother art think 
9,"“Only a saying in my mother’s book, that well-ordered service is true freedom,” said Friedel.  “And methinks there will be freedom in rushing at last into the great far-off!”—the boy’s eye expanded and glistened with eagerness.  “Here are we prisoners—to ourselves, if you like—but prisoners still, pent up in the rocks, seeing no one, hearing scarce an echo from the knightly or the poet world, nor from all the wonders that pass.  And the world has a history going on still, like the _Chronicle_. Oh, Ebbo, think of being in the midst of life, with lance and sword, and seeing the Kaiser—the Kaiser of the holy Roman Empire!”",saying mother book order service true freedom say methink be freedom rush last great boy eye expand glisten eagerness prisoner like prisoner pend rock see hear scarce echo knightly poet world wonder pass world have history go think midst life lance sword see holy roman 
10,"“With lance and sword, well and good; but would it were not at the cost of liberty!”",lance sword good cost liberty 
11,"However Ebbo forbore to damp his mother’s joy, save by the one warning—“Understand, mother, that I will not be pledged to anything.  I will not bend to the yoke ere I have seen and judged for myself.”",forbore damp mother joy save warning understand mother pledge bend yoke see judge 
12,"The manly sound of the words gave a sweet sense of exultation to the mother, even while she dreaded the proud spirit, and whispered, “God direct thee, my son.”",manly sound word give sweet sense exultation mother dread proud spirit whisper direct son 
13,"Certainly Ebbo, hitherto the most impetuous and least thoughtful of the two lads, had a gravity and seriousness about him, that, but for his naturally sweet temper, would have seemed sullen.  His aspirations for adventure had hitherto been more vehement than Friedel’s; but, when the time seemed at hand, his regrets at what he might have to yield overpowered his hopes of the future.  The fierce haughtiness of the old Adlersteins could not brook the descent from the crag, even while the keen, clear burgher wit that Ebbo inherited from the other side of the house taught him that the position was untenable, and that his isolated glory was but a poor mean thing after all.  And the struggle made him sad and moody.",impetuous thoughtful lad have gravity seriousness sweet temper seem sullen aspiration adventure vehement time seem hand regret have yield overpower hope future fierce haughtiness old briok descent crag keen clear burgher wit inherit other side house teach position untenable isolated glory poor mean thing struggle make sad moody 
14,"Friedel, less proud, and with nothing to yield, was open to blithe anticipations of what his fancy pictured as the home of all the beauty, sacred or romantic, that he had glimpsed at through his mother. Religion, poetry, learning, art, refinement, had all come to him through her; and though he had a soul that dreamt and soared in the lonely grandeur of the mountain heights, it craved further aliment for its yearnings for completeness and perfection.  Long ago had Friedel come to the verge of such attainments as he could work out of his present materials, and keen had been his ardour for the means of progress, though only the mountain tarn had ever been witness to the full outpouring of the longings with which he gazed upon the dim, distant city like a land of enchantment.",proud yield open blithe anticipation fancy picture home beauty sacred romantic glimpse mother religion poetry learning art refinement come have soul dreamt soar lonely grandeur mountain height crave further aliment yearning completeness perfection come verge such attainment work present material keen ardour means progress mountain tarn witness full outpouring longing gaze dim distant city land enchantment 
15,"The journey was to be at once, so as to profit by the escort of Master Sorel’s men.  Means of transport were scanty, but Ebbo did not choose that the messengers should report the need, and bring back a bevy of animals at the burgher’s expense; so the mother was mounted on the old white mare, and her sons and Heinz trusted to their feet.  By setting out early on a May morning, the journey could be performed ere night, and the twilight would find them in the domains of the free city, where their small numbers would be of no importance.  As to their appearance, the mother wore a black woollen gown and mantle, and a black silk hood tied under her chin, and sitting loosely round the stiff frame of her white cap—a nun-like garb, save for the soft brown hair, parted over her brow, and more visible than she sometimes thought correct, but her sons would not let her wear it out of sight.",journey profit escort man means transport scanty choose messenger report need bring bevy animal burgher expense mother mount old white mare son trust foot set morning journey perform night twilight find domain free city small number importance appearance mother wear black woollen gown mantle black silk hood tie chin sit stiff frame white cap nun garb save soft brown hair part brow visible think correct son let wear sight 
16,"The brothers had piece by piece surveyed the solitary suit of armour remaining in the castle; but, though it might serve for defence, it could not be made fit for display, and they must needs be contented with blue cloth, spun, woven, dyed, fashioned, and sewn at home, chiefly by their mother, and by her embroidered on the breast with the white eagle of Adlerstein.  Short blue cloaks and caps of the same, with an eagle plume in each, and leggings neatly fashioned of deerskin, completed their equipments.  Ebbo wore his father’s sword, Friedel had merely a dagger and crossbow.  There was not a gold chain, not a brooch, not an approach to an ornament among the three, except the medal that had always distinguished Ebbo, and the coral rosary at Christina’s girdle.  Her own trinkets had gone in masses for the souls of her father and husband; and though a few costly jewels had been found in Frau Kunigunde’s hoards, the mode of their acquisition was so doubtful, that it had seemed fittest to bestow them in alms and masses for the good of her soul.",brother have piece piece survey solitary suit armour remain castle serve defence make fit display need content blue cloth spun wove dyed fashioned sew home mother embroider breast white eagle short blue cloak cap same eagle plume legging fashioned deerskin complete equipment wear father sword have dagger crossbow be gold chain brooch approach ornament medal distinguish coral rosary girdle own trinket go mass soul father husband few costly jewel find hoard mode acquisition doubtful seem fittest bestow alm mass good soul 
17,"“What ornament, what glory could any one desire better than two such sons?” thought Christina, as for the first time for eighteen years she crossed the wild ravine where her father had led her, a trembling little captive, longing for wings like a dove’s to flutter home again.  Who would then have predicted that she should descend after so long and weary a time, and with a gallant boy on either side of her, eager to aid her every step, and reassure her at each giddy pass, all joy and hope before her and them?  Yet she was not without some dread and misgiving, as she watched her elder son, always attentive to her, but unwontedly silent, with a stern gravity on his young brow, a proud sadness on his lip.  And when he had come to the Debateable Ford, and was about to pass the boundaries of his own lands, he turned and gazed back on the castle and mountain with a silent but passionate ardour, as though he felt himself doing them a wrong by perilling their independence.",ornament glory one desire good such son think first time year cross wild ravine father lead tremble little captive long wing dove flutter predict descend long weary time gallant boy side eager aid step reassure giddy pass joy hope dread misgiving watch elder son attentive silent stern gravity young brow proud sadness lip come debateable about pass boundary own land turn gaze castle mountain silent passionate ardour feel do wrong perill independence 
18,"The sun had lately set, and the moon was silvering the Danube, when the travellers came full in view of the imperial free city, girt in with mighty walls and towers—the vine-clad hill dominated by its crowning church; the irregular outlines of the unfinished spire of the cathedral traced in mysterious dark lacework against the pearly sky; the lofty steeple-like gate-tower majestically guarding the bridge.  Christina clasped her hands in thankfulness, as at the familiar face of a friend; Friedel glowed like a minstrel introduced to his fair dame, long wooed at a distance; Ebbo could not but exclaim, “Yea, truly, a great city is a solemn and a glorious sight!”",sun set moon silver traveller come full view imperial free city girt mighty wall tower vine clad hill dominate crown church irregular outline unfinished spire cathedral trace mysterious dark lacework pearly sky lofty steeple like gate tower guard bridge clasp hand thankfulness familiar face friend glow minstrel introduce fair dame wooe distance exclaim great city solemn glorious sight 
19,"The gates were closed, and the serving-men had to parley at the barbican ere the heavy door was opened to admit the party to the bridge, between deep battlemented stone walls, with here and there loopholes, showing the shimmering of the river beneath.  The slow, tired tread of the old mare sounded hollow; the river rushed below with the full swell of evening loudness; a deep-toned convent-bell tolled gravely through the stillness, while, between its reverberations, clear, distinct notes of joyous music were borne on the summer wind, and a nightingale sung in one of the gardens that bordered the banks.",gate close serving man have parley heavy door open admit party bridge deep battlement stone wall loophole show shimmering river slow tired tread old mare sound hollow river rush full swell evening loudness deep tone convent bell toll stillness reverberation clear distinct note joyous music borne summer wind nightingale sung garden border bank 
20,"“Mother, it is all that I dreamt!” breathlessly murmured Friedel, as they halted under the dark arch of the great gateway tower.",mother dreamt murmure halt dark arch great gateway tower 
21,"Not however in Friedel’s dreams had been the hearty voice that proceeded from the lighted guard-room in the thickness of the gateway. “Freiherrinn von Adlerstein!  Is it she?  Then must I greet my old playmate!”  And the captain of the watch appeared among upraised lanterns and torches that showed a broad, smooth, plump face beneath a plain steel helmet.",dream hearty voice proceed light guard room thickness gateway greet old playmate captain watch appear upraise lantern torche show broad smooth plump face plain steel helmet 
22,"“Welcome, gracious lady, welcome to your old city.  What! do you not remember Lippus Grundt, your poor Valentine?”",gracious lady old city remember poor 
23,"“Master Philip Grundt!” exclaimed Christina, amazed at the breadth of visage and person; “and how fares it with my good Regina?”",master exclaim amaze breadth visage person fare good 
24,"“Excellent well, good lady.  She manages her trade and house as well as the good man Bartoläus Fleischer himself.  Blithe will she be to show you her goodly ten, as I shall my eight,” he continued, walking by her side; “and Barbara—you remember Barbara Schmidt, lady—”",excellent good lady manage trade house good man show goodly continue walk side remember lady 
25,“My dear Barbara?—That do I indeed!  Is she your wife?”,dear wife 
26,"“Ay, truly, lady,” he answered, in an odd sort of apologetic tone; “you see, you returned not, and the housefathers, they would have it so—and Barbara is a good housewife.”",lady answer odd sort apologetic tone see return housefather have good housewife 
27,"“Truly do I rejoice!” said Christina, wishing she could convey to him how welcome he had been to marry any one he liked, as far as she was concerned—he, in whom her fears of mincing goldsmiths had always taken form—then signing with her hand, “I have my sons likewise to show her.”",rejoice say wish convey welcome marry one like concerned fear mincing goldsmith take form sign hand have son show 
28,"“Ah, on foot!” muttered Grundt, as a not well-conceived apology for not having saluted the young gentlemen.  “I greet you well, sirs,” with a bow, most haughtily returned by Ebbo, who was heartily wishing himself on his mountain.  “Two lusty, well-grown Junkern indeed, to whom my Martin will be proud to show the humours of Ulm.  A fair good night, lady!  You will find the old folks right cheery.”",foot mutter conceive apology salute young gentleman greet bow return wish mountain lusty grow proud show humour fair good night lady find old folk cheery 
29,"Well did Christina know the turn down the street, darkened by the overhanging brows of the tall houses, but each lower window laughing with the glow of light within that threw out the heavy mullions and the circles and diamonds of the latticework, and here and there the brilliant tints of stained glass sparkled like jewels in the upper panes, pictured with Scripture scene, patron saint, or trade emblem.  The familiar porch was reached, the familiar knock resounded on the iron-studded door. Friedel lifted his mother from her horse, and felt that she was quivering from head to foot, and at the same moment the light streamed from the open door on the white horse, and the two young faces, one eager, the other with knit brows and uneasy eyes.  A kind of echo pervaded the house, “She is come! she is come!” and as one in a dream Christina entered, crossed the well-known hall, looked up to her uncle and aunt on the stairs, perceived little change on their countenances, and sank upon her knees, with bowed head and clasped hands.",know turn street darken overhang brow tall house low window laugh glow light throw heavy mullion circle diamond latticework brilliant tint stain glass sparkle jewel upper pane picture scene patron saint trade emblem familiar porch reach familiar knock resound iron studd door lift mother horse feel quiver head foot same moment light stream open door white horse young face eager other knit brow uneasy eye kind echo pervade house come come dream enter cross know hall look uncle aunt stair perceive little change countenance sink knee bow head clasp hand 
30,"“My child! my dear child!” exclaimed her uncle, raising her with one hand, and crossing her brow in benediction with the other.  “Art thou indeed returned?” and he embraced her tenderly.",child dear child exclaim uncle raise hand cross brow benediction other return embrace 
31,"“Welcome, fair niece!” said Hausfrau Johanna, more formally.  “I am right glad to greet you here.”",fair niece say glad greet 
32,"“Dear, dear mother!” cried Christina, courting her fond embrace by gestures of the most eager affection, “how have I longed for this moment! and, above all, to show you my boys!  Herr Uncle, let me present my sons—my Eberhard, my Friedmund.  O Housemother, are not my twins well-grown lads?”  And she stood with a hand on each, proud that their heads were so far above her own, and looking still so slight and girlish in figure that she might better have been their sister than their mother. The cloud that the sudden light had revealed on Ebbo’s brow had cleared away, and he made an inclination neither awkward nor ungracious in its free mountain dignity and grace, but not devoid of mountain rusticity and shy pride, and far less cordial than was Friedel’s manner.  Both were infinitely relieved to detect nothing of the greasy burgher, and were greatly struck with the fine venerable head before them; indeed, Friedel would, like his mother, have knelt to ask a blessing, had he not been under command not to outrun his brother’s advances towards her kindred.",dear dear mother cry court fond embrace gesture eager affection long moment show boy let present son twin grow lad stand hand proud head own look slight girlish figure sister mother cloud sudden light reveal brow clear make inclination awkward ungracious free mountain dignity grace devoid mountain rusticity shy pride cordial manner relieve detect greasy burgher strike fine venerable head mother knolt ask blessing command outrun brother advance kindred 
33,"“Welcome, fair Junkern!” said Master Gottfried; “welcome both for your mother’s sake and your own!  These thy sons, my little one?” he added, smiling.  “Art sure I neither dream nor see double!  Come to the gallery, and let me see thee better.”",fair say master mother sake own son little one add smile art sure dream see double come gallery let see good 
34,"And, ceremoniously giving his hand, he proceeded to lead his niece up the stairs, while Ebbo, labouring under ignorance of city forms and uncertainty of what befitted his dignity, presented his hand to his aunt with an air that half-amused, half-offended the shrewd dame.",give hand proceed lead niece stair labour ignorance city form uncertainty befit dignity present hand aunt air half amuse half offend shrewd dame 
35,"“All is as if I had left you but yesterday!” exclaimed Christina. “Uncle, have you pardoned me?  You bade me return when my work was done.”",leave yesterday exclaim pardon bid return work do 
36,"“I should have known better, child.  Such return is not to be sought on this side the grave.  Thy work has been more than I then thought of.”",know good child such return seek side grave work more think 
37,"“Ah! and now will you deem it begun—not done!” softly said Christina, though with too much heartfelt exultation greatly to doubt that all the world must be satisfied with two such boys, if only Ebbo would be his true self.",deem begin do say much heartfelt exultation doubt world satisfy such boy true self 
38,"The luxury of the house, the wainscoted and tapestried walls, the polished furniture, the lamps and candles, the damask linen, the rich array of silver, pewter, and brightly-coloured glass, were a great contrast to the bare walls and scant necessaries of Schloss Adlerstein; but Ebbo was resolved not to expose himself by admiration, and did his best to stifle Friedel’s exclamations of surprise and delight.  Were not these citizens to suppose that everything was tenfold more costly at the baronial castle?  And truly the boy deserved credit for the consideration for his mother, which made him merely reserved, while he felt like a wild eagle in a poultry-yard.  It was no small proof of his affection to forbear more interference with his mother’s happiness than was the inevitable effect of that intuition which made her aware that he was chafing and ill at ease.  For his sake, she allowed herself to be placed in the seat of honour, though she longed, as of old, to nestle at her uncle’s feet, and be again his child; but, even while she felt each acceptance of a token of respect as almost an injury to them, every look and tone was showing how much the same Christina she had returned.",luxury house wainscoted tapestried wall polished furniture lamp candle damask linen rich array silver pewter coloured glass great contrast bare wall scant necessary resolve expose admiration do good stifle exclamation surprise delight citizen suppose tenfold costly baronial castle boy deserve credit consideration mother make reserve feel wild eagle poultry yard small proof affection forbear more interference mother happiness inevitable effect intuition make aware chaf ill ease sake allow place seat honour long old nestle uncle foot child feel acceptance token respect injury look tone show much same return 
39,"In truth, though her life had been mournful and oppressed, it had not been such as to age her early.  It had been all submission, without wear and tear of mind, and too simple in its trials for care and moiling; so the fresh, lily-like sweetness of her maiden bloom was almost intact, and, much as she had undergone, her once frail health had been so braced by the mountain breezes, that, though delicacy remained, sickliness was gone from her appearance.  There was still the exquisite purity and tender modesty of expression, but with greater sweetness in the pensive brown eyes.",truth life mournful oppress such age submission wear tear mind simple trial care moiling fresh lily like sweetness maiden bloom intact much undergone frail health brace mountain breeze delicacy remain sickliness gone appearance be exquisite purity tender modesty expression great sweetness pensive brown eye 
40,"“Ah, little one!” said her uncle, after duly contemplating her; “the change is all for the better!  Thou art grown a wondrously fair dame. There will scarce be a lovelier in the Kaiserly train.”",little one say uncle contemplate change good art grow fair dame lovely train 
41,Ebbo almost pardoned his great-uncle for being his great-uncle.,pardon great uncle great uncle 
42,"“When she is arrayed as becomes the Frau Freiherrinn,” said the housewife aunt, looking with concern at the coarse texture of her black sleeve.  “I long to see our own lady ruffle it in her new gear.  I am glad that the lofty pointed cap has passed out; the coif becomes my child far better, and I see our tastes still accord as to fashion.”",array become say housewife aunt look concern coarse texture black sleeve see own lady ruffle new gear glad lofty point cap pass coif become child good see taste accord fashion 
43,"“Fashion scarce came above the Debateable Ford,” said Christina, smiling. “I fear my boys look as if they came out of the _Weltgeschichte_, for I could only shape their garments after my remembrance of the gallants of eighteen years ago.”",fashion scarce come debateable say smile fear boy look come shape garment remembrance gallant year 
44,"“Their garments are your own shaping!” exclaimed the aunt, now in an accent of real, not conventional respect.",garment own shaping exclaim aunt accent real conventional respect

46,"“Close woven, even threaded, smooth tinted!  Ah, Stina, thou didst learn something!  Thou wert not quite spoilt by the housefather’s books and carvings.”",close wove threaded smooth tinted learn spoil housefather book carving 
47,"“I cannot tell whose teachings have served me best, or been the most precious to me,” said Christina, with clasped hands, looking from one to another with earnest love.",tell teaching serve good precious say clasp hand look earnest love 
48,"“Thou art a good child.  Ah! little one, forgive me; you look so like our child that I cannot bear in mind that you are the Frau Freiherrinn.”",good child little one forgive look child bear mind 
49,"“Nay, I should deem myself in disgrace with you, did you keep me at a distance, and not _thou_ me, as your little Stina,” she fondly answered, half regretting her fond eager movement, as Ebbo seemed to shrink together with a gesture perceived by her uncle.",deem disgrace keep distance little answer half regret fond eager movement seem shrink gesture perceive uncle 
50,"“It is my young lord there who would not forgive the freedom,” he said, good-humouredly, though gravely.",young lord forgive freedom say good 
51,"“Not so,” Ebbo forced himself to say; “not so, if it makes my mother happy.”",force say make mother happy 
52,"He held up his head rather as if he thought it a fool’s paradise, but Master Gottfried answered: “The noble Freiherr is, from all I have heard, too good a son to grudge his mother’s duteous love even to burgher kindred.”",hold head think fool paradise answer noble hear good son grudge mother duteous love burgher kindred 
53,"There was something in the old man’s frank, dignified tone of grave reproof that at once impressed Ebbo with a sense of the true superiority of that wise and venerable old age to his own petulant baronial self-assertion.  He had both head and heart to feel the burgher’s victory, and with a deep blush, though not without dignity, he answered, “Truly, sir, my mother has ever taught us to look up to you as her kindest and best—”",be old man frank dignified tone grave reproof impress sense true superiority wise venerable old age own petulant baronial self assertion have head heart feel burgher victory deep blush dignity answer sir mother teach look kindest good 
54,"He was going to say “friend,” but a look into the grand benignity of the countenance completed the conquest, and he turned it into “father.” Friedel at the same instant bent his knee, exclaiming, “It is true what Ebbo says!  We have both longed for this day.  Bless us, honoured uncle, as you have blessed my mother.”",go say friend look grand benignity countenance complete conquest turn father same instant bend knee exclaim true say long day bless honoure uncle bless mother 
55,"For in truth there was in the soul of the boy, who had never had any but women to look up to, a strange yearning towards reverence, which was called into action with inexpressible force by the very aspect and tone of such a sage elder and counsellor as Master Gottfried Sorel, and he took advantage of the first opening permitted by his brother.  And the sympathy always so strong between the two quickened the like feeling in Ebbo, so that the same movement drew him on his knee beside Friedel in oblivion or renunciation of all lordly pride towards a kinsman such as he had here encountered.",truth be soul boy have woman look strange yearn reverence call action inexpressible force very aspect tone sage elder counsellor take advantage first opening permit brother sympathy strong quicken feeling same movement draw knee oblivion renunciation lordly pride kinsman such encounter 
56,"“Truly and heartily, my fair youths,” said Master Gottfried, with the same kind dignity, “do I pray the good God to bless you, and render you faithful and loving sons, not only to your mother, but to your fatherland.”",fair youth say same kind dignity pray good bless render faithful loving son mother fatherland 
57,"He was unable to distinguish between the two exactly similar forms that knelt before him, yet there was something in the quivering of Friedel’s head, which made him press it with a shade more of tenderness than the other.  And in truth tears were welling into the eyes veiled by the fingers that Friedel clasped over his face, for such a blessing was strange and sweet to him.",unable distinguish similar form knolt be quivering head make press shade more tenderness other truth tear well eye veil finger clasp face blessing strange sweet 
58,"Their mother was ready to weep for joy.  There was now no drawback to her bliss, since her son and her uncle had accepted one another; and she repaired to her own beloved old chamber a happier being than she had been since she had left its wainscoted walls.",mother ready weep joy be drawback bliss son uncle accept repair own beloved old chamber happy being leave wainscoted wall 
59,"Nay, as she gazed out at the familiar outlines of roof and tower, and felt herself truly at home, then knelt by the little undisturbed altar of her devotions, with the cross above and her own patron saint below in carved wood, and the flowers which the good aunt had ever kept as a freshly renewed offering, she felt that she was happier, more fully thankful and blissful than even in the girlish calm of her untroubled life.  Her prayer that she might come again in peace had been more than fulfilled; nay, when she had seen her boys kneel meekly to receive her uncle’s blessing, it was in some sort to her as if the work was done, as if the millstone had been borne up for her, and had borne her and her dear ones with it.",gaze familiar outline roof tower feel home knolt little undisturbed altar devotion cross own patron saint carve wood flower good aunt keep renew offering feel happy thankful blissful girlish calm untroubled life prayer come peace more fulfil see boy kneel receive uncle blessing sort work do millstone borne borne dear one
