2,"     WATCHMAN. How, if he will not stand?     DOGBERRY. Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go.                                           Much Ado about Nothing.",stand take note let go much 
3," Dr. May promised Margaret that he would see whether the black-hole of Cocksmoor was all that Norman depicted it, and, accordingly, he came home that way on Tuesday evening the next week, much to the astonishment of Richard, who was in the act of so mending the window that it might let in air when open, and keep it out when shut, neither of which purposes had it ever yet answered.",promise see black hole depict come way evening next week much astonishment act mend window let air open keep shut purpose answer 
4,"Dr. May walked in, met his daughter’s look of delight and surprise, spoke cheerfully to Mrs. Green, a hospital acquaintance of his, like half the rest of the country, and made her smile and curtsey by asking if she was not surprised at such doings in her house; then looked at the children, and patted the head that looked most fit to pat, inquired who was the best scholar, and offered a penny to whoever could spell copper tea-kettle, which being done by three merry mortals, and having made him extremely popular, he offered Ethel a lift, and carried her off between him and Adams, on whom he now depended for driving him, since Richard was going to Oxford at once.",walk meet daughter look delight surprise speak hospital acquaintance rest country make smile curtsey ask surprise such doing house look child patt head look fit pat inquire good scholar offer penny spell copper tea- kettle do merry mortal make popular offer lift carry depend drive go 
5,"It was possible to spare him now. Dr. May’s arm was as well as he expected it ever would be; he had discarded the sling, and could use his hand again, but the arm was still stiff and weak--he could not stretch it out, nor use it for anything requiring strength; it soon grew tired with writing, and his daughters feared that it ached more than he chose to confess, when they saw it resting in the breast of his waistcoat. Driving he never would have attempted again, even if he could, and he had quite given up carving--he could better bear to sit at the side than at the bottom of the dinner-table.",possible spare arm expect discard sling use hand arm stiff weak stretch use require strength grow tired writing daughter fear ach choose confess see rest breast waistcoat drive attempt give carving bear sit side bottom dinner table 
6,"Means of carrying Margaret safely had been arranged by Richard, and there was no necessity for longer delaying his going to Oxford, but he was so unwillingly spared by all, as to put him quite into good spirits. Ethel was much concerned to lose him from Cocksmoor, and dreaded hindrances to her going thither without his escort; but she had much trust in having her father on her side, and meant to get authority from him for the propriety of going alone with Mary.",means carry arrange be necessity delay go spare put good spirit concerned lose dread hindrance go escort have much trust have father side mean get authority propriety go 
7,"She did not know how Norman had jeopardised her projects, but the danger blew over. Dr. May told Margaret that the place was clean and wholesome, and though more smoky than might be preferred, there was nothing to do any one in health any harm, especially when the walk there and back was over the fresh moor. He lectured Ethel herself on opening the window, now that she could; and advised Norman to go and spend an hour in the school, that he might learn how pleasant peat-smoke was--a speech Norman did not like at all. The real touchstone of temper is ridicule on a point where we do not choose to own ourselves fastidious, and if it and been from any one but his father, Norman would not have so entirely kept down his irritation.",know jeopardise project danger blow tell place clean wholesome smoky prefer be do one health harm walk fresh moor lecture open window advise go spend hour school learn pleasant peat smoke speech like real touchstone temper ridicule point choose own fastidious one father keep irritation 
8,"Richard passed his examination successfully, and Dr. May wrote himself to express his satisfaction. Nothing went wrong just now except little Tom, who seemed to be justifying Richard’s fears of the consequence of exciting his father’s anger. At home, he shrank and hesitated at the simplest question if put by his father suddenly; and the appearance of cowardice and prevarication displeasing Dr. May further, rendered his tone louder, and frightened Tom the more, giving his manner an air of sullen reserve that was most unpleasant. At school it was much the same--he kept aloof from Norman, and threw himself more into the opposite faction, by whom he was shielded from all punishment, except what they chose themselves to inflict on him.",pass examination write express satisfaction go wrong little seem justify fear consequence exciting father anger home shrank hesitate simple question put father appearance cowardice prevarication displease render tone louder frighten more give manner air sullen reserve unpleasant school same keep throw opposite faction shield punishment choose inflict 
9,"Norman’s post as head of the school was rendered more difficult by the departure of his friend Cheviot, who had always upheld his authority; Harvey Anderson did not openly transgress, for he had a character to maintain, but it was well known throughout the school that there was a wide difference between the boys, and that Anderson thought it absurd, superfluous, and troublesome in May not to wink at abuses which appeared to be licensed by long standing. When Edward Anderson, Axworthy, and their set, broke through rules, it was with the understanding that the second boy in the school would support them, if he durst.",post head school render difficult departure friend upheld authority transgress have character maintain know school be wide difference boy think absurd superfluous troublesome wink abuse appear license long standing set break rule understanding second boy school support durst 
10,"The summer and the cricket season brought the battle of Ballhatchet’s house to issue. The cricket ground was the field close to it, and for the last two or three years there had been a frequent custom of despatching juniors to his house for tarts and ginger-beer bottles. Norman knew of instances last year in which this had led to serious mischief, and had made up his mind that, at whatever loss of popularity, it was his duty to put a stop to the practice.",summer cricket season bring battle house issue cricket ground field last year be frequent custom despatch junior house tart ginger beer bottle know instance last year lead serious mischief make mind loss popularity duty put stop practice 
11,"He was an ardent cricketer himself, and though the game did not, in anticipation, seem to him to have all the charms of last year, he entered into it with full zest when once engaged. But his eye was on all parts of the field, and especially on the corner by the bridge, and the boys knew him well enough to attempt nothing unlawful within the range of that glance. However, the constant vigilance was a strain too great to be always kept up, and he had reason to believe he was eluded more than once.",ardent cricketer game anticipation seem have charm last year enter full zest engage eye part field corner bridge boy know attempt unlawful range glance constant vigilance strain great keep have reason believe elude more 
12,"At last came a capture, something like that of Tom, one which he could not have well avoided making. The victim was George Larkins, the son of a clergyman in the neighbourhood, a wild, merry varlet, who got into mischief rather for the sake of the fun than from any bad disposition.",last come capture avoid make victim son clergyman neighbourhood wild merry varlet get mischief sake fun bad disposition 
13,"His look of consternation was exaggerated into a most comical caricature, in order to hide how much of it was real.",look consternation exaggerate comical caricature order hide much real

18,"The boy made such absurd faces, that Norman could hardly help laughing, though he wished to make it a serious affair. “You know, Larkins, I have given out that such things are not to be. It is a melancholy fact.”",boy make such absurd face help laugh wish make serious affair know give such thing melancholy fact 
19,"“Ay, so you must make an example of me!” said Larkins, pretending to look resigned. “Better call all the fellows together, hadn’t you, and make it more effective? It would be grateful to one’s feelings, you know; and June,” added he, with a ridiculous confidential air, “if you’ll only lay it on soft, I’ll take care it makes noise enough. Great cry, little wool, you know.”",make example say pretend look resign call fellow make effective grateful feeling know add ridiculous confidential air lay soft take care make noise great cry little wool know

Only let me send home for old Neptune’s chain, if you please, sir--if you hang me in the combined watch-chains of the school, I fear they would give way and defeat the purposes of justice.”",gibbet gibbet cry turn spot crime take place warning beholder let send home old chain sir hang combine watch chain school fear give way defeat purpose justice 
26,"They were by this time at the bridge. “Come in,” said Norman to his follower, as he crossed the entrance of the little shop, the first time he had ever been there. A little cringing shrivelled old man stood up in astonishment.",time bridge come say follower cross entrance little shop first time little cring shrivell old man stand astonishment

31,"“Spirits! bless you, sir, I never thought of no sich a thing! ‘Tis nothing in life but ginger-beer--very cooling drink, sir, of my wife’s making; she had the receipt from her grandmother up in Leicestershire. Won’t you taste a bottle, sir?” and he hastily made a cork bounce, and poured it out.",spirit bless sir think thing tis life ginger beer cooling drink sir wife making have receipt grandmother taste bottle sir make cork bounce pour

I wonder you are not ashamed of such a charge!”",give warning say next time find bottle school field licence go be goods give pence wonder ashamed charge 
41,"Having extracted the money, Norman turned to leave the shop. Larkins, triumphant, “Ha! there’s Harrison!” as the tutor rode by, and they touched their caps. “How he stared! My eyes! June, you’ll be had up for dealing with old Ball!” and he went into an ecstasy of laughing. “You’ve settled him, I believe. Well, is justice satisfied?”",extract money turn leave shop triumphant be tutor ride touch cap stare eye have deal old ball go ecstasy laugh settle believe justice satisfy

47,"Larkins pinched his fingers; home was a string that could touch him, but it seemed beneath him to own it. At that moment a carriage approached, the boy’s whole face lighted up, and he jumped forward. “Our own!” he cried. “There she is!”",pinch finger home string touch seem own moment carriage approach boy whole face light jump own cry 
48,"She was, of course, his mother; and Norman, though turning hastily away that his presence might prove no restraint, saw the boy fly over the door of the open carriage, and could have sobbed at the thought of what that meeting was.",course mother turn presence prove restraint see boy fly door open carriage sobb thought meeting

53,"It was not fruitless; Larkins did avoid mischief when it was not extremely inviting, was more amenable to May senior, and having been put in mind by him of his home, was not ashamed to bring the thought to the aid of his eyes, when, on Sunday, during a long sermon of Mr. Ramsden’s, he knew that Axworthy was making the grimace which irresistibly incited him to make a still finer one.",fruitless avoid mischief invite amenable senior put mind home ashamed bring thought aid eye long sermon know make grimace incite make finer one 
54,"And Ballhatchet was so much convinced of “that there young May” being in earnest, that he assured his persuasive customers that it was as much as his licence was worth to supply them.",convinced young earnest assure persuasive customer much licence worth supply 
55,"Evil and insubordination were more easily kept under than Norman had expected, when he first made up his mind to the struggle. Firmness had so far carried the day, and the power of manful assertion of the right had been proved, contrary to Cheviot’s parting auguries, that he would only make himself disliked, and do no good.",evil insubordination keep expect make mind struggle firmness carry day power manful assertion right prove contrary parting augury make dislike do good 
56,"The whole of the school was extremely excited this summer by a proceeding of Mr. Tomkins, the brewer, who suddenly closed up the footway called Randall’s Alley, declaring that there was no right of passage through a certain field at the back of his brewery. Not only the school, but the town was indignant, and the Mays especially so. It had been the doctor’s way to school forty years ago, and there were recollections connected with it that made him regard it with personal affection. Norman, too, could not bear to lose it; he had not entirely conquered his reluctance to pass that spot in the High Street, and the loss of the alley would be a positive deprivation to him. Almost every native of Stoneborough felt strongly the encroachment of the brewer, and the boys, of course, carried the sentiment to exaggeration.",whole school excited summer proceeding brewer close footway call declare be right passage certain field back brewery school town indignant doctor way school year be recollection connect make regard personal affection bear lose conquer reluctance pass spot high loss alley positive deprivation native feel encroachment brewer boy course carry sentiment exaggeration 
57,"The propensity to public speaking perhaps added to the excitement, for Norman May and Harvey Anderson, for once in unison, each made a vehement harangue in the school-court--Anderson’s a fine specimen of the village Hampden style, about Britons never suffering indignities, and free-born Englishmen swelling at injuries.",propensity public speak add excitement unison make vehement harangue school court fine specimen village style suffer indignity free bear swell injury 
58,"“That they do, my hearty,” interjected Larkins, pointing to an inflamed eye that had not returned to its right dimensions. However, Anderson went on unmoved by the under titter, and demonstrated, to the full satisfaction of all the audience, that nothing could be more illegal and unfounded than the brewer’s claims.",hearty interject point inflamed eye return right dimension go unmoved titter demonstrate full satisfaction audience illegal unfounded brewer claim 
59,"Then came a great outburst from Norman, with all his father’s headlong vehemence; the way was the right of the town, the walk had been trodden by their forefathers for generations past--it had been made by the good old generous-hearted man who loved his town and townspeople, and would have heard with shame and anger of a stranger, a new inhabitant, a grasping radical, caring, as radicals always did, for no rights, but for their own chance of unjust gains, coming here to Stoneborough to cut them off from their own path. He talk of liberalism and the rights of the poor! He who cut off Randall’s poor old creatures in the almshouses from their short way! and then came some stories of his oppression as a poor-law guardian, which greatly aggravated the wrath of the speaker and audience, though otherwise they did not exactly bear on the subject.",come great outburst father headlong vehemence way right town walk trodd forefather generation make good old generous hearted man love town townspeople hear shame anger stranger new inhabitant grasp radical care radical right own chance unjust gain come cut own path talk liberalism right poor cut poor old creature almshouse short way come story oppression poor law guardian aggravate wrath speaker audience bear subject 
60,“What would old Nicholas Randall say to these nineteenth-century doings?” finished Norman.,old say nineteenth century doing finish 
61,"“Down, with them!” cried a voice from the throng, probably Larkins’s; but there was no desire to investigate, it was the universal sentiment. “Down with it! Hurrah, we’ll have our footpath open again! Down with the fences! Britons never shall be slaves!” as Larkins finally ejaculated.",cry voice throng be desire investigate universal sentiment have footpath open fence slave ejaculate 
62,"“That’s the way to bring it to bear!” said Harvey Anderson, “See if he dares to bring an action against us. Hurrah!”",way bring bear say see dare bring action

64,"Carried along by the general feeling, the whole troop of boys dashed shouting up to the barricade at the entrance of the field, and levelled it with the ground. A handkerchief was fastened to the top of one of the stakes, and waved over the brewhouse wall, and some of the boys were for picking up stones and dirt, and launching them over, in hopes of spoiling the beer; but Norman put a stop to this, and brought them back to the school-yard, still in a noisy state of exultation.",carry general feeling whole troop boy dash shouting barricade entrance field levell ground handkerchief fasten top stake wave brewhouse wall boy pick stone dirt launch hope spoil beer put stop bring school yard noisy state exultation 
65,"It cooled a little by-and-by under the doubt how their exploit would be taken. At home, Norman found it already known, and his father half glad, half vexed, enjoying the victory over Tomkins, yet a little uneasy on his son’s behalf. “What will Dr. Hoxton say to the dux?” said he. “I didn’t know he was to be dux in mischief as well as out of it.”",cool little doubt exploit take home find know father glad half vex enjoy victory little uneasy son behalf say dux say know dux mischief

69,"“Oratory,” said the doctor, smiling. “Ha, Norman! Think a little another time, my boy, before you take the law into your own hands, or, what is worse, into a lot of hands you can’t control for good, though you may excite them to harm.”",say doctor smile think little time boy take law own hand bad lot hand control good excite harm

71,"He looked very broad, awful, and dignified, as he informed him that Mr. Tomkins had just been with him to complain of the damage that had been done, and he appeared extremely displeased that the dux should have been no check on such proceedings.",look broad awful dignified inform complain damage do appear displeased dux check such proceedings 
72,"“I am sorry, sir,” said Norman, “but I believe it was the general feeling that he had no right to stop the alley, and, therefore, that it could not be wrong to break it down.”",sorry sir say believe general feeling have right stop alley wrong break 
73,"“Whether he has a right or not is not a question to be settled by you. So I find that you, whose proper office it is to keep order, have been inflaming the mischievous and aggressive spirit amongst the others. I am surprised at you; I thought you were more to be depended upon, May, in your position.”",have right question settle find proper office keep order inflame mischievous aggressive spirit other surprise think more depend position

80,"“Who cares for the credit of the school?” said the elder Anderson; “we are out of the school now--we are townsmen--Stoneborough boys--citizens not bound to submit to injustice. No, no, the old rogue knew it would not stand if it was brought into court, so he brings down old Hoxton on us instead--a dirty trick he deserves to be punished for.”",care credit school say elder school townsmen boy citizen bind submit injustice old rogue know stand bring court bring old dirty trick deserve punish

84,"“It is of no use to rave about old Tomkins,” proceeded Norman, in his style of popular oratory. “If it is illegal, some one will go to law about it, and we shall have our alley again. We have shown him our mind once, and that is enough; if we let him alone now, he will see ‘tis only because we are ordered, not for his sake. It would be just putting him in the right, and maybe winning his cause for him, to use any more violence. There’s law for you, Anderson. So now no more about it--let us all go home like rational fellows. August, where’s August?”",use rave old proceed style popular oratory illegal one go law have alley show mind enough let see order sake put right win cause use more violence be law more let go rational fellow 
85,"Tom was not visible--he generally avoided going home with his brother; and Norman having seen the boys divide into two or three little parties, as their roads lay homewards, found he had an hour of light for an expedition of his own, along the bank of the river. He had taken up botany with much ardour, and sharing the study with Margaret was a great delight to both. There was a report that the rare yellow bog-bean grew in a meadow about a mile and a half up the river, and thither he was bound, extremely enjoying the summer evening walk, as the fresh dewy coolness sunk on all around, and the noises of the town were mellowed by distance, and the sun’s last beams slanted on the green meadows, and the May-flies danced, and dragon-flies darted, and fish rose or leaped high in the air, or showed their spotted sides, and opened and shut their gills, as they rested in the clear water, and the evening breeze rustled in the tall reeds, and brought fragrance from the fresh-mown hay.",visible avoid go brother see boy divide little party road lay homeward find have hour light expedition own bank river take botany much ardour share study great delight be report rare yellow bog bean grow meadow mile half river bind enjoy summer evening walk fresh dewy coolness sink noise town mellow distance sun last beam slant green meadow fly dance dragon fly dart fish rise leap air show spot side open shut gill rest clear water evening breeze rustle tall reed bring fragrance fresh mown hay 
86,"It was complete enjoyment to Norman after his day’s study and the rule and watch over the unruly crowd of boys, and he walked and wandered and collected plants for Margaret till the sun was down, and the grasshoppers chirped clamorously, while the fern-owl purred, and the beetle hummed, and the skimming swallows had given place to the soft-winged bat, and the large white owl floating over the fields as it moused in the long grass.",complete enjoyment day study rule watch unruly crowd boy walk wander collect plant sun grasshopper chirp fern owl purr beetle humm skimming swallow give place soft winged bat large white owl float field mouse long grass 
87,"The summer twilight was sobering every tint, when, as Norman crossed the cricket-field, he heard, in the distance, a loud shout. He looked up, and it seemed to him that he saw some black specks dancing in the forbidden field, and something like the waving of a flag, but it was not light enough to be certain, and he walked quickly home.",summer twilight sober tint cross cricket field hear distance loud shout look seem see black speck dance forbidden field wave flag light certain walk

94,"“Yes, do,” said Dr. May. “The boy is never off one’s mind.”",do say boy mind 
95,"A sort of instinctive dread directed Norman’s steps down the open portion of Randall’s Alley, and, voices growing louder as he came nearer, confirmed his suspicions. The fence at this end was down, and, on entering the field, a gleam of light met his eye on the ground--a cloud of smoke, black figures were flitting round it, pushing brands into red places, and feeding the bonfire.",sort instinctive dread direct step open portion voice grow louder come confirm suspicion fence end enter field gleam light meet eye ground cloud smoke black figure flit push brand red place feed bonfire

101,"A general hurry-skurry ensued. Norman alone, strong in innocence, walked quietly away, and, as he came forth from the darkness of the alley, beheld something scouring away before him, in the direction of home. It popped in at the front door before him, but was not in the drawing-room. He strode upstairs, called, but was not answered, and found, under the bedclothes, a quivering mass, consisting of Tom, with all his clothes on, fully persuaded that it was the policeman who was pursuing him.",general hurry skurry ensue strong innocence walk come darkness alley beheld scour direction home pop front door draw room strode call answer find bedclothe quiver mass consist clothes persuade policeman pursue
