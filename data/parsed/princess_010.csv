1,CHAPTER X. THE PRINCESS'S KING-PAPA,princess 
2," THE weather continued fine for weeks, and the little princess went out every day. So long a period of fine weather had indeed never been known upon that mountain. The only uncomfortable thing was that her nurse was so nervous and particular about being in before the sun was down, that often she would take to her heels when nothing worse than a fleecy cloud crossing the sun threw a shadow on the hillside; and many an evening they were home a full hour before the sunlight had left the weathercock on the stables. If it had not been for such behavior, Irene would by this time have almost forgotten the goblins. She never forgot Curdie, but him she remembered for his own sake, and indeed would have remembered him if only because a princess never forgets her debts until they are paid.",weather continue fine week little princess go day period fine weather know mountain only uncomfortable thing nurse nervous particular sun take heel bad fleecy cloud cross sun throw shadow hillside many evening full hour sunlight leave weathercock stable such behavior time forget goblin forget remember own sake remember princess forget debt pay

4,"One splendid sunshiny day, about an hour after noon, Irene, who was playing on a lawn in the garden, heard the distant blast of a bugle. She jumped up with a cry of joy, for she knew by that particular blast that her father was on his way to see her. This part of the garden lay on the slope of the hill, and allowed a full view of the country below. So she shaded her eyes with her hand, and looked far away to catch the first glimpse of shining armor. In a few moments a little troop came glittering round the shoulder of a hill. Spears and helmets were sparkling and gleaming, banners were flying, horses prancing, and again came the bugle-blast, which was to her like the voice of her father calling across the distance, ""Irene, I'm coming."" On and on they came, until she could clearly distinguish the king. He rode a white horse, and was taller than any of the men with him. He wore a narrow circle of gold set with jewels around his helmet, and as he came still nearer, Irene could discern the flashing of the stones in the sun. It was a long time since he had been to see her, and her little heart beat faster and faster as the shining troop approached, for she loved her king-papa very dearly, and was nowhere so happy as in his arms. When they reached a certain point, after which she could see them no more from the garden, she ran to the gate, and there stood till up they came clanging and stamping, with one more bright bugle-blast which said, ""Irene, I am come.""",splendid sunshiny day hour noon play lawn garden hear distant blast bugle jump cry joy know particular blast father way see part garden lay slope hill allow full view country shade eye hand look catch first glimpse shine armor few moment little troop come glitter shoulder hill helmet sparkling gleam banner fly horse prance come bugle blast voice father call distance come come distinguish king ride white horse tall man wear narrow circle gold set jewel helmet come discern flash stone sun long time see little heart beat fast fast shine troop approach love king papa happy arm reach certain point see garden run gate stand come clang stamp bright bugle blast say come 
5,"By this time the people of the house were all gathered at the gate, but Irene stood alone in front of them. When the horseman pulled up, she ran to the side of the white horse, and held up her arms. The king stooped, and took her hands. In an instant she was on the saddle, and clasped in his great strong arms. I wish I could describe the king, so that you could see him in your mind. He had gentle blue eyes, but a nose that made him look like an eagle. A long dark beard, streaked with silvery lines, flowed from his mouth almost to his waist, and as Irene sat on the saddle and hid her glad face upon his bosom, it mingled with the golden hair which her mother had given her, and the two together were like a cloud with streaks of the sun woven through it. After he had held her to his heart for a minute, he spoke to his white horse, and the great beautiful creature, which had been prancing so proudly a little while before, walked as gently as a lady--for he knew he had a little lady on his back--through the gate and up to the door of the house. Then the king set her on the ground, and, dismounting, took her hand and walked with her into the great hall, which was hardly ever entered except when he came to see his little princess. There he sat down with two of his councillors who had accompanied him, to have some refreshment, and Irene bestowed herself on his right hand, and drank her milk out of a wooden bowl curiously carved.",time person house gather gate stand front horseman pull run side white horse hold arm king stoop take hand instant saddle clasp great strong arm wish describe king see mind have gentle blue eye nose make look eagle long dark beard streak silvery line flow mouth waist sit saddle hide glad face bosom mingle golden hair mother give cloud streak sun wove hold heart minute speak white horse great beautiful creature prance little while walk lady know have little lady back gate door house king set ground dismount take hand walk great hall enter come see little princess sit councillor accompany have refreshment bestow right hand drink milk wooden bowl carve 
6,"After the king had eaten and drunk, he turned to the princess and said, stroking her hair--",king eat drunk turn princess say stroke hair 
7,"""Now, my child, what shall we do next?""",child do 
8,"This was the question he almost always put to her first after their meal together; and Irene had been waiting for it with some impatience, for now, she thought, she should be able to settle a question which constantly perplexed her.",question put first meal wait impatience think able settle question perplex

17,"At that moment a snow-white pigeon flew in at an open window and, with a flutter, settled upon Irene's head. She broke into a merry laugh, cowered a little and put up her hands to her head, saying--",moment snow white pigeon fly open window flutter settle head break merry laugh cower little put hand head say 
18,"""Dear dovey, don't peck me. You'll pull out my hair with your long claws, if you don't have a care.""",dear dovey peck pull hair long claw have care 
19,"The king stretched out his hand to take the pigeon, but it spread its wings and flew again through the open window, when its whiteness made one flash in the sun and vanished. The king laid his hand on the princess's head, held it back a little, gazed in her face, smiled half a smile and sighed half a sigh.",king stretch hand take pigeon spread wing fly open window whiteness make flash sun vanish king lay hand princess head hold little gaze face smile smile sigh sigh 
20,"""Come, my child; we'll have a walk in the garden together,"" he said.",come child have walk garden say 
21,"""You won't come up and see my huge, great, beautiful grandmother, then, king-papa?"" said the princess.",come see huge great beautiful grandmother king papa say princess

23,"The garden was a very lovely place. Being upon a mountain side, there were parts in it where the rocks came through in great masses, and all immediately about them remained quite wild. Tufts of heather grew upon them, and other hardy mountain plants and flowers, while near them would be lovely roses and lilies, and all pleasant garden flowers. This mingling of the wild mountain with the civilized garden was very quaint, and it was impossible for any number of gardeners to make such a garden look formal and stiff.",garden lovely place mountain side be part rock come great mass remain wild tuft heather grow other hardy mountain plant flower lovely rose lilie pleasant garden flower mingling wild mountain civilized garden quaint impossible number gardener make garden look formal stiff 
24,"Against one of these rocks was a garden-seat, shadowed, from the afternoon sun by the overhanging of the rock itself. There was a little winding path up to the top of the rock, and on the top another seat; but they sat on the seat at its foot, because the sun was hot; and there they talked together of many things. At length the king said:",rock garden seat shadow afternoon sun overhanging rock be little wind path top rock top seat sit seat foot sun hot talk many thing length king say

29,"""Once might be too often,"" murmured the king to himself, as he stroked his child's head.",murmure king stroke child head 
30,"I cannot tell you how he had come to know. I am sure Curdie had not told him. Some one about the palace must have seen them, after all. He sat for a good while thinking. There was no sound to be heard except that of a little stream which ran merrily out of an opening in the rock by where they sat, and sped away down the hill through the garden. Then he rose, and leaving Irene where she was, went into the house and sent for Lootie, with whom he had a talk that made her cry.",tell come know sure tell one palace see sit good while think be sound hear little stream run opening rock sit spe hill garden rise leave go house send have talk make cry 
31,"When in the evening he rode away upon his great white horse, he left six of his attendants behind him, with orders that three of them should watch outside the house every night, walking round and round it from sunset to sunrise. It was clear he was not quite comfortable about the princess.",evening ride great white horse leave attendant order watch house night walk sunset sunrise clear comfortable princess
