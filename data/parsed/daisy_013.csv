33,"Unwilling as he had been to give way, it was a relief to relinquish the struggle to think himself well, and to venture to lounge and dawdle, rest his heavy head, and stretch his inert limbs without fear of remark.

43,"Norman found the baby in his sister’s room, and this was just what suited him. The Daisy showed a marked preference for her brothers; and to find her so merry and good with him, pleased and flattered him far more than his victory at school. He carried her about, danced her, whistled to her, and made her admire her pretty blue eyes in the glass most successfully, till nurse carried her off. But perhaps he had been sent up rather too soon, for as he sat in the great chair by the fire, he was teased by the constant coming and going, all the petty cares of a large household transacted by Margaret--orders to butcher and cook--Harry racing in to ask to take Tom to the river--Tom, who was to go when his lesson was done, coming perpetually to try to repeat the same unhappy bit of ‘As in Proesenti’, each time in a worse whine.",find baby sister room suit show mark preference brother find merry good pleased flatter more victory school carry dance whistle make admire pretty blue eye glass nurse carry send sit great chair fire tease constant come go petty care large household transact order butcher cook racing ask take river go lesson do come try repeat same unhappy bit time bad whine

I hope I was not cross with poor Mary, but it was rather too much to ask.”",boy dream add depart disconsolate give sigh weariness say return work believe do hope cross poor much ask

54,"“There’s the question. I believe papa thinks I might be lifted to the sofa now--and oh! how I long for it--but then Mr. Ward does not approve of my sitting up, even as I am doing now, and wants to keep me flat. Papa thinks that of no use, and likely to hurt my general health, and I believe the end of it will be that he will ask Sir Matthew Fleet’s opinion.”",be question believe papa think lift sofa approve sitting do want keep flat think use likely hurt general health believe end ask opinion

I believe it would be a great treat to papa to have him, and it would be a good thing for papa too; I don’t think his arm is going on right--he does not trust to Mr. Ward’s treatment, and I am sure some one else ought to see it.”",know go university meet set grow famous believe great treat papa have good thing papa think arm go trust treatment sure one else see

70,"Richard and Ethel were glad of a walk, for Margaret had found them a pleasant errand. Their Cocksmoor children could not go home to dinner between service and afternoon school, and Margaret had desired the cook to serve them up some broth in the back kitchen, to which the brother and sister were now to invite them. Mary was allowed to take her boots to Rebekah Watts, since Margaret held that goodness had better be profitable, at least at the outset; and Harry and Tom joined the party.",glad walk find pleasant errand child go dinner service afternoon school desire cook serve broth back kitchen brother sister invite allow take boot hold goodness profitable least outset join party 
71,"Norman, meantime, was driving his father--a holiday preferment highly valued in the days when Dr. May used only to assume the reins, when his spirited horses showed too much consciousness that they had a young hand over them, or when the old hack took a fit of laziness. Now, Norman needed Richard’s assurance that the bay was steady, so far was he from being troubled with his ancient desire, that the steed would rear right up on his hind legs.",drive father holiday preferment value day use assume rein spirit horse show much consciousness have young hand old hack take fit laziness need assurance bay steady trouble ancient desire steed rear hind leg 
72,"He could neither talk nor listen till he was clear out of the town, and found himself master of the animal, and even then the words were few, and chiefly spoken by Dr. May, until after going along about three miles of the turnpike road, he desired Norman to turn down a cross-country lane.",talk listen clear town find master animal word few speak go mile road desire turn cross-country lane

79,"Norman followed his father down a steep narrow lane, little better than a stony water-course, and began to repeat, “If you would but let me do my work! I’ve got nothing else to do, and now they have put me up, I should not like not to keep my place.”",follow father steep narrow lane little good stony water course begin repeat let do work get else do put like keep place 
80,"“Very likely, but--hollo--how swelled this is!” said Dr. May, as they came to the bottom of the valley, where a stream rushed along, coloured with a turbid creamy yellow, making little whirlpools where it crossed the road, and brawling loudly just above where it roared and foamed between two steep banks of rock, crossed by a foot-bridge of planks, guarded by a handrail of rough poles. The doctor had traversed it, and gone a few paces beyond, when, looking back, he saw Norman very pale, with one foot on the plank, and one hand grasping the rail. He came back, and held out his hand, which Norman gladly caught at, but no sooner was the other side attained, than the boy, though he gasped with relief, exclaimed, “This is too bad!

You are not fit,” he added, as the boy came to him reluctantly.",try first touch shaking rail glance chasm disconcert father see white cheek rigid lip say stop try fit add boy come 
82,"“I can’t bear to be such a wretch!” said he. “I never used to be. I will not--let me conquer it;” and he was turning back, but the doctor took his arm, saying decidedly, “No, I won’t have it done. You are only making it worse by putting a force on yourself.” But the farther Norman was from the bridge, the more displeased he was with himself, and more anxious to dare it again. “There’s no bearing it,” he muttered; “let me only run back. I’ll overtake you. I must do it if no one looks on.”",bear wretch say use let conquer turn doctor take arm say have do make bad put force far bridge displease anxious dare be bear mutter let run overtake do look

93,"“Thank you, papa. I know you mean it for my good, but I don’t think you do know how horrid it is. I have got nothing on earth to do or care for--the school work comes quite easy to me, and I’m sure thinking is worse; and then”--Norman spoke vehemently--“now they have put me up, it will never do to be beaten, and all the four others ought to be able to do it. I did not want or expect to be dux, but now I am, you could not bear me not to keep my place, and to miss the Randall scholarship, as I certainly shall, if I do not work these whole holidays.”",thank know mean good think know horrid get earth do care school work come easy sure thinking bad speak put do beat other able do want expect dux bear keep place miss scholarship work whole holiday 
94,"“Norman, I know it,” said his father kindly. “I am very sorry for you, and I know I am asking of you what I could not have done at your age--indeed, I don’t believe I could have done it for you a few months ago. It is my fault that you have been let alone, to have an overstrain and pressure on your mind, when you were not fit for it, and I cannot see any remedy but complete freedom from work. At the same time, if you fret and harass yourself about being surpassed, that is, as you say, much worse for you than Latin and Greek. Perhaps I may be wrong, and study might not do you the harm I think it would; at any rate, it is better than tormenting yourself about next half year, so I will not positively forbid it, but I think you had much better let it alone. I don’t want to make it a matter of duty. I only tell you this, that you may set your mind at rest as far as I am concerned. If you do lose your place, I will consider it as my own doing, and not be disappointed.

98,"They had, in the meantime, been mounting a rising ground, clothed with stunted wood, and came out on a wide heath, brown with dead bracken; a hollow, traced by the tops of leafless trees, marked the course of the stream that traversed it, and the inequalities of ground becoming more rugged in outlines and grayer in colouring as they receded, till they were closed by a dark fir wood, beyond which rose in extreme distance the grand mass of Welsh mountain heads, purpled against the evening sky, except where the crowning peaks bore a veil of snow. Behind, the sky was pure gold, gradually shading into pale green, and then into clear light wintry blue, while the sun sitting behind two of the loftiest, seemed to confound their outlines, and blend them in one flood of soft hazy brightness. Dr. May looked at his son, and saw his face clear up, his brow expand, and his lips unclose with admiration.",meantime mount rise ground cloth stunt wood come wide heath brown dead bracken hollow trace top leafless tree mark course stream travers inequality ground become rugged outline grayer colouring reced close dark fir wood rise extreme distance grand mass welsh mountain head purple evening sky crowning peak bear veil snow sky pure gold shade pale green clear light wintry blue sun sit loftiest seem confound outline blend flood soft hazy brightness look son see face clear brow expand lip unclose admiration

102,"Dr. May went to Margaret and talked to her of Norman’s fine character, and intense affection for his mother, the determined temper, and quietly borne grief, for which the doctor seemed to have worked himself into a perfect enthusiasm of admiration; but lamenting that he could not tell what to do with him--study or no study hurt him alike--and he dreaded to see health and spirits shattered for ever. They tried to devise change of scene, but it did not seem possible just at present; and Margaret, besides her fears for Norman, was much grieved to see this added to her father’s troubles.",go talk fine character intense affection mother determined temper borne grief doctor seem work perfect enthusiasm admiration lament tell do study study hurt alike dread see health spirit shattered try devise change scene seem possible present fear grieve see add father trouble 
103,"At night Dr. May again went up to see whether Norman, whom he had moved into Margaret’s former room, were again suffering from fever. He found him asleep in a restless attitude, as if he had just dropped off, and waking almost at the instant of his entrance, he exclaimed, “Is it you? I thought it was mamma. She said it was all ambition.”",night go see move former room suffer fever find asleep restless attitude drop wake instant entrance exclaim think mamma say ambition

I hate it all the time, and I don’t know whether I can keep from thinking of it, when I have nothing to do; but I see it is wrong; I thought all ambition and nonsense was gone out of me, when I cared so little for the examination; but now I see, though I did not want to be made first, I can’t bear not to be first; and that’s the old story, just as she used to tell me to guard against ambition.

I was half in hopes you had some such notion when I came upon you, on Far-view down.”",good sort sense mother sense say doctor affect like show wonder come dream boy come resolution half hope have such notion come view

114,"“Ay,” almost sobbed Norman, “I never could before--that made me,” after a long silence, “and then I know how foolish I was, and how she would say it was wrong to make this fuss, when you did not like it, about my place, and that it was not for the sake of my duty, but of ambition.
