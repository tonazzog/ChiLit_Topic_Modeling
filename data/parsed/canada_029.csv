1,CHAPTER XXIX.,
2," Once more was the ground covered with snow to the depth of three feet. The cattle were littered down inside the inclosure of palisades round the cow-house; the sheep were driven into the inclosed sheep-fold, and the horses were put into a portion of the barn in the sheep-fold which had been parted off for them. All was made secure, and every preparation was made for the long winter. Although there had been a fall of snow, the severe frost had not yet come on. It did, however, in about a fortnight afterward, and then, according to the wishes of the Colonel, six oxen were killed for the use of the fort, and taken there by the horses on a sledge; this was the last task that they had to fulfill, and then Alfred bade adieu to the officers of the fort, as they did not expect to meet again till the winter was over. Having experienced one winter, they were more fully prepared for the second; and as Malachi, the Strawberry and John were now regular inmates of the house, for they did not keep a separate table, there was a greater feeling of security, and the monotony and dreariness were not so great as in the preceding winter: moreover, every thing was now in its place, and they had more to attend to,--two circumstances which greatly contributed to relieve the _ennui_ arising from continual confinement. The hunting parties went out as usual; only Henry, and occasionally Alfred, remained at home to attend to the stock, and to perform other offices which the increase of their establishment required. The new books brought by Henry from Montreal, and which by common consent had been laid aside for the winter's evenings, were now a great source of amusement, as Mr. Campbell read aloud a portion of them every evening. Time passed away quickly, as it always does when there is a regular routine of duties and employment, and Christmas came before they were aware of its approach.",more ground cover snow depth foot cattle litter inclosure palisadd cow house sheep drive inclose sheep fold horse put portion barn sheep fold part make secure preparation make long winter be fall snow severe frost come fortnight accord wish oxen kill use fort take horse sledge last task have fulfill bid adieu officer fort expect meet winter experience winter prepare second regular inmate house keep separate table be great feeling security monotony dreariness great preced winter thing place have more attend circumstance contribute relieve _ennui_ arise continual confinement hunting party go usual remain home attend stock perform other office increase establishment require new book bring common consent lay winter evening great source amusement read portion evening time pass do be regular routine duty employment come aware approach 
3,"It was a great comfort to Mrs. Campbell that she now always had John at home, except when he was out hunting, and on that score she had long dismissed all anxiety, as she had full confidence in Malachi; but latterly Malachi and John seldom went out alone; indeed, the old man appeared to like being in company, and his misanthropy had wholly disappeared. He now invariably spent his evenings with the family assembled round the kitchen fire, and had become much more fond of hearing his own voice. John did not so much admire these evening parties. He cared nothing for new books, or indeed any books. He would amuse himself making moccasins, or working porcupine quills with the Strawberry at one corner of the fire, and the others might talk or read, it was all the same, John never said a word or appeared to pay the least attention to what was said. His father occasionally tried to make him learn something, but it was useless. He would remain for hours with his book before him, but his mind was elsewhere. Mr. Campbell, therefore, gave up the attempt for the present, indulging the hope that when John was older, he would be more aware of the advantages of education, and would become more attentive. At present, it was only inflicting pain on the boy without any advantage being gained. But John did not always sit by the kitchen fire. The wolves were much more numerous than in the preceding winter, having been attracted by the sheep which were within the palisade, and every night the howling was incessant. The howl of a wolf was sufficient to make John seize his rifle and leave the house, and he would remain in the snow for hours till one came sufficiently near for him to fire, and he had already killed several when a circumstance occurred which was the cause of great uneasiness.",great comfort have home hunt score dismiss anxiety have full confidence go old man appear like company misanthropy disappear spend evening family assemble kitchen fire become fond hear own voice admire evening party care new book book amuse make moccasin work porcupine quill corner fire other talk read same say word appear pay least attention say father try make learn useless remain hour book mind give attempt present indulg hope old aware advantage education become attentive present inflict pain boy advantage gain sit kitchen fire wolf numerous preced winter attract sheep palisade night howling incessant howl wolf sufficient make seize rifle leave house remain snow hour come fire kill several circumstance occur cause great uneasiness 
4,"John was out one evening as usual, crouched down within the palisades, and watching for the wolves. It was a bright starry night, but there was no moon, when he perceived one of the animals crawling along almost on its belly, close to the door of the palisade which surrounded the house. This surprised him, as generally speaking, the animals prowled round the palisade which encircled the sheep-fold, or else close to the pig-sties which were at the opposite side from the entrance door. John leveled his rifle and fired, when to his astonishment, the wolf appeared to spring up in the air on his hind legs, then fall down and roll away. The key of the palisade door was always kept within, and John determined to go in and fetch it, that he might ascertain whether he had killed the animal or not. When he entered, Malachi said, ""Did you kill, my boy?""",evening usual crouch palisadd watch wolf bright starry night be moon perceive animal crawl belly close door palisade surround house surprise speak animal prowl palisade encircle sheep fold pig-sty opposite side entrance door level rifle fire astonishment wolf appear spring air hind leg fall roll key palisade door keep determine go fetch ascertain kill animal enter say kill boy

10,"""Well, I shouldn't wonder,"" replied Malachi; ""at all events the gate must not be opened to-night, for if it was an Indian you fired at, there is more than one of them; we'll keep all fast, John, and see what it was to-morrow.""",wonder reply event gate open night fire be more keep see 
11,"Mrs. Campbell and the girls were much alarmed at this event, and it was with difficulty that they were persuaded to retire to rest.",girl alarm event difficulty persuade retire rest 
12,"""We will keep watch to-night at all events,"" said Malachi, as soon as Mrs. Campbell and her nieces had left the room. ""The boy is right, I have no doubt. It is the Angry Snake and his party who are prowling about, but if the boy has hit the Indian, which I have no doubt of, they will make off; however, it will be just as well to be on our guard, nevertheless. Martin can watch here and I will watch in the fold.""",keep watch night event say niece leave room boy right have doubt angry party prowl boy hit have doubt make guard watch watch fold 
13,"We have before observed that the lodge of Malachi, Martin, and his wife, was built within the palisade of the sheep-fold, and that there was a passage from the palisade round the house to that which surrounded the sheep-fold, which passage had also a palisade on each side of it.",observe lodge wife build palisade sheep fold be passage palisade house surround sheep fold passage have palisade side

16,"""Well, perhaps that will be better,"" said Malachi; ""two rifles are better than one, and if any assistance is required, there will be one to send for it.""",good say rifle good assistance require be send 
17,"""But what do you think they would do, Malachi?"" said Mr. Campbell; ""they can not climb the palisades.""",think do say climb palisadd 
18,"""Not well, sir, nor do I think they would attempt it unless they had a large force, which I am sure they have not; no, sir, they would rather endeavor to set fire to the house if they could, but that's not so easy; one thing is certain, that the Snake will try all he can to get possession of what he saw in your storehouse.""",sir think attempt have large force sure sir endeavor set fire house easy thing certain try get possession see storehouse 
19,"""That I do not doubt,"" said Alfred; ""but he will not find it so easy a matter.""",doubt say find easy matter 
20,"""They've been reconnoitering, sir, that's the truth of it, and if John has helped one of them to a bit of lead, it will do good; for it will prove that we are on the alert, and make them careful how they come near the house again.""",reconnoiter sir truth help bit lead do good prove alert make careful come house 
21,"After a few minutes' more conversation, Mr. Campbell, Henry, and Percival retired, leaving the others to watch. Alfred walked home with Malachi and his party to see if all was right at the sheep-fold, and then returned.",few minute more conversation retire leave other watch walk party see right sheep fold return 
22,"The night passed without any further disturbance except the howling of the wolves, to which they were accustomed.",night pass further disturbance howling wolf accustom 
23,"The next morning, at daybreak, Malachi and Martin came to the house, and, with John and Alfred, they opened the palisade gate, and went out to survey the spot where John had fired.",next morning daybreak come house open palisade gate go survey spot fire 
24,"""Yes, sir,"" said Malachi; ""it was an Indian, no doubt of it; here are the dents made in the snow by his knees as he crawled along, and John has hit him, for here is the blood. Let's follow the trail. See, sir, he has been hard hit; there is more blood this way as we go on. Ha!"" continued Malachi, as he passed by a mound of snow, ""here's the wolf-skin he was covered up with; then he is dead or thereabouts, and they have carried him off, for he never would have parted with his skin, if he had had his senses about him.""",sir say indian doubt dent make snow knee crawl hit blood let follow trail see sir hard hit be more blood way go continue pass mound snow wolf skin cover dead thereabouts carry part skin have sense 
25,"""Yes,"" observed Martin, ""his wound was mortal, that's certain.""",observe wound mortal certain 
26,"They pursued the track till they arrived at the forest, and then, satisfied by the marks on the snow that the wounded man had been carried away, they returned to the house, when they found the rest of the family dressed and in the kitchen. Alfred showed them the skin of the wolf, and informed them of what they had discovered.",pursue track arrive forest satisfy mark snow wound man carry return house find rest family dress kitchen show skin wolf inform discover 
27,"""I am grieved that blood has been shed,"" observed Mrs. Campbell; ""I wish it had not happened. I have heard that the Indians never forgive on such occasions.""",grieve blood shed observe wish happen hear forgive such occasion 
28,"""Why, ma'am, they are very revengeful, that's certain, but still they won't like to risk too much. This has been a lesson to them. I only wish it had been the Angry Snake himself who was settled, as then we should have no more trouble or anxiety about them.""",revengeful certain like risk much lesson wish angry settle have more trouble anxiety 
29,"""Perhaps it may be,"" said Alfred.",say 
30,"""No, sir, that's not likely; it's one of his young men; I know the Indian customs well.""",sir likely young man know indian custom 
31,"It was some time before the alarm occasioned by this event subsided in the mind of Mrs. Campbell and her nieces; Mr. Campbell also thought much about it, and betrayed occasional anxiety. The parties went out hunting as before, but those at home now felt anxious till their return from the chase. Time, however, and not hearing any thing more of the Indians, gradually revived their courage, and before the winter was half over they thought little about it. Indeed, it had been ascertained by Malachi from another band of Indians which he fell in with near a small lake where they were trapping beaver, that the Angry Snake was not in that part of the country, but had gone with his band to the westward at the commencement of the new year. This satisfied them that the enemy had left immediately after the attempt which he had made to reconnoiter the premises.",time alarm occasion event subside mind niece think much betray occasional anxiety party go hunt home feel anxious return chase time hear thing more revive courage winter half think little ascertain band fall small lake trapp beaver angry part country go band westward commencement new year satisfy enemy leave attempt make reconnoiter premise 
32,"The hunting parties, therefore, as we said, continued as before; indeed, they were necessary for the supply of so many mouths. Percival, who had grown very much since his residence in Canada, was very anxious to be permitted to join them, which he never had been during the former winter. This was very natural. He saw his younger brother go out almost daily, and seldom return without having been successful; indeed, John was, next to Malachi, the best shot of the party. It was, therefore, very annoying to Percival that he should always be detained at home doing all the drudgery of the house, such as feeding the pigs, cleaning knives, and other menial work, while his younger brother was doing the duty of a man. To Percival's repeated entreaties, objections were constantly raised by his mother: they could not spare him, he was not accustomed to walk in snow-shoes. Mr Campbell observed that Percival became dissatisfied and unhappy, and Alfred took his part and pleaded for him. Alfred observed very truly, that the Strawberry could occasionally do Percival's work, and that if it could be avoided, he should not be cooped up at home in the way that he was; and, Mr. Campbell agreeing with Alfred, Mrs. Campbell very reluctantly gave her consent to his occasionally going out.",hunting party say continue necessary supply many mouth grow residence anxious permit join former winter natural see young brother go return successful good shot party annoying detain home do drudgery house such feed pig clean knife other menial work young brother do duty man repeat entreaty objection raise mother spare accustom walk snow shoe observe become dissatisfied unhappy take part plead observe do work avoid coop home way agree give consent go 
33,"""Why, aunt, have you such an objection to Percival going out with the hunters?"" said Mary. ""It must be very trying to him to be always detained at home.""",aunt objection go hunter say try detain home 
34,"""I feel the truth of what you say, my dear Mary,"" said Mrs. Campbell, ""and I assure you it is not out of selfishness, or because we shall have more work to do, that I wish him to remain with us; but I have an instinctive dread that some accident will happen to him, which I can not overcome, and there is no arguing with a mother's fears and a mother's love.""",feel truth say dear say assure selfishness have more work do wish remain have instinctive dread accident happen overcome be argue mother fear mother love 
35,"""You were quite as uneasy, my dear aunt, when John first went out; you were continually in alarm about him, but now you are perfectly at ease,"" replied Emma.",uneasy dear aunt go alarm ease reply 
36,"""Very true,"" said Mrs. Campbell; ""it is, perhaps, a weakness on my part which I ought to get over; but we are all liable to such feelings. I trust in God there is no real cause for apprehension, and that my reluctance is a mere weakness and folly. But I see the poor boy has long pined at being kept at home; for nothing is more irksome to a high-couraged and spirited boy as he is. I have, therefore, given my consent, because I think it is my duty; still the feeling remains, so let us say no more about it, my dear girls, for the subject is painful to me.""",true say weakness part get liable such feeling trust be real cause apprehension reluctance mere weakness folly see poor boy pine keep home irksome high couraged spirit boy give consent think duty feeling remain let say more dear girl subject painful 
37,"""My dear aunt, did you not say that you would talk to Strawberry on the subject of religion, and try if you could not persuade her to become a Christian? She is very serious at prayers, I observe; and appears, now that she understands English, to be very attentive to what is said.""",dear aunt say talk subject religion try persuade become serious prayer observe appear understand attentive say 
38,"""Yes, my dear Emma, it is my intention so to do very soon, but I do not like to be in too great a hurry. A mere conforming to the usages of our religion would be of little avail, and I fear that too many of our good missionaries, in their anxiety to make converts, do not sufficiently consider this point. Religion must proceed from conviction, and be seated in the heart; the heart, indeed, must be changed, not mere outward forms attended to.""",dear intention do like great hurry mere conforming usage religion little avail fear many good missionary anxiety make convert consider point religion proceed conviction seat heart heart change mere outward form attend 
39,"""What is the religion of the Indians, my dear aunt?"" said Mary.",religion dear aunt say 
40,"""One which makes conversion the more difficult. It is in many respects so near what is right, that Indians do not easily perceive the necessity of change. They believe in one God, the fountain of all good; they believe in a future state and in future rewards and punishments. You perceive they have the same foundation as we have, although they know not Christ, and, having very incomplete notions of duty, have a very insufficient sense of their manifold transgressions and offenses in God's sight, and consequently have no idea of the necessity of a mediator. Now it is, perhaps, easier to convince those who are entirely wrong, such as worship idols and false gods, than those who approach so nearly to the truth. But I have had many hours of reflection upon the proper course to pursue, and I do intend to have some conversation with her on the subject in a very short time. I have delayed because I consider it absolutely necessary that she should be perfectly aware of what I say, before I try to alter her belief. Now the Indian language, although quite sufficient for Indian wants, is poor, and has not the same copiousness as ours, because they do not require the words to explain what we term abstract ideas. It is, therefore, impossible to explain the mysteries of our holy religion to one who does not well understand our language. I think, however, that the Strawberry now begins to comprehend sufficiently for me to make the first attempt. I say first attempt, because I have no idea of making a convert in a week, or a month, or even in six months. All I can do is to exert my best abilities, and then trust to God, who, in His own good time, will enlighten her mind to receive His truth.""",make conversion difficult many respect right perceive necessity change believe fountain good believe future state future reward punishment perceive have same foundation have know have incomplete notion duty have insufficient sense manifold transgression offense sight have idea necessity mediator easy convince wrong such worship idol false god approach truth have many hour reflection proper course pursue intend have conversation subject short time delay consider necessary aware say try alter belief indian language sufficient want poor have same copiousness require word explain term abstract idea impossible explain mystery holy religion understand language think begin comprehend make first attempt say first attempt have idea make convert week month month do exert good ability trust own good time enlighten mind receive truth 
41,"The next day the hunting party went out, and Percival, to his great delight, was permitted to accompany it. As they had a long way to go, for they had selected the hunting ground, they set off early in the morning, before daylight, Mr. Campbell having particularly requested that they would not return home late.",next day hunting party go great delight permit accompany have long way go select hunting ground set morning daylight request return
