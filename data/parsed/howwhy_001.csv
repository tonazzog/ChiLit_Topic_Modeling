2," My dear boys,--When I was your age, there were no such children's books as there are now.  Those which we had were few and dull, and the pictures in them ugly and mean: while you have your choice of books without number, clear, amusing, and pretty, as well as really instructive, on subjects which were only talked of fifty years ago by a few learned men, and very little understood even by them.  So if mere reading of books would make wise men, you ought to grow up much wiser than us old fellows. But mere reading of wise books will not make you wise men: you must use for yourselves the tools with which books are made wise; and that is--your eyes, and ears, and common sense.",dear boy age be such child book be have few dull picture ugly mean have choice book number clear amusing instructive subject talk year few learn man little understand mere reading book make wise man grow wise old fellow mere reading wise book make wise man use tool book make wise eye ear common sense 
3,"Now, among those very stupid old-fashioned boys' books was one which taught me that; and therefore I am more grateful to it than if it had been as full of wonderful pictures as all the natural history books you ever saw.  Its name was _Evenings at Home_; and in it was a story called ""Eyes and no Eyes;"" a regular old-fashioned, prim, sententious story; and it began thus:--",stupid old fashioned boys' book teach grateful full wonderful picture natural history book see name eevening story call eye regular old fashioned prim sententious story begin 
4,"""Well, Robert, where have you been walking this afternoon?"" said Mr. Andrews to one of his pupils at the close of a holiday.",walk afternoon say pupil close holiday 
5,"Oh--Robert had been to Broom Heath, and round by Camp Mount, and home through the meadows.  But it was very dull.  He hardly saw a single person.  He had much rather have gone by the turnpike-road.",home meadow dull see single person go turnpike road 
6,"Presently in comes Master William, the other pupil, dressed, I suppose, as wretched boys used to be dressed forty years ago, in a frill collar, and skeleton monkey-jacket, and tight trousers buttoned over it, and hardly coming down to his ancles; and low shoes, which always came off in sticky ground; and terribly dirty and wet he is: but he never (he says) had such a pleasant walk in his life; and he has brought home his handkerchief (for boys had no pockets in those days much bigger than key- holes) full of curiosities.",come other pupil dress suppose wretch boy use dress year frill collar skeleton monkey jacket tight trousers button come ancle low shoe come sticky ground dirty wet say have pleasant walk life bring handkerchief boy have pocket day big key hole full curiosity 
7,"He has got a piece of mistletoe, wants to know what it is; and he has seen a woodpecker, and a wheat-ear, and gathered strange flowers on the heath; and hunted a peewit because he thought its wing was broken, till of course it led him into a bog, and very wet he got.  But he did not mind it, because he fell in with an old man cutting turf, who told him all about turf-cutting, and gave him a dead adder.  And then he went up a hill, and saw a grand prospect; and wanted to go again, and make out the geography of the country from Cary's old county maps, which were the only maps in those days.  And then, because the hill was called Camp Mount, he looked for a Roman camp, and found one; and then he went down to the river, saw twenty things more; and so on, and so on, till he had brought home curiosities enough, and thoughts enough, to last him a week.",get piece mistletoe want know see woodpecker wheat ear gather strange flower heath hunt peewit think wing break course lead bog wet get mind fall old man cut turf tell turf cutting give dead adder go hill see grand prospect want go make geography country old county map only map day hill call look roman camp find go river see thing bring home curiosity thought last week 
8,"Whereon Mr. Andrews, who seems to have been a very sensible old gentleman, tells him all about his curiosities: and then it comes out--if you will believe it--that Master William has been over the very same ground as Master Robert, who saw nothing at all.",seem sensible old gentleman tell curiosity come believe very same ground see

10,"""So it is.  One man walks through the world with his eyes open, another with his eyes shut; and upon this difference depends all the superiority of knowledge which one man acquires over another.  I have known sailors who had been in all the quarters of the world, and could tell you nothing but the signs of the tippling-houses, and the price and quality of the liquor.  On the other hand, Franklin could not cross the Channel without making observations useful to mankind.  While many a vacant thoughtless youth is whirled through Europe without gaining a single idea worth crossing the street for, the observing eye and inquiring mind find matter of improvement and delight in every ramble.  You, then, William, continue to use your eyes.  And you, Robert, learn that eyes were given to you to use.""",man walk world eye open eye shut difference depend superiority knowledge man acquire know sailor quarter world tell sign tippling house price quality liquor other hand cross make observation useful mankind many vacant thoughtless youth whirl gain single idea worth cross street observe eye inquire mind find matter improvement delight ramble continue use eye learn eye give use 
11,"So said Mr. Andrews: and so I say, dear boys--and so says he who has the charge of you--to you.  Therefore I beg all good boys among you to think over this story, and settle in their own minds whether they will be eyes or no eyes; whether they will, as they grow up, look and see for themselves what happens: or whether they will let other people look for them, or pretend to look; and dupe them, and lead them about--the blind leading the blind, till both fall into the ditch.",say say dear boy say have charge beg good boy think story settle own mind eye eye grow look see happen let other person look pretend look dupe lead blind lead blind fall ditch 
12,"I say ""good boys;"" not merely clever boys, or prudent boys: because using your eyes, or not using them, is a question of doing Right or doing Wrong.  God has given you eyes; it is your duty to God to use them.  If your parents tried to teach you your lessons in the most agreeable way, by beautiful picture-books, would it not be ungracious, ungrateful, and altogether naughty and wrong, to shut your eyes to those pictures, and refuse to learn?  And is it not altogether naughty and wrong to refuse to learn from your Father in Heaven, the Great God who made all things, when he offers to teach you all day long by the most beautiful and most wonderful of all picture-books, which is simply all things which you can see, hear, and touch, from the sun and stars above your head to the mosses and insects at your feet?  It is your duty to learn His lessons: and it is your interest.  God's Book, which is the Universe, and the reading of God's Book, which is Science, can do you nothing but good, and teach you nothing but truth and wisdom.  God did not put this wondrous world about your young souls to tempt or to mislead them.  If you ask Him for a fish, he will not give you a serpent.  If you ask Him for bread, He will not give you a stone.",say good boy clever boy prudent boy use eye use question do right do give eye duty use parent try teach lesson agreeable way beautiful picture book ungracious ungrateful naughty wrong shut eye picture refuse learn naughty wrong refuse learn father great make thing offer teach day beautiful wonderful picture book thing see hear touch sun star head mosse insect foot duty learn lesson interest reading do good teach truth wisdom put wondrous world young soul temp mislead ask fish give serpent ask bread give stone 
13,"So use your eyes and your intellect, your senses and your brains, and learn what God is trying to teach you continually by them.  I do not mean that you must stop there, and learn nothing more.  Anything but that. There are things which neither your senses nor your brains can tell you; and they are not only more glorious, but actually more true and more real than any things which you can see or touch.  But you must begin at the beginning in order to end at the end, and sow the seed if you wish to gather the fruit.  God has ordained that you, and every child which comes into the world, should begin by learning something of the world about him by his senses and his brain; and the better you learn what they can teach you, the more fit you will be to learn what they cannot teach you.  The more you try now to understand _things_, the more you will be able hereafter to understand men, and That which is above men.  You began to find out that truly Divine mystery, that you had a mother on earth, simply by lying soft and warm upon her bosom; and so (as Our Lord told the Jews of old) it is by watching the common natural things around you, and considering the lilies of the field, how they grow, that you will begin at least to learn that far Diviner mystery, that you have a Father in Heaven.  And so you will be delivered (if you will) out of the tyranny of darkness, and distrust, and fear, into God's free kingdom of light, and faith, and love; and will be safe from the venom of that tree which is more deadly than the fabled upas of the East.  Who planted that tree I know not, it was planted so long ago: but surely it is none of God's planting, neither of the Son of God: yet it grows in all lands and in all climes, and sends its hidden suckers far and wide, even (unless we be watchful) into your hearts and mine.  And its name is the Tree of Unreason, whose roots are conceit and ignorance, and its juices folly and death.  It drops its venom into the finest brains; and makes them call sense, nonsense; and nonsense, sense; fact, fiction; and fiction, fact. It drops its venom into the tenderest hearts, alas! and makes them call wrong, right; and right, wrong; love, cruelty; and cruelty, love.  Some say that the axe is laid to the root of it just now, and that it is already tottering to its fall: while others say that it is growing stronger than ever, and ready to spread its upas-shade over the whole earth.  For my part, I know not, save that all shall be as God wills.  The tree has been cut down already again and again; and yet has always thrown out fresh shoots and dropped fresh poison from its boughs.  But this at least I know: that any little child, who will use the faculties God has given him, may find an antidote to all its poison in the meanest herb beneath his feet.",use eye intellect sense brain learn try teach mean stop learn more be thing sense brain tell glorious true real thing see touch begin beginning order end end sow seed wish gather fruit ordain child come world begin learn world sense brain good learn teach fit learn teach more try understand more able understand man man begin find divine mystery have mother earth lie soft warm bosom tell old watch common natural thing consider lilie field grow begin least learn diviner mystery have father deliver tyranny darkness distrust fear free kingdom light faith love safe venom tree deadly fabled upa plant tree know plant planting son grow land clime send hidden sucker wide watchful heart name root conceit ignorance juice folly death drop venom fine brain make call sense nonsense nonsense sense fact fiction fiction fact drop venom tenderest heart make call wrong right right wrong love cruelty cruelty love say axe lay root totter fall other say grow strong ready spread upa shade whole earth part know save will tree cut throw fresh shoot drop fresh poison bough least know little child use faculty give find antidote poison mean herb foot 
14,"There, you do not understand me, my boys; and the best prayer I can offer for you is, perhaps, that you should never need to understand me: but if that sore need should come, and that poison should begin to spread its mist over your brains and hearts, then you will be proof against it; just in proportion as you have used the eyes and the common sense which God has given you, and have considered the lilies of the field, how they grow.",understand boy good prayer offer need understand sore need come poison begin spread mist brain heart proof proportion use eye common sense give consider lilie field grow
