1,CHAPTER 12. IN THE CHAPEL.,chapter 
2,The bright light from a full noontide sun was shining in coloured bars through the richly-painted windows of the little chapel when Mrs Willis sought Cecil Temple there.,bright light full noontide sun shine coloured bar paint window little chapel seek 
3,"Cecil's face was in many ways a remarkable one.  Her soft brown eyes were generally filled with a steadfast and kindly ray.  Gentleness was her special prerogative, but there was nothing weak about her--hers was the gentleness of a strong and pure and noble soul.  To know Cecil was to love her.  She was a motherless girl, and the only child of a most indulgent father.  Colonel Temple was now in India, and Cecil was to finish her education under Mrs Willis's care, and then, if necessary, to join her father.",face many way remarkable one soft brown eye fill steadfast kindly ray gentleness special prerogative be weak gentleness strong pure noble soul know love motherless girl only child indulgent father finish education care necessary join father 
4,"Mrs Willis had always taken a special interest in this girl.  She admired her for her great moral worth.  Cecil was not particularly clever, but she was so studious, so painstaking, that she always kept a high place in class.  She was without doubt a religious girl, but there was nothing of the prig about her.  She was not, however, ashamed of her religion, and, if the fitting occasion arose, she was fearless in expressing her opinion.",take special interest girl admire great moral worth clever studious painstaking keep high place class doubt religious girl be prig ashamed religion fitting occasion arise fearless express opinion 
5,"Mrs Willis used to call Cecil her ""little standard-bearer,"" and she relied greatly on her influence over the third-class girls.  Mrs Willis considered the third-class, perhaps, the most important in the school. She was often heard to say--",use call little standard bearer rely influence third class girl consider third class important school hear say 
6,"""The girls who fill this class have come to a turning-point--they have come to the age when resolves may be made for life, and kept.  The good third-class girl is very unlikely to degenerate as she passes through the second and first classes.  On the other hand, there is very little hope that the idle or mischievous third-class girl will mend her ways as she goes higher in the school.""",girl fill class come turning point come age resolve make life keep good third class girl unlikely degenerate pass second first class other hand be little hope idle mischievous third class girl mend way go high school 
7,"Mrs Willis's steps were very slow, and her thoughts extremely painful, as she entered the chapel to-day.  Had any one else offered her defiance she would have known how to deal with the culprit, but Cecil would never have acted as she did without the strongest motive, and Mrs Willis felt more sorrowful than angry as she sat down by the side of her favourite pupil.",step slow thought painful enter chapel day have one else offer defiance know deal culprit act do strong motive feel sorrowful angry sit side favourite pupil 
8,"""I have kept you waiting longer than I intended, my dear,"" she said.  ""I was unexpectedly interrupted, and I am sorry; but you have had more time to think, Cecil.""",keep wait intend dear say interrupt sorry have more time think 
9,"""Yes, I have thought,"" answered Cecil, in a very low tone.",think answer low tone 
10,"""And, perhaps,"" continued her governess, ""in this quiet and beautiful and sacred place, my dear pupil has also prayed?""",continue governess quiet beautiful sacred place dear pupil pray 
11,"""I have prayed,"" said Cecil.",pray say 
12,"""Then you have been guided, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis in a tone of relief.  ""We do not come to God in our distress without being shown the right way.  Your doubts have been removed, Cecil; you can now speak fully to me; can you not, dear?""",guide say tone relief come distress show right way doubt remove speak dear 
13,"""I have asked God to tell me what is right,"" said Cecil.  ""I don't pretend to know.  I am very much puzzled.  It seems to me that more good would be done if I concealed what you asked me to confess in the school-room.  My own feeling is that I ought not to tell you.  I know this is great disobedience, and I am quite willing to receive any punishment you think right to give me.  Yes, I think I am quite willing to receive _any_ punishment.""",ask tell right say pretend know puzzled seem more good do conceal ask confess school room own feeling tell know great disobedience willing receive punishment think right give think willing receive punishment 
14,Mrs Willis put her hand on Cecil's shoulder.,put hand shoulder 
15,"""Ordinary punishments are not likely to affect you, Cecil,"" she said; ""on you I have no idea of inflicting extra lessons, or depriving you of half-holidays, or even taking away your drawing-room.  But there is something else you must lose, and that I know will touch you deeply--I must remove from you my confidence.""",ordinary punishment likely affect say have idea inflict extra lesson deprive half holiday take draw room be else lose know touch remove confidence 
16,Cecil's face grew very pale.,face grow pale 
17,"""And your love, too?"" she said, looking up with imploring eyes: ""oh, surely not your love as well?""",love say look implor eye love 
18,"""I ask you frankly, Cecil,"" replied Mrs Willis, ""can perfect love exist without perfect confidence?  I would not willingly deprive you of my love, but of necessity the love I have hitherto felt for you must be altered--in short, the old love which enabled me to rest on you and trust you, will cease.""",ask reply perfect love exist perfect confidence deprive love necessity love feel alter short old love enable rest trust cease 
19,Cecil covered her face with her hands.,cover face hand 
20,"""This punishment is very cruel,"" she said.  ""You are right; it reaches down to my very heart.  But,"" she added, looking up with a strong and sweet light in her face, ""I will try and bear it, and some day you will understand.""",punishment cruel say right reach very heart add look strong sweet light face try bear day understand 
21,"""Listen, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you have just told me you have prayed to God, and have asked Him to show you the right path.  Now, my dear, suppose we kneel together, and both of us ask Him to show us the way out of this difficult matter.  I want to be guided to use the right words with you, Cecil.  You want to be guided to receive the instruction which I, as your teacher and mother-friend, would give you.""",listen say tell pray ask show right path dear suppose kneel ask show way difficult matter want guide use right word want guide receive instruction teacher mother friend give 
22,"Cecil and Mrs Willis both knelt down, and the head-mistress said a few words in a voice of great earnestness and entreaty; then they resumed their seats.",knolt head mistress say few word voice great earnestness entreaty resume seat 
23,"""Now, Cecil,"" said Mrs Willis, ""you must remember in listening to me that I am speaking to you as I believe God wishes me to.  If I can convince you that you are doing wrong in concealing what you know from me, will you act as I wish in the matter?""",say remember listen speak believe wish convince do wrong conceal know act wish matter 
24,"""I long to be convinced,"" said Cecil, in a low tone.",convinced say low tone 
25,"""That is right, my dear; I can now speak to you with perfect freedom. My words you will remember, Cecil, are now, I firmly believe, directed by God; they are also the result of a large experience.  I have trained many girls.  I have watched the phases of thought in many young minds. Cecil, look at me.  I can read you like a book.""",right dear speak perfect freedom word remember believe direct result large experience train many girl watch phase thought many young mind look read book 
26,Cecil looked up expectantly.,look 
27,"""Your motive for this concealment is as clear as the daylight, Cecil. You are keeping back what you know because you want to shield some one. Am I not right, my dear?""  The colour flooded Cecil's pale face.  She bent her head in silent assent, but her eyes were too full of tears, and her lips trembled too much to allow her to speak.",motive concealment clear daylight keep know want shield one right dear colour flood pale face bend head silent assent eye full tear lip tremble much allow speak 
28,"""The girl you want to defend,"" continued Mrs Willis, in that clear patient voice of hers, ""is one whom you and I both love; is one for whom we both have prayed; is one for whom we would both gladly sacrifice ourselves if necessary--her name is--""",girl want defend continue clear patient voice love pray sacrifice necessary name 
29,"""Oh, don't,"" said Cecil imploringly--""don't say her name; you have no right to suspect her.""",say say name have right suspect

31,Cecil began to cry.,begin cry 
32,"""I know it,"" continued Mrs Willis.  ""Now, Cecil, we will suppose, terrible as this suspicion is, fearfully as it pains us both, that Annie Forest _is_ guilty.  We must suppose for the sake of my argument that this is the case.  Do you not know, my dear Cecil, that you are doing the falsest, cruellest thing by dear Annie in trying to hide her sin from me?  Suppose, just for the sake of our argument, that this cowardly conduct on Annie's part was never found out by me; what effect would it have on Annie herself?""",know continue suppose terrible suspicion pain guilty suppose sake argument case know dear do falsest cruellest thing dear try hide sin suppose sake argument cowardly conduct part find effect have 
33,"""It would save her in the eyes of the school,"" said Cecil.",save eye school say 
34,"""Just so, but God would know the truth.  Her next downfall would be deeper.  In short, Cecil, under the idea of friendship you would have done the cruellest thing in all the world for your friend.""",know truth next downfall deep short idea friendship do cruellest thing world friend 
35,Cecil was quite silent.,silent 
36,"""This is one way to look at it,"" continued Mrs Willis, ""but there are many other points from which this case ought to be viewed.  You owe much to Annie, but not all--you have a duty to perform to your other school-fellows.  You have a duty to perform to me.  If you possess a clue which will enable me to convict Annie Forest of her sin, in common justice you have no right to withhold it.  Remember that while she goes about free and unsuspected some other girl is under the ban--some other girl is watched and feared.  You fail in your duty to your school-fellows when you keep back your knowledge, Cecil.  When you refuse to trust me, you fail in your duty to your mistress; for I cannot stamp out this evil and wicked thing from our midst unless I know all. When you conceal your knowledge, you ruin the character of the girl you seek to shield.  When you conceal your knowledge, you go against God's express wish.  There--I have spoken to you as He directed me to speak.""",way look continue be many other point case view owe much have duty perform other school fellow have duty perform possess clue enable convict sin common justice have right withhold remember go free unsuspected other girl ban other girl watch fear fail duty school fellow keep knowledge refuse trust fail duty mistress stamp evil wicked thing midst know conceal knowledge ruin character girl seek shield conceal knowledge go express wish speak direct speak 
37,Cecil suddenly sprang to her feet.,spring foot 
38,"""I never thought of all these things,"" she said.  ""You are right, but it is very hard, and mine is only a suspicion.  Oh, do be tender to her, and--forgive me--may I go away now?""",think thing say right hard suspicion tender forgive go
