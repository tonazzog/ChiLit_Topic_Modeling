1,CHAPTER 47. RESCUED.,rescued 
2,"The girl, the child, and the dog found themselves in a comparatively strange country--Annie had completely lost her bearings.  She looked around her for some sign of the gipsies' encampment; but whether she had really gone a greater distance than she imagined in those underground vaults, or whether the tents were hidden in some hollow of the ground, she did not know; she was only conscious that she was in a strange country, that Nan was clinging to her and crying for her breakfast, and that Tiger was sniffing the air anxiously.  Annie guessed that Tiger could take them back to the camp, but this was by no means her wish. When she emerged out of the underground passage she was conscious for the first time of a strange and unknown experience.  Absolute terror seized the brave child: she trembled from head to foot, her head ached violently, and the ground on which she stood seemed to reel, and the sky to turn round.  She sat down for a moment on the green grass.  What ailed her? where was she? how could she get home?  Nan's little piteous wail, ""Me want my bekfas', me want my nursie, me want Hetty,"" almost irritated her.",girl child dog find strange country lose bearing look sign gipsie encampment go great distance imagine underground vault tent hide hollow ground know conscious strange country cling cry breakfast sniff air guess take camp mean wish emerge underground passage conscious first time strange unknown experience absolute terror seize brave child tremble head foot head ach ground stand seem reel sky turn sit moment green grass ail get little piteous wail want bekfas want nursie want irritate
