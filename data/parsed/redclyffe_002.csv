It had an air of great snugness, with its large folding-screen, covered with prints and caricatures of ancient date, its book-shelves, its tables, its peculiarly easy arm-chairs, the great invalid sofa, and the grate, which always lighted up better than any other in the house.",pleasantest room dress room large bay windowed draw room have little dress room name toilet table black gold japann glass shape box match room open side other sort stair parlour teach cast account speak servant write note find unequal come stair have air great snugness large fold screen cover print caricature ancient date book shelf table easy arm chair great invalid sofa grate light good other house 
4,"In the bright glow of the fire, with the shutters closed and curtains drawn, lay Charles on his couch, one Monday evening, in a gorgeous dressing-gown of a Chinese pattern, all over pagodas, while little Charlotte sat opposite to him, curled up on a footstool. He was not always very civil to Charlotte; she sometimes came into collision with him, for she, too, was a pet, and had a will of her own, and at other times she could bore him; but just now they had a common interest, and he was gracious.",bright glow fire shutter close curtain draw lay couch evening gorgeous dress gown chinese pattern pagoda little sit curl footstool civil come collision pet have will own other time bear have common interest gracious

He left three children, Margaret and Fanny, twenty-five and twenty-three years of age, and Philip, just seventeen. The boy was at the head of his school, highly distinguished for application and good conduct; he had attained every honour there open to him, won golden opinions from all concerned with him, and made proof of talents which could not have failed to raise him to the highest university distinctions. He was absent from home at the time of his father’s death, which took place after so short an illness, that there had been no time to summon him back to Stylehurst. Very little property was left to be divided among the three; and as soon as Philip perceived how small was the provision for his sisters, he gave up his hopes of university honours, and obtained a commission in the army.",read summon tea find conversation go history seem inform son brother admirable superior man dead year leave child year age boy head school distinguish application good conduct attain honour open win golden opinion concerned make proof talent fail raise high university distinction absent home time father death take place short illness be time summon little property leave divide perceive small provision sister give hope university honour obtain commission army
