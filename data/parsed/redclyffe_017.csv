20,"The universal feeling was that something was amiss, and mamma was in the secret. Amy looked wistfully at her, but Mrs. Edmonstone only gazed at the window, and so they continued for some minutes, while an uninteresting exchange of question and answer was kept up between her and her nephew until at length the dressing-bell rang, and cleared the room. Mrs. Edmonstone lingered till her son and daughters were gone, and said,--",universal feeling amiss mamma secret look gaze window continue minute uninteresting exchange question answer keep nephew length dress bell ring clear room linger son daughter gone say

I cannot guess what proofs Philip may think he has, of what I never did, and, therefore, I cannot refute them otherwise than by declaring that I never gamed in my life. Tell me what they are, and I will answer them. As to a full confession, I could of course tell you of much in which I have done wrongly, though not in the way which he supposes. On that head, I have nothing to confess. I am sorry I am prevented from satisfying you about the £1OOO, but I am bound in honour not to mention the purpose for which I wanted it. I am sure you could never believe I could have said what I did to Mrs. Edmonstone if I had begun on a course which I detest from the bottom of my heart.

39," Not a little surprised was Philip to find that he was known to be Guy’s accuser; but the conclusion revealed that his style had betrayed him, and that Mr. Edmonstone had finished with some mention of him, and he resolved that henceforth he would never leave a letter of his own dictation till he had seen it signed and sealed.",little surprise find know accuser conclusion reveal style betray finish mention resolve henceforth leave letter own dictation see sign seal

49,"‘There are different ways of understanding such a denial as this,’ said Philip. ‘See, he says not in the way in which I suppose.’ He held up his hand authoritatively, as his aunt was about to interpose. ‘It was against gaming that his vow was made.

55,"Mrs. Edmonstone was grieved to see him so hurt at this. It could not have been helped, and if all had been smooth, he never would have thought of it again; but it served to keep up his dignity in his own eyes, and, as he fancied, to defend him from Philip’s censure, and he therefore made the most of it, which so pained her that she did not venture to continue her championship of Guy.",grieve see hurt help smooth think serve keep dignity own eye fancy defend censure make most pain venture continue championship

And I will try not to seem cross to Philip.’",say learn bear say fit thinking unhappy say know mean uneasy bear say glad try seem cross 
73,"Mr. Edmonstone was fidgety and ill at ease, found fault with the dinner, and was pettish with his wife. Mrs. Edmonstone set Philip off upon politics, which lasted till the ladies could escape into the drawing-room. In another minute Philip brought in Charles, set him down, and departed. Amy, who was standing by the window, resting her forehead against the glass, and gazing into the darkness, turned round hastily, and left the room, but in passing her brother, she put her hand into his, and received a kind pressure. Her mother followed her, and the other three all began to wonder. Charles said he had regularly been turned out of the dining-room by Philip, who announced that he wanted to speak to his uncle, and carried him off.",fidgety ill ease find fault dinner pettish wife set politics last lady escape draw room minute bring set depart stand window rest forehead glass gaze darkness turn leave room pass brother put hand receive kind pressure mother follow other begin wonder say turn dining room announce want speak uncle carry 
74,"They conjectured, and were indignant at each other’s conjectures, till their mother returned, and gave them as much information as she could; but this only made them very anxious. Charles was certain that Mrs. Henley had laid a cockatrice egg, and Philip was hatching it; and Laura could not trust herself to defend Philip, lest she should do it too vehemently. They could all agree in desire to know the truth, in hope that Guy was not culpable, and, above all, in feeling for Amy; but by tacit consent they were silent on the three shades of opinion in their minds. Laura was confident that Philip was acting for the best; Mrs. Edmonstone thought he might be mistaken in his premises, but desirous of Guy’s real good; and Charles, though sure he would allege nothing which he did not believe to be true, also thought him ready to draw the worst conclusions from small grounds, and to take pleasure in driving Mr. Edmonstone to the most rigorous measures.",conjecture indignant other conjecture mother return give much information make anxious certain lay cockatrice egg hatch trust defend do agree desire know truth hope guy culpable feeling tacit consent silent shade opinion mind confident act good think mistaken premise desirous real good sure allege believe true think ready draw bad conclusion small grounds take pleasure drive rigorous measure 
75,"Philip, meanwhile, was trying to practise great moderation and forbearance, not bringing forward at first what was most likely to incense Mr. Edmonstone, and without appearance of animosity in his cool, guarded speech. There was no design in this, he meant only to be just; yet anything less cool would have had far less effect.",try practise great moderation forbearance bring first likely incense appearance animosity cool guard speech be design mean cool have less effect 
76,"When he shut the dining-room door, he found his uncle wavering, touched by the sight of his little Amy, returning to his first favourable view of Guy’s letter, ready to overlook everything, accept the justification, and receive his ward on the same footing as before, though he was at the same time ashamed that Philip should see him relent, and desirous of keeping up his character for firmness, little guessing how his nephew felt his power over him, and knew that he could wield him at will.",shut dining room door find uncle waver touch sight little return first favourable view letter ready overlook accept justification receive ward same footing same time ashamed see relent desirous keep character firmness little guess nephew feel power know wield will 
77,"Perceiving and pitying his feebleness, and sincerely believing strong measures the only rescue for Amy, the only hope for Guy, Philip found himself obliged to work on him by the production of another letter from his sister. He would rather, if possible, have kept this back, so much did his honourable feeling recoil from what had the air of slander and mischief-making; but he regarded firmness on his uncle’s part as the only chance for Guy or for his cousin, and was resolved not to let him swerve from strict justice.",perceive pity feebleness believe strong measure only rescue only hope find oblige work production letter sister possible keep back do honourable feeling recoil have air slander mischief making regard firmness uncle part only chance cousin resolve let swerve strict justice 
78,"Mrs. Henley had written immediately after Guy’s outburst in her house, and, taking it for granted that her brother would receive a challenge, she wrote in the utmost alarm, urging him to remember how precious he was to her, and not to depart from his own principles.",write guy outburst house take grant brother receive challenge write utmost alarm urge remember precious depart own principle 
79,"‘You would not be so mad as to fight him, eh?’ said Mr. Edmonstone, anxiously. ‘You know better--besides, for poor Amy’s sake.’",mad fight say know good poor sake 
80,"‘For the sake of right,’ replied Philip, ‘no. I have reassured my sister. I have told her that, let the boy do what he will, he shall never make me guilty of his death.’",sake right reply reassure sister tell let boy do make guilty death 
81,"‘You have heard from him, then?’",hear 
82,"‘No; I suppose a night’s reflection convinced him that he had no rational grounds for violent proceedings, and he had sense enough not to expose himself to such an answer as I should have given. What caused his wrath to be directed towards me especially, I cannot tell, nor can my sister,’ said Philip, looking full at his uncle; ‘but I seem to have come in for a full share of it.’",suppose night reflection convince have rational grounds violent proceedings have sense expose answer give cause wrath direct tell sister say look full uncle seem come full share 
83,"He proceeded to read the description of Guy’s passion, and the expressions he had used. Violent as it had been, it did not lose in Mrs. Henley’s colouring; and what made the effect worse was that she had omitted to say she had overheard his language, so that it appeared as if he had been unrestrained even by gentlemanly feeling, and had thus spoken of her brother and uncle in her presence.",proceed read description passion expression use violent lose colouring make effect bad omit say overhear language appear unrestrained gentlemanly feeling speak brother uncle presence 
84,"Mr. Edmonstone was resentful now, really displeased, and wounded to the quick. The point on which he was especially sensitive was his reputation for sense and judgment; and that Guy, who had shown him so much respect and affection, whom he had treated with invariable kindness, and received into his family like a son, that he should thus speak of him shocked him extremely. He was too much overcome even to break out into exclamations at first, he only drank off his glass of wine hastily, and said, ‘I would never have thought it!’",resentful displeased wound quick point sensitive reputation sense judgment show much respect affection treat invariable kindness receive family son speak shock overcome break exclamation drink glass wine say think 
85,"With these words, all desire for forbearance and toleration departed. If Guy could speak thus of him, he was ready to believe any accusation, to think him deceitful from the first, to say he had been trifling with Amy, to imagine him a confirmed reprobate, and cast him off entirely. Philip had some difficulty to restrain him from being too violent; and to keep him to the matter in hand, he defended Guy from the exaggerations of his imagination in a manner which appeared highly noble, considering how Guy had spoken of him. Before they parted that night, another letter had been written, which stood thus,--",word desire forbearance toleration depart guy speak ready believe accusation think deceitful first say trifl imagine confirm reprobate cast have difficulty restrain violent keep matter hand defend guy exaggeration imagination manner appear noble consider speak part night letter write stand 
86," ‘DEAR SIR GUY,--Since you refuse the confidence which I have a right to demand, since you elude the explanation I asked, and indulge yourself in speaking in disrespectful terms of me and my family, I have every reason to suppose that you have no desire to continue on the same footing as heretofore at Hollywell. As your guardian, I repeat that I consider myself bound to keep a vigilant watch over your conduct, and, if possible, to recover you from the unhappy course in which you have involved yourself: but all other intercourse between you and this family must cease. ‘Your horse shall be sent to Redclyffe to-morrow.",dear sir guy refuse confidence have right demand elude explanation ask indulge speak disrespectful term family have reason suppose have desire continue same footing heretofore guardian repeat consider bound keep vigilant watch conduct possible recover unhappy course involve other intercourse family cease horse send

88," This letter was more harsh than Philip wished; but Mr. Edmonstone would hardly be prevailed on to consent to enter on no further reproaches. He insisted on banishing Deloraine, as well as on the mention of Guy’s disrespect, both against his nephew’s opinion; but it was necessary to let him have his own way on these points, and Philip thought himself fortunate in getting a letter written which was in any degree rational and moderate.",letter harsh wish prevail consent enter further reproache insist banish mention disrespect nephew opinion necessary let have own way point think fortunate get letter write degree rational moderate 
89,"They had been so busy, and Mr. Edmonstone so excited, that Philip thought it best to accept the offer of tea being sent them in the dining-room, and it was not till nearly midnight that their conference broke up, when Mr. Edmonstone found his wife sitting up by the dressing-room fire, having shut Charles’s door, sorely against his will.",busy excited think good accept offer tea send dining room midnight conference break find wife sit dress room fire shut door will 
90,"‘There,’ began Mr. Edmonstone, ‘you may tell Amy she may give him up, and a lucky escape she has had. But this is what comes of settling matters in my absence.’ So he proceeded with the narration, mixing the facts undistinguishably with his own surmises, and overwhelming his wife with dismay. If a quarter of this was true, defence of Guy was out of the question; and it was still more impossible to wish Amy’s attachment to him to continue; and though much was incredible, it was no time to say so. She could only hope morning would soften her husband’s anger, and make matters explicable.",begin tell give lucky escape have come settle matter absence proceed narration mix fact own surmise overwhelming wife dismay quarter true defence question impossible wish attachment continue much incredible time say hope morning soften husband anger make matter explicable 
91,"Morning failed to bring her comfort. Mr. Edmonstone repeated that Amy must be ordered to give up all thoughts of Guy, and she perceived that the words ascribed to him stood on evidence which could not be doubted. She could believe he might have spoken them in the first shock of an unjust imputation, and she thought he might have been drawn into some scrape to serve a friend; but she could never suppose him capable of all Mr. Edmonstone imagined.",morning fail bring comfort repeat order give thought perceive word ascribe stand evidence doubt believe speak first shock unjust imputation think draw scrape serve friend suppose capable imagine 
92,"The first attempt to plead his cause, however, brought on her an angry reply; for Philip, by a hint, that she never saw a fault in Guy, had put it into his uncle’s head that she would try to lead him, and made him particularly inaccessible to her influence.",first attempt plead cause bring angry reply hint see fault put uncle head try lead make inaccessible influence 
93,"There was no help for it, then; poor little Amy must hear the worst; and it was not long before Mrs. Edmonstone found her waiting in the dressing-room. Between obedience to her husband, her conviction of Guy’s innocence, and her tenderness to her daughter, Mrs. Edmonstone had a hard task, and she could scarcely check her tears as Amy nestled up for her morning kiss.",be help poor little hear bad find wait dress room obedience husband conviction innocence tenderness daughter have hard task check tear nestle morning kiss

102,"Charles loudly protested that the charges were absurd and preposterous, and would be proved so in no time. He would finish dressing instantly, go to speak to his father, and show him the sense of the thing.

Mr. Edmonstone grew angry with him for disregarding the insulting term applied to himself; and Charles, who, though improved in many points, still sometimes showed the effects of early habits of disrespect to his father, answered hastily, that no one could wonder at Guy’s resenting such suspicions; he deserved no blame at all, and would have been a blockhead to bear it tamely.",little epithet apply mind proof sufficient man capable vice say pleasure gall cousin perceive harm do friend cause recall affront father least feel grow angry disregard insulting term apply improve many point show effect early habit disrespect father answer wonder resent such suspicion deserve blame blockhead bear 
119,"This was more than Charles meant, but his temper was fairly roused, and he said much more than was right or judicious, so that his advocacy only injured the cause. He had many representations to make on the injustice of condemning Guy unheard, of not even laying before him the proofs on which the charges were founded, and on the danger of actually driving him into mischief, by shutting the doors of Hollywell against him. ‘If you wanted to make him all you say he is, you are taking the very best means.’",more mean temper rouse say more right judicious advocacy injure cause have many representation make injustice condemn guy unheard lay proof charge found danger drive mischief shut door want make say take good means 
120,"Quite true; but Charles had made his father too angry to pay attention. This stormy discussion continued for nearly two hours, with no effect save inflaming the minds of all parties. At last Mr. Edmonstone was called away; and Charles, rising, declared he should go at that moment, and write to tell Guy that there was one person at least still in his senses.",true make father angry pay attention stormy discussion continue hour effect inflame mind party last call rise declare go moment write tell guy be person least sense

129,"‘Take care what you say!’ exclaimed Charles, flushing with anger, as he threw himself forward, with an impatient movement, trusting to his crutch rather than retain his cousin’s arm; but the crutch slipped, he missed his grasp at the balusters, and would have fallen to the bottom of the flight if Philip had not been close behind. Stretching out his foot, he made a barrier, receiving Charles’s weight against his breast, and then, taking him in his arms, carried him up the rest of the way as easily as if he had been a child. The noise brought Amy out of the dressing-room, much frightened, though she did not speak till Charles was deposited on the sofa, and assured them he was not in the least hurt, but he would hardly thank his cousin for having so dexterously saved him; and Philip, relieved from the fear of his being injured, viewed the adventure as a mere ebullition of ill-temper, and went away.",take care say exclaim flush anger throw impatient movement trust crutch retain cousin arm crutch slip miss grasp baluster fall bottom flight close stretch foot make barrier receive weight breast take arm carry rest way child noise bring dress room frighten speak deposit sofa assure least hurt thank cousin save relieve fear injure view adventure mere ebullition ill temper go

I know if I was good for anything, things would not long be in this state. I should be at St. Mildred’s by this time, at the bottom of the whole story, and Philip would be taught to eat his words in no time, and make as few wry faces as suited his dignity.

She saw Deloraine led out, his chestnut neck glossy in the sun and William prepared for a journey, and the other servants shaking hands, and bidding him good-bye. She saw him ride off, and could hardly help flying back to her brother to exclaim, ‘O Charlie, they have sent Deloraine away!’ while the longing to send one kind greeting became more earnest than ever; but she withstood it, and throwing herself on the bed, exclaimed,--",fresh trial await look own window see lead chestnut neck glossy sun prepare journey other servant shake hand bid good bye see ride help fly brother exclaim send longing send kind greeting become earnest withstood throw bed exclaim

She had one comfort, in the certainty that Guy would bear it nobly. She was happy to find her confidence confirmed by her mother and Charles; and one thing she thought she need not give up, though she might no longer think of him as her lover, she might be his Verena still, whether he knew it or not. It could not be wrong to remember any one in her prayers, and to ask that he might not be led into temptation, but have strength to abide patiently. That helped her to feel that he was in the hands of One to whom the secrets of all hearts are known; and a line of poetry seemed to be whispered in her ears, in his own sweet tones,--",endeavour persuade kind judicious sit own good intention sooth affection family bitter suffering heart unallay fond tender feeling tear thought guy endure pain know father work have comfort certainty bear happy find confidence confirm mother thing think give think lover know wrong remember one prayer ask lead temptation have strength abide help feel hand secret heart know line poetry seem whisper ear own sweet tone

190,"So, after the first day, she went on pretty well. She was indeed silent and grave, and no longer the sunbeam of Hollywell; but she took her share in what was passing, and a common observer would hardly have remarked the submissive melancholy of her manner. Her father was very affectionate, and often called her his jewel of good girls; but he was too much afraid of women’s tears to talk to her about Guy, he left that to her mother: and Mrs. Edmonstone, having seen her submit to her father’s will, was unwilling to say more.",first day go silent grave sunbeam take share pass common observer remark submissive melancholy manner father affectionate call jewel good girl afraid woman tear talk guy leave mother see submit father will unwilling say more 
191,"She doubted whether it was judicious to encourage her in dwelling on Guy; for, even supposing his character clear, they had offended him deeply, and released him from any engagement to her, so that there was nothing to prevent him from forming an attachment elsewhere. Mrs. Edmonstone did not think he would; but it was better to say nothing about him, lest she should not speak prudently, and only keep up the subject in Amy’s mind.",doubt judicious encourage dwelling suppose character clear offend release engagement be prevent form attachment think good say speak keep subject mind 
192,"Charles stormed and wrangled, told Mr. Edmonstone ‘he was breaking his daughter’s heart, that was all;’ and talked of unfairness and injustice, till Mr. Edmonstone vowed it was beyond all bearing, that his own son should call him a tyrant, and accused Guy of destroying all peace in his family.",storm wrangle tell break daughter heart talk unfairness injustice vow bear own son call tyrant accuse destroy peace family 
193,"The replies to the letters came; some thought them satisfactory, and the others wondered that they thought so. Mr. Wellwood gave the highest character of his pupil, and could not imagine how any irregularities could be laid to his charge; but when asked in plain terms how he disposed of his time, could only answer in general, that he had friends and engagements of his own at St. Mildred’s and its neighbourhood, and had been several times at Mrs. Henley’s and at Colonel Harewood’s. The latter place, unfortunately, was the very object of Philip’s suspicions; and thus the letter was anything but an exculpation.",reply letter come think satisfactory other wonder think give high character pupil imagine irregularity lay charge ask plain term dispose time answer general have friend engagement own neighbourhood several time latter place very object suspicion letter exculpation

He again begged for the supposed evidence of his misconduct, declaring he could explain it, whatever it might be, and proceeded to utter deep regrets for his hasty expressions.",guy write fulness heart express gratitude confidence sympathy begg suppose evidence misconduct declare explain proceed utter deep regret hasty expression 
195,"‘I do not know what I may have said,’ he wrote; ‘I have no doubt it was unpardonable, for I am sure my feelings were so, and that I deserve whatever I have brought on myself.

He has every right to be displeased with me.",know say write have doubt unpardonable sure feeling deserve bring submit sentence trust time bring knowledge innocent accuse have right displease 
196,"Charles pronounced this to be only Guy’s way of abusing himself; but his father saw in it a disguised admission of guilt. It was thought, also, to be bad sign that Guy intended to remain at South Moor till the end of the vacation, though Charles argued that he must be somewhere; and if they wished to keep him out of mischief, why exile him from Hollywell! He would hardly listen to his mother’s representation, that on Amy’s account it would not be right to have him there till the mystery was cleared up.",pronounce guy way abuse father see disguise admission guilt think bad sign intend remain end vacation argue wish keep mischief exile listen mother representation account right have mystery clear 
197,"He tried to stir his father up to go and see Guy at St. Mildred’s, and investigate matters for himself; but, though Mr. Edmonstone would have liked the appearance of being important, this failed, because Philip declared it to be unadvisable, knowing that it would be no investigation at all, and that his uncle would be talked over directly. Next, Charles would have persuaded Philip himself to go, but the arrangements about his leave did not make this convenient; and it was put off till he should pay his farewell visit to his sister, in October. Lastly, Charles wrote to Mrs. Henley, entreating her to give him some information about this mysterious evidence which was wanting, but her reply was a complete ‘set down’ for interference in a matter with which he had no concern.",try stir father go see guy investigate matter like appearance important fail declare unadvisable know investigation uncle talk persuade go arrangement leave make convenient put pay farewell visit sister write entreat give information mysterious evidence want reply complete set interference matter have concern

In fact, the post seldom came in without occasioning a fresh dispute, which only had the effect of keeping up the heat of Mr. Edmonstone’s displeasure, and making the whole house uncomfortable.",angry fact post come occasion fresh dispute have effect keep heat displeasure make whole house uncomfortable 
199,"Fretfulness and ill-humour seemed to have taken possession of Charles and his father. Such a state of things had not prevailed since Guy’s arrival: Hollywell was hardly like the same house; Mrs. Edmonstone and Laura could do nothing without being grumbled at or scolded by one or other of the gentlemen; even Amy now and then came in for a little petulance on her father’s part, and Charles could not always forgive her for saying in her mournful, submissive tome,--‘It is of no use to talk about it!’",fretfulness ill humour seem take possession father state thing prevail arrival same house do grumble scold other gentleman come little petulance father part forgive say mournful submissive tome use talk
