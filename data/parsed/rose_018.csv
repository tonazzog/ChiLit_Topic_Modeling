1,"CHAPTER XVII. HOW A TREMENDOUS BATTLE TOOK PLACE, AND WHO WON IT",tremendous battle take place won 
2,"As soon as King Padella heard, what we know already, that his victim, the lovely Rosalba, had escaped him, His Majesty’s fury knew no bounds, and he pitched the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chamberlain, and every officer of the Crown whom he could set eyes on, into the cauldron of boiling oil prepared for the Princess. Then he ordered out his whole army, horse, foot, and artillery; and set forth at the head of an innumerable host, and I should think twenty thousand drummers, trumpeters, and fifers.",hear know victim lovely escape fury know bound pitch officer set eye cauldron boil oil prepare order whole army horse foot artillery set head innumerable host think drummer trumpeter fifer 
3,"King Giglio’s advance guard, you may be sure, kept that monarch acquainted with the enemy’s dealings, and he was in nowise disconcerted. He was much too polite to alarm the Princess, his lovely guest, with any unnecessary rumours of battles impending; on the contrary, he did everything to amuse and divert her; gave her a most elegant breakfast, dinner, lunch, and got up a ball for her that evening, when he danced with her every single dance.",advance guard sure keep monarch acquainted enemy dealing nowise disconcert polite alarm lovely guest unnecessary rumour battle impend contrary do amuse divert give elegant breakfast dinner lunch get ball evening dance single dance 
4,"Poor Bulbo was taken into favour again, and allowed to go quite free now. He had new clothes given him, was called ‘My good cousin’ by His Majesty, and was treated with the greatest distinction by everybody. But it was easy to see he was very melancholy. The fact is, the sight of Betsinda, who looked perfectly lovely in an elegant new dress, set poor Bulbo frantic in love with her again. And he never thought about Angelica, now Princess Bulbo, whom he had left at home, and who, as we know, did not care much about him.",poor take favour allow go free have new clothes give call good cousin’ treat great distinction easy see melancholy fact sight look lovely elegant new dress set poor frantic love think leave home know care much 
5,"The King, dancing the twenty-fifth polka with Rosalba, remarked with wonder the ring she wore; and then Rosalba told him how she had got it from Gruffanuff, who no doubt had picked it up when Angelica flung it away.",dance fifth polka remark wonder ring wear tell get pick flung 
6,"‘Yes,’ says the Fairy Blackstick, who had come to see the young people, and who had very likely certain plans regarding them. ‘That ring I gave the Queen, Giglio’s mother, who was not, saving your presence, a very wise woman; it is enchanted, and whoever wears it looks beautiful in the eyes of the world, I made poor Prince Bulbo, when he was christened, the present of a rose which made him look handsome while he had it; but he gave it to Angelica, who instantly looked beautiful again, whilst Bulbo relapsed into his natural plainness.’",say come see young person have certain plan regard ring give mother save presence wise woman enchanted wear look beautiful eye world make poor christen present rose make look handsome have give look beautiful relaps natural plainness 
7,"‘Rosalba needs no ring, I am sure,’ says Giglio, with a low bow. ‘She is beautiful enough, in my eyes, without any enchanted aid.’",need ring sure say low bow beautiful eye enchanted aid 
8,"‘Oh, sir!’ said Rosalba.",sir say 
9,"‘Take off the ring and try,’ said the King, and resolutely drew the ring off her finger. In HIS eyes she looked just as handsome as before!",take ring try say draw ring finger eye look handsome 
10,"The King was thinking of throwing the ring away, as it was so dangerous and made all the people so mad about Rosalba; but being a Prince of great humour, and good humour too, he cast eyes upon a poor youth who happened to be looking on very disconsolately, and said--",think throw ring dangerous make person mad great humour good humour cast eye poor youth happen look say 
11,"‘Bulbo, my poor lad! come and try on this ring. The Princess Rosalba makes it a present to you.’",poor lad come try ring make present 
12,"The magic properties of this ring were uncommonly strong, for no sooner had Bulbo put it on, but lo and behold, he appeared a personable, agreeable young Prince enough--with a fine complexion, fair hair, rather stout, and with bandy legs; but these were encased in such a beautiful pair of yellow morocco boots that nobody remarked them. And Bulbo’s spirits rose up almost immediately after he had looked in the glass, and he talked to their Majesties in the most lively, agreeable manner, and danced opposite the Queen with one of the prettiest maids of honour, and after looking at Her Majesty, could not help saying--",magic property ring strong put appear personable agreeable young fine complexion fair hair stout bandy leg encase beautiful pair yellow morocco boot remark spirit rise look glass talk lively agreeable manner dance prettiest maid honour look help say 
13,"‘How very odd! she is very pretty, but not so EXTRAORDINARILY handsome.’",odd pretty handsome 
14,"‘Oh no, by no means!’ says the Maid of Honour.",means say 
15,"‘But what care I, dear sir,’ says the Queen, who overheard them, ‘if YOU think I am good-looking enough?’",care dear sir say overhear think good look 
16,"His Majesty’s glance in reply to this affectionate speech was such that no painter could draw it. And the Fairy Blackstick said, ‘Bless you, my darling children! Now you are united and happy; and now you see what I said from the first, that a little misfortune has done you both good. YOU, Giglio, had you been bred in prosperity, would scarcely have learned to read or write--you would have been idle and extravagant, and could not have been a good King as now you will be. You, Rosalba, would have been so flattered, that your little head might have been turned like Angelica’s, who thought herself too good for Giglio.’",glance reply affectionate speech such painter draw say bless darling child united happy see say first little misfortune do good breed prosperity learn read write idle extravagant good flattered little head turn think good 
17,"‘As if anybody could be good enough for HIM,’ cried Rosalba.",good cry 
18,"‘Oh, you, you darling!’ says Giglio. And so she was; and he was just holding out his arms in order to give her a hug before the whole company, when a messenger came rushing in, and said, ‘My Lord, the enemy!’",darling say hold arm order give hug whole company messenger come rush say enemy 
19,‘To arms!’ cries Giglio.,arm cry 
20,"‘Oh, mercy!’ says Rosalba, and fainted of course.",say faint course 
21,"He snatched one kiss from her lips, and rushed FORTH TO THE FIELD of battle!",snatch kiss lip rush field battle 
22,"The Fairy had provided King Giglio with a suit of armour, which was not only embroidered all over with jewels, and blinding to your eyes to look at, but was water-proof, gun-proof, and sword-proof; so that in the midst of the very hottest battles His Majesty rode about as calmly as if he had been a British Grenadier at Alma. Were I engaged in fighting for my country, _I_ should like such a suit of armour as Prince Giglio wore; but, you know, he was a Prince of a fairy tale, and they always have these wonderful things.",provide suit armour embroider jewel blind eye look water proof gun proof sword proof midst hot battle ride british grenadier engage fight country like suit armour wear know fairy tale have wonderful thing 
23,"Besides the fairy armour, the Prince had a fairy horse, which would gallop at any pace you pleased; and a fairy sword, which would lengthen and run through a whole regiment of enemies at once. With such a weapon at command, I wonder, for my part, he thought of ordering his army out; but forth they all came, in magnificent new uniforms, Hedzoff and the Prince’s two college friends each commanding a division, and His Majesty prancing in person at the head of them all.",fairy armour have fairy horse gallop pace pleased fairy sword lengthen run whole regiment enemy weapon command wonder part think order army come magnificent new uniform college friend commanding division prance person head 
24,"Ah! if I had the pen of a Sir Archibald Alison, my dear friends, would I not now entertain you with the account of a most tremendous shindy? Should not fine blows be struck? dreadful wounds be delivered? arrows darken the air? cannon balls crash through the battalions? cavalry charge infantry? infantry pitch into cavalry? bugles blow; drums beat; horses neigh; fifes sing; soldiers roar, swear, hurray; officers shout out ‘Forward, my men!’ ‘This way, lads!’ ‘Give it ‘em, boys!’ ‘Fight for King Giglio, and the cause of right!’ ‘King Padella for ever!’ Would I not describe all this, I say, and in the very finest language too? But this humble pen does not possess the skill necessary for the description of combats. In a word, the overthrow of King Padella’s army was so complete, that if they had been Russians you could not have wished them to be more utterly smashed and confounded.",have pen dear friend entertain account tremendous shindy fine blow strike dreadful wound deliver arrow dark air ball crash battalion cavalry charge infantry infantry pitch cavalry bugle blow drum beat horse neigh fife sing soldier roar swear hurray officer shout man way lad give boy fight cause right describe say fine language humble pen possess skill necessary description combat word overthrow army complete wish smash confound 
25,"As for that usurping monarch, having performed acts of velour much more considerable than could be expected of a royal ruffian and usurper, who had such a bad cause, and who was so cruel to women,--as for King Padella, I say, when his army ran away, the King ran away too, kicking his first general, Prince Punchikoff, from his saddle, and galloping away on the Prince’s horse, having, indeed, had twenty-five or twenty-six of his own shot under him. Hedzoff coming up, and finding Punchikoff down, as you may imagine, very speedily disposed of HIM. Meanwhile King Padella was scampering off as hard as his horse could lay legs to ground. Fast as he scampered, I promise you somebody else galloped faster; and that individual, as no doubt you are aware, was the Royal Giglio, who kept bawling out, ‘Stay, traitor! Turn, miscreant, and defend thyself! Stand, tyrant, coward, ruffian, royal wretch, till I cut thy ugly head from thy usurping shoulders!’ And, with his fairy sword, which elongated itself at will, His Majesty kept poking and prodding Padella in the back, until that wicked monarch roared with anguish.",usurp monarch perform act velour considerable expect royal ruffian usurper have bad cause cruel woman say army run run kick first general saddle gallop horse have own shot come find imagine dispose scamper horse lay leg ground scamper promise else gallop fast individual doubt aware royal keep bawl stay traitor turn miscreant defend stand tyrant coward ruffian royal wretch cut ugly head usurp shoulder fairy sword elongate will keep poke prodd back wicked monarch roar anguish 
26,"When he was fairly brought to bay, Padella turned and dealt Prince Giglio a prodigious crack over the sconce with his battle-axe, a most enormous weapon, which had cut down I don’t know how many regiments in the course of the afternoon. But, Law bless you! though the blow fell right down on His Majesty’s helmet, it made no more impression than if Padella had struck him with a pat of butter: his battle-axe crumpled up in Padella’s hand, and the Royal Giglio laughed for very scorn at the impotent efforts of that atrocious usurper.",bring bay turn deal prodigious crack sconce battle axe enormous weapon cut know many regiment course afternoon bless blow fall helmet make more impression strike pat butter battle axe crumple hand royal laugh scorn impotent effort atrocious usurper 
27,"At the ill success of his blow the Crim Tartar monarch was justly irritated. ‘If,’ says he to Giglio, ‘you ride a fairy horse, and wear fairy armour, what on earth is the use of my hitting you? I may as well give myself up a prisoner at once. Your Majesty won’t, I suppose, be so mean as to strike a poor fellow who can’t strike again?’",ill success blow monarch irritate say ride fairy horse wear fairy armour earth use hit give prisoner majesty suppose mean strike poor fellow strike 
28,"The justice of Padella’s remark struck the magnanimous Giglio. ‘Do you yield yourself a prisoner, Padella?’ says he.",justice remark strike magnanimous yield prisoner say 
29,"‘Of course I do,’ says Padella.",course say 
30,"‘Do you acknowledge Rosalba as your rightful Queen, and give up the crown and all your treasures to your rightful mistress?’",acknowledge rightful give crown treasure rightful mistress 
31,"‘If I must, I must,’ says Padella, who was naturally very sulky.",say sulky 
32,"By this time King Giglio’s aides-de-camp had come up, whom His Majesty ordered to bind the prisoner. And they tied his hands behind him, and bound his legs tight under his horse, having set him with his face to the tail; and in this fashion he was led back to King Giglio’s quarters, and thrust into the very dungeon where young Bulbo had been confined.",time aide camp come order bind prisoner tie hand bind leg tight horse set face tail fashion lead quarter thrust very dungeon young confine 
33,"Padella (who was a very different person in the depth of his distress, to Padella, the proud wearer of the Crim Tartar crown), now most affectionately and earnestly asked to see his son--his dear eldest boy--his darling Bulbo; and that good-natured young man never once reproached his haughty parent for his unkind conduct the day before, when he would have left Bulbo to be shot without any pity, but came to see his father, and spoke to him through the grating of the door, beyond which he was not allowed to go; and brought him some sandwiches from the grand supper which His Majesty was giving above stairs, in honour of the brilliant victory which had just been achieved.",different person depth distress proud wearer crown ask see son dear old boy darling good natured young man reproach haughty parent unkind conduct day leave shoot pity come see father speak grating door allow go bring sandwich grand supper give stair honour brilliant victory achieve 
34,"‘I cannot stay with you long, sir,’ says Bulbo, who was in his best ball dress, as he handed his father in the prog, ‘I am engaged to dance the next quadrille with Her Majesty Queen Rosalba, and I hear the fiddles playing at this very moment.’",stay sir say good ball dress hand father prog engage dance next quadrille hear fiddle play very moment 
35,So Bulbo went back to the ball-room and the wretched Padella ate his solitary supper in silence and tears.,go ball room wretch eat solitary supper silence tear 
36,"All was now joy in King Giglio’s circle. Dancing, feasting, fun, illuminations, and jollifications of all sorts ensued. The people through whose villages they passed were ordered to illuminate their cottages at night, and scatter flowers on the roads during the day. They were requested, and I promise you they did not like to refuse, to serve the troops liberally with eatables and wine; besides, the army was enriched by the immense quantity of plunder which was found in King Padella’s camp, and taken from his soldiers; who (after they had given up everything) were allowed to fraternise with the conquerors; and the united forces marched back by easy stages towards King Giglio’s capital, his royal banner and that of Queen Rosalba being carried in front of the troops. Hedzoff was made a Duke and a Field-Marshal. Smith and Jones were promoted to be Earls; the Crim Tartar Order of the Pumpkin and the Paflagonian decoration of the Cucumber were freely distributed by their Majesties to the army. Queen Rosalba wore the Paflagonian Ribbon of the Cucumber across her riding-habit, whilst King Giglio never appeared without the grand Cordon of the Pumpkin. How the people cheered them as they rode along side by side! They were pronounced to be the handsomest couple ever seen: that was a matter of course; but they really WERE very handsome, and, had they been otherwise, would have looked so, they were so happy! Their Majesties were never separated during the whole day, but breakfasted, dined, and supped together always, and rode side by side, interchanging elegant compliments, and indulging in the most delightful conversation. At night, Her Majesty’s ladies of honour (who had all rallied round her the day after King Padella’s defeat) came and conducted her to the apartments prepared for her; whilst King Giglio, surrounded by his gentlemen, withdrew to his own Royal quarters. It was agreed they should be married as soon as they reached the capital, and orders were dispatched to the Archbishop of Blombodinga, to hold himself in readiness to perform the interesting ceremony. Duke Hedzoff carried the message, and gave instructions to have the Royal Castle splendidly refurnished and painted afresh. The Duke seized Glumboso, the Ex-Prime Minister, and made him refund that considerable sum of money which the old scoundrel had secreted out of the late King’s treasure. He also clapped Valoroso into prison (who, by the way, had been dethroned for some considerable period past), and when the Ex-Monarch weakly remonstrated, Hedzoff said, ‘A soldier, sir, knows but his duty; my orders are to lock you up along with the Ex-King Padella, whom I have brought hither a prisoner under guard.’ So these two Ex-Royal personages were sent for a year to the House of Correction, and thereafter were obliged to become monks of the severest Order of Flagellants, in which state, by fasting, by vigils, by flogging (which they administered to one another, humbly but resolutely), no doubt they exhibited a repentance for their past misdeeds, usurpations, and private and public crimes.",joy circle dancing feast fun illumination jollification sort ensue person village pass order illuminate cottage night scatter flower road day request promise like refuse serve troops eatables wine army enrich immense quantity plunder find camp take soldier give allow fraternise conqueror united force march easy stage capital royal banner carry front troops make promote decoration distribute army wear riding habit appear grand person cheer ride side side pronounce handsomest couple see matter course handsome look happy majesty separate whole day breakfast dine supp ride side side interchang elegant compliment indulg delightful conversation night lady honour rally day defeat come conduct apartment prepare surround gentleman withdraw own royal quarter agree marry reach capital order dispatch hold readiness perform interesting ceremony carry message give instruction have royal refurnish paint seize ex-prime make refund considerable sum money old scoundrel secret late treasure clapp prison way dethron considerable period past remonstrate say soldier sir know duty order lock bring prisoner guard ex-royal personage send year oblige become monk severest state fasting vigil flog administer doubt exhibit repentance past misdeed usurpation private public crime
