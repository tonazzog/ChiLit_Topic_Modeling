1,CHAPTER 16.,
2,"William slept as sound as if he had been on shore in England upon a soft bed in a warm room--so did old Ready; and when they awoke the next morning it was broad daylight.  The poor dogs were suffering for want of water, and it pained William to see them with their tongues out, panting and whining as they looked up to him.  ""Now, William,"" said Ready, ""shall we take our breakfast before we start, or have a walk first?""",sleep sound shore soft bed warm room old ready awoke next morning broad daylight poor dog suffer want water pain see tongue pant whine look say ready take breakfast start have walk 
3,"""Ready, I cannot really drink a drop of water myself, and I am thirsty, unless you give a little to these poor dogs.""",ready drink drop water thirsty give little poor dog 
4,"""I pity the poor dumb creatures as much as you do, Master Willy; it is kindness to ourselves and them too, which makes me refuse it to them. However, if you like, we will take a walk first, and see if we can find any water.  Let us first go to the little dell to the right, and if we do not succeed, we will try farther on where the water has run down during the rainy season.""  William was very glad to go, and away they went, followed by the dogs, Ready having taken up the spade, which he carried on his shoulder.  They soon came to the dell, and the dogs put their noses to the ground, and snuffed about.  Ready watched them; at last they lay down panting.",pity poor dumb creature do kindness make refuse like take walk see find water let go little dell right succeed try water run rainy season glad go go follow dog ready take spade carry shoulder come dell dog put nose ground snuff ready watch last lay panting 
5,"""Let us go on,"" said Ready, thoughtfully; they went on to where the run of water appeared to have been--the dogs snuffed about more eagerly than before.",let go say ready go run water appear dog snuff 
6,"""You see, William, these poor dogs are now so eager for water, that if there is any, they will find it out where we never could.  I don't expect water above-ground, but there may be some below it.  This beach is hardly far enough from the water's edge, or I should try in the sand for it.""",see poor dog eager water be find expect water ground be beach water edge try sand 
7,"""In the sand--but would it not be salt?"" replied William.",sand salt reply 
8,"""No, not if at a good distance from the sea-beach; for you see, William, the sand by degrees filters the sea-water fresh, and very often when the sand runs in a long way from the high-water mark, if you dig down, you will find good fresh water, at other times it is a little brackish, but still fit for use.""",good distance sea beach see sand degree filter sea water fresh sand run long way high water mark dig find good fresh water other time little brackish fit use 
9,"""Look, Ready, at Romulus and Remus--how hard they are digging with their paws there in the hollow.""",look ready digg paw hollow 
10,"""Thanks to Heaven that they are!  You don't know how happy you have made me feel: for, to tell you the truth, I was beginning to be alarmed.""",thanks know happy make feel tell truth begin alarm 
11,"""But why do they dig?""",dig 
12,"""Because there is water there, poor animals.  Now you see the advantage of having kept them in pain for a few hours; it is in all probability the saving of all of us, for we must either have found water or quitted this island.  Now let us help the poor dogs with the spade, and they shall soon be rewarded for their sufferings.""",be water poor animal see advantage keep pain few hour probability save find water quit island let help poor dog spade reward suffering 
13,"Ready walked quickly to where the dogs continued digging: they had already got down to the moist earth, and were so eagerly at work, that it was with difficulty he could get them out of his way to use his spade.  He had not dug two feet before the water trickled down, and in four or five minutes the dogs had sufficient to plunge their noses in, and to drink copiously.",ready walk dog continue digg get moist earth work difficulty get way use spade dig foot water trickle minute dog sufficient plunge nose drink 
14,"""Look at them! how they enjoy it!  I don't think any Israelite felt more grateful when Moses struck the rock than I do now, William.  This was the one thing wanting, but it was the one thing indispensable.  Now we have everything we can wish for on this island, and if we are only content, we may be happy--ay, much happier than are those who are worrying themselves to heap up riches, not knowing who shall gather them.  See, the poor animals have had enough at last.  Now, shall we go back to breakfast?""",look enjoy think feel grateful strike rock do thing want thing indispensable have wish island content happy happy worry heap rich know gather see poor animal have enough last go breakfast 
15,"""Yes,"" replied William: ""I shall enjoy it now, and have a good drink of water myself.""",reply enjoy have good drink water 
16,"""That is a plenteous spring, depend upon it,"" said Ready, as they walked back to where they had slept and left their knapsacks; ""but we must clear it out further up among the trees, where the sun cannot reach it, and then it will be cool, and not be dried up.  We shall have plenty of work for the next year at least, if we remain here.  Where we are now will be a capital spot to build our house on.""",plenteous spring depend say ready walk sleep leave knapsack clear tree sun reach cool dry have plenty work next year least remain capital spot build house 
17,"As soon as the breakfast was over, Ready said, ""Now we must go down and explore the other point, for you see, William, I have not yet found a passage through the reef, and as our little boat must come round this side of the island, it is at the point on this side that I must try to find an entrance.  When I was on the opposite point it did appear to me that the water was not broken close to this point; and should there be a passage we shall be very fortunate.""",breakfast ready say go explore other point see find passage reef little boat come side island point side try find entrance opposite point appear water break point be passage fortunate 
18,"They soon arrived at the end of the point of land, and found that Ready was not wrong in his supposition; the water was deep, and there was a passage many yards wide.  The sea was so smooth, and the water so clear, that they could see down to the rocky bottom, and watched the fish as they darted along.  ""Look there!"" said Willy, pointing out about fifty yards from the beach, ""a great shark, Ready!""",arrive end point land find ready wrong supposition water deep be passage many yard wide sea smooth water clear see rocky bottom watch fish dart look say point yard beach great shark ready 
19,"""Yes, I see him, sir,"" replied Ready: ""there's plenty of them here, depend upon it; and you must be very careful how you get into the water: the sharks always keep to the leeward of the island, and for one where Juno bathed your little brother, you will find fifty here.  I'm quite satisfied now, William, we shall do very well, and all we have now to think of is moving away from the other side of the island as fast as possible.""",see sir reply ready be plenty depend careful get water shark keep leeward island bath little brother find satisfied do have think move other side island possible 
20,"""Shall we go back to-day?""",go day 
21,"""Yes, I think so, for we shall only be idle here.  It is not twelve o'clock, I should think, and we shall have plenty of time.  I think we had better start at once; we will leave the spade and axe here, for it is no use taking them back again.  The musket I will take along.  But first let us go back and look at the spring, and see how the water flows.""",think idle o'clock think have plenty time think have good start leave spade axe use take musket take let go look spring see water flow 
22,"As they walked along the edge of the sandy beach they found the sea-birds hovering close to them: all of a sudden a large shoal of fish threw themselves high and dry on the sand, and they were followed by several of a larger size, which also lay flapping on the beach, while the sea-birds, darting down close to the feet of William and Ready, and seizing up the fish, flew away with them.",walk edge sandy beach find sea bird hover sudden large shoal fish throw high dry sand follow several large size lay flap beach sea bird dart foot ready seize fish fly 
23,"""How very strange!"" said William, surprised.",strange say surprise 
24,"""Yes, sir; but you see how it is--the small fish were chased by the larger ones, which are bonettas, and in their fright ran upon the beach. These bonettas were so anxious to catch them, that they came on shore also, and then the gannets picked them all up.""",sir see small fish chase large one bonetta fright run beach bonetta anxious catch come shore gannet pick 
25,"They found the hole which Ready had dug quite full of water, and, tasting it, it proved very sweet and good.  Overjoyed at this discovery, they covered up the articles they agreed to leave behind them with some boughs under the notched cocoa-nut trees, and, calling the dogs, set off on their journey back again to the cove.",find hole ready dig full water taste prove sweet good overjoy discovery cover article agree leave bough notch cocoa nut tree call dog set journey cove
