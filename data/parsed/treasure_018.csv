4,"""Far more likely it's the mutineers,"" I answered.",likely mutineer answer 
5,"""That!"" he cried. ""Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.""",cry place put gen'lemen fortune fly make doubt friend be blow reckon friend have good old stockade make year year man have headpiece barr rum match see afraid genteel 
6,"""Well,"" said I, ""that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.""",say more reason hurry join friend 
7,"""Nay, mate,"" returned Ben, ""not you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.""",mate return good boy mistake boy tell fly bring go rum see bear gen'leman get word honour forget word precious sight say precious sight more confidence nip

9,"""And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own.'""",want know find find today come have white thing hand come say say have reason own 
10,"""Well,"" said I, ""I believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?""",say believe understand have propose wish see squire doctor find find 
11,"""And when? says you,"" he added. ""Why, from about noon observation to about six bells.""",say add noon observation bell 
12,"""Good,"" said I, ""and now may I go?""",good say go 
13,"""You won't forget?"" he inquired anxiously. ""Precious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then""--still holding me--""I reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?""",forget inquire precious sight reason own say reason own mainstay man man hold reckon go see go sell wild horse draw say pirate camp say be widder morning 
14,"Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction.",interrupt loud report cannonball come tear tree pitch sand yard talk next moment take heel different direction 
15,"For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles. But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.",good hour come frequent report shake island ball keep crash wood move hide place hiding place pursue seem terrifying missile end bombardment venture direction stockade ball fall begin manner pluck heart long detour east creep shore side tree 
16,"The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket.",sun set sea breeze rustle tumble wood ruffle grey surface anchorage tide great tract sand uncover air heat day chill jacket 
17,"The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak. Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the cannonade.",lay anchore be black flag piracy fly peak look come red flash report send echo clatter more round shot whistle air last cannonade 
18,"I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum.",lay time watch bustle succeed attack man demolish axe beach stockade poor jolly boat discover mouth river great fire glow tree point ship gig keep come go man see gloomy shouting oar child be sound voice suggest rum 
19,"At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour. It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one.",length think return stockade low sandy spit enclose anchorage east join half water rise foot see distance spit rise low bush isolated rock high white colour occur white rock speak day other boat want know look 
20,"Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party.",skirt wood regain rear shoreward side stockade welcome faithful party 
21,"I had soon told my story and began to look about me. The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand. There was a porch at the door, and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind--no other than a great ship's kettle of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk ""to her bearings,"" as the captain said, among the sand.",tell story begin look log house make unsquared trunk pine roof wall floor latter stand several place much foot foot half surface sand be porch door porch little spring well artificial basin odd kind other great ship kettle iron bottom knock sink bearing captain say sand 
22,"Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire.",little leave framework house corner be stone slab lay way hearth old rusty iron basket contain fire 
23,"The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. Most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand. Very close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.",slope knoll inside stockade clear timber build house see stump fine lofty grove destroy most soil wash bury drift removal tree streamlet run kettle thick bed moss fern little creep bush green sand close stockade close defence say wood flourish high dense fir land side sea large admixture live oak 
24,"The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye.",cold evening breeze speak whistle chink rude building sprinkle floor continual rain fine sand be sand eye sand tooth sand supper sand dancing spring bottom kettle world porridge begin boil chimney square hole roof little part smoke find way rest edd house keep cough pipe eye 
25,"Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark, under the Union Jack.",add new man have face tie bandage cut get break mutineer poor old unbury lay wall stiff stark 
26,"If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.",allow sit fall blue man hand call divide watch doctor squire other tired send firewood more set dig grave doctor name cook put sentry door captain go keep spirit lend hand want 
27,"From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he did so, he had a word for me.",time time doctor come door little air rest eye smoke head have word 
28,"""That man Smollett,"" he said once, ""is a better man than I am. And when I say that it means a deal, Jim.""",man say good man say mean deal 
29,"Another time he came and was silent for a while. Then he put his head on one side, and looked at me.",time come silent while put head side look 
30,"""Is this Ben Gunn a man?"" he asked.",man ask 
31,"""I do not know, sir,"" said I. ""I am not very sure whether he's sane.""",know sir say sure sane 
32,"""If there's any doubt about the matter, he is,"" returned the doctor. ""A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim, can't expect to appear as sane as you or me. It doesn't lie in human nature. Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?""",be doubt matter return doctor man year bite nail desert island expect appear sane lie human nature cheese say have fancy 
33,"""Yes, sir, cheese,"" I answered.",sir cheese answer 
34,"""Well, Jim,"" says he, ""just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food. You've seen my snuff-box, haven't you? And you never saw me take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese--a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious. Well, that's for Ben Gunn!""",say see good come dainty food see snuff box see take snuff reason snuff box carry piece parmesan cheese cheese make nutritious 
35,"Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. A good deal of firewood had been got in, but not enough for the captain's fancy, and he shook his head over it and told us we ""must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier."" Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects.",supper eat bury old sand stand while bare head breeze good deal firewood get enough captain fancy shake head tell get tomorrow lively eat pork have good stiff glass brandy grog chief get corner discuss prospect 
36,"It appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came. But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies--rum and the climate.",appear wit end do store low starve surrender help come good hope decide kill buccaneer haul flag run reduce other wound least man shoot gun wound dead time have crack take save own life extremest care have able ally rum climate 
37,"As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before a week.",first mile hear roar sing night second doctor stake wig camp marsh unprovided remedy half back week 
38,"""So,"" he added, ""if we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to be packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to buccaneering again, I suppose.""",add shoot glad pack schooner ship get buccaneering suppose 
39,"""First ship that ever I lost,"" said Captain Smollett.",first ship lose say 
40,"I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood.",dead tired fancy get sleep great deal tossing sleep log wood 
41,The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices.,rest breakfast increase pile firewood half much waken bustle sound voice 
42,"""Flag of truce!"" I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with a cry of surprise, ""Silver himself!""",flag truce hear say cry surprise 
43,"And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall.",jump rub eye run loophole wall
