20,"""It would be a great addition to your property, Mr. Campbell,"" observed Captain Sinclair.

23,"The second day was passed as was the first, in making preparations for erecting the house, which, now that they had obtained such unexpected help, was, by the advice of Captain Sinclair, considerably enlarged beyond the size originally intended. As Mr. Campbell paid the soldiers employed a certain sum per day for their labor, he had less scruple in employing them longer. Two of them were good carpenters, and a sawpit had been dug, that they might prepare the doors and the frames for the window-sashes which Mr. Campbell had taken the precaution to bring with him. On the third day, a boat arrived from the fort bringing the men's rations and a present of two fine bucks from the commandant. Captain Sinclair went in the boat to procure some articles which he required, and returned in the evening. The weather continued fine, and in the course of a week, a great deal of timber was cut and squared. During this time, Martin had several meetings with the old hunter, and it was agreed that he should sell his property to Mr. Campbell. Money he appeared to care little about--indeed it was useless to him; gunpowder, lead, flints, blankets, and tobacco, were the principal articles requested in the barter; the amount, however, was not precisely settled. An intimacy had been struck up between the old hunter and John; in what manner it was difficult to imagine, as they both were very sparing of their words; but this was certain, that John had contrived to get across the stream somehow or another, and was now seldom at home to his meals. Martin reported that he was in the lodge of the old hunter, and that he could come to no harm; so Mrs. Campbell was satisfied.",second day pass first make preparation erect house obtain such unexpected help advice enlarge size intend pay soldier employ certain sum day labor have less scruple employ good carpenter sawpit dig prepare door frame window sashe take precaution bring third day boat arrive fort bring man ration present fine buck commandant go boat procure article require return evening weather continue fine course week great deal timber cut square time have several meeting old hunter agree sell property money appear care little useless gunpowder lead flint blanket tobacco principal article request barter amount settle intimacy strike old hunter manner difficult imagine sparing word certain contrive get stream home meal report lodge old hunter come harm satisfied

31,"""No, miss,"" interrupted Martin, ""you can't be too young here; the sooner a boy is useful the better; and the boy with a gun is almost as good as a man; for the gun kills equally as well if pointed true.
