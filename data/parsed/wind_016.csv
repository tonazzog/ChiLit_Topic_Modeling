1,CHAPTER XVI. DIAMOND MAKES A BEGINNING,make beginning 
2," THE wind blew loud, but Diamond slept a deep sleep, and never heard it. My own impression is that every time when Diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning, he had been all that night at the back of the north wind. I am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed, and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day. Indeed he said this much, though not to me--that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind, he could not tell what--could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance, or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore. Sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows--over the shallows, you, know; but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard--how can I tell? I don’t know what I know, I only know what I think; and to tell the truth, I am more for the swallows than the sparrows. When he knew he was coming awake, he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song, one he had not heard before--a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one; but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind, ever as he came awaker--as he would say--one line faded away out of it, and then another, and then another, till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies, or something else very common, but with all the commonness polished off it, and the lovely soul of it, which people so seldom see, and, alas! yet seldomer believe in, shining out. But after that he would sing the oddest, loveliest little songs to the baby--of his own making, his mother said; but Diamond said he did not make them; they were made somewhere inside him, and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out.",wind blow sleep deep sleep hear own impression time sleep remember morning night back north wind sure wake refresh feel quiet hopeful day say much wake sleep be mind tell tell last sound river die distance word endless song mother read sea shore think twittering swallow shallow know chirping dingy sparrow pick breakfast yard tell know know know think tell truth more swallow sparrow know come try hard keep hold word seem new song hear song word music appear think get fix mind come say line fade last be leave lovely picture water grass daisy else common commonness polished lovely soul person see seldomer believe shine sing oddest loveliest little song baby own making mother say say make make know come 
3,"When he woke that first morning he got up at once, saying to himself, “I’ve been ill long enough, and have given a great deal of trouble; I must try and be of use now, and help my mother.” When he went into her room he found her lighting the fire, and his father just getting out of bed. They had only the one room, besides the little one, not much more than a closet, in which Diamond slept. He began at once to set things to rights, but the baby waking up, he took him, and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready. She was looking gloomy, and his father was silent; and indeed except Diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows, he too would have grown miserable, and then they would have been all miserable together. But to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves, and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people. For our Selves will always do pretty well if we don’t pay them too much attention. Our Selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games, but when we begin to interfere with them, and make them presents of too nice playthings, or too many sweet things, they begin at once to fret and spoil.",wake first morning get say ill give great deal trouble try use help mother go room find light fire father get bed have room little one more closet sleep begin set thing right baby wake take nurse mother get breakfast ready look gloomy father silent do keep misery try get door window grow miserable miserable try make other comfortable only way get comfortable come able think help other person selve do pay much attention selve little child happy leave own game begin interfere make present nice plaything many sweet thing begin fret spoil 
4,"“Why, Diamond, child!” said his mother at last, “you’re as good to your mother as if you were a girl--nursing the baby, and toasting the bread, and sweeping up the hearth! I declare a body would think you had been among the fairies.”",child say mother last good mother girl nurse baby toast bread sweep hearth declare body think fairy 
5,"Could Diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure? You see when he forgot his Self his mother took care of his Self, and loved and praised his Self. Our own praises poison our Selves, and puff and swell them up, till they lose all shape and beauty, and become like great toadstools. But the praises of father or mother do our Selves good, and comfort them and make them beautiful. They never do them any harm. If they do any harm, it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them, and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous.",have great praise great pleasure see forget self mother take care self love praise self own praise poison selve puff swell lose shape beauty become great toadstool praise father mother do selve good comfort make beautiful do harm do harm come mixing own praise turn nasty slimy poisonous 
6,"When his father had finished his breakfast, which he did rather in a hurry, he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab.",father finish breakfast do hurry get go yard get horse put cab 
7,"“Won’t you come and see the cab, Diamond?” he said.",come see cab say 
8,"“Yes, please, father--if mother can spare me a minute,” answered Diamond.",father mother spare minute answer 
9,"“Bless the child! I don’t want him,” said his mother cheerfully.",bless child want say mother 
10,"But as he was following his father out of the door, she called him back.",follow father door call 
11,"“Diamond, just hold the baby one minute. I have something to say to your father.”",hold baby minute have say father 
12,"So Diamond sat down again, took the baby in his lap, and began poking his face into its little body, laughing and singing all the while, so that the baby crowed like a little bantam. And what he sang was something like this--such nonsense to those that couldn’t understand it! but not to the baby, who got all the good in the world out of it:-- baby’s a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby’s the bonniest and baby’s the funniest and baby’s the shiniest and baby’s the tiniest and baby’s the merriest and baby’s the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother’s the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father’s the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that’s baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby and baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby--",sit take baby lap begin poke face little body laugh sing while baby crow little bantam sing such nonsense understand baby get good world baby sleeping wake baby swallow merriest fellow have yellowest child go sleep snore gaby disturbing mother father brother boring ear snoring snoring snoring other particular wake baby sit perpendicular hark gush hark rush sheep woolliest lamb unruliest tail whit eye brightest baby bonniest baby funny baby shiniest baby tiniest baby merriest baby worriest lamb plague dam mother whitest dam feed lamb go crop cropp stop stop father good swallow build nest shine shallow have merriest child baby baby baby baby 
13," Here Diamond’s knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals. His mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song, and came in with the tears in her eyes. She took the baby from him, gave him a kiss, and told him to run to his father.",knee go wild dance toss baby shake laughter immoderate peal mother listen door last few line song come tear eye take baby give kiss tell run father 
14,"By the time Diamond got into the yard, the horse was between the shafts, and his father was looping the traces on. Diamond went round to look at the horse. The sight of him made him feel very queer. He did not know much about different horses, and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him. But he could not make it out. This was Diamond and it wasn’t Diamond. Diamond didn’t hang his head like that; yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that Diamond used to hold so high. Diamond’s bones didn’t show through his skin like that; but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like Diamond’s skin; and the bones might be Diamond’s bones, for he had never seen the shape of them. But when he came round in front of the old horse, and he put out his long neck, and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him, then Diamond saw it could be no other than old Diamond, and he did just as his father had done before--put his arms round his neck and cried--but not much.",time get yard horse shaft father loop trace go look horse sight make feel queer know much different horse other horse own same make hang head head hang one use hold high bone show skin skin push shape skin bone bone see shape come front old horse put long neck begin sniff rub upper lip nose see other old father do put arm neck cry much 
15,"“Ain’t it jolly, father?” he said. “Was there ever anybody so lucky as me? Dear old Diamond!”",jolly father say be lucky dear old 
16,"And he hugged the horse again, and kissed both his big hairy cheeks. He could only manage one at a time, however--the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head.",hugge horse kiss big hairy cheek manage time other cheek other side big head 
17,"His father mounted the box with just the same air, as Diamond thought, with which he had used to get upon the coach-box, and Diamond said to himself, “Father’s as grand as ever anyhow.” He had kept his brown livery-coat, only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead, because they did not think it polite to Mr. Coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab. Old Diamond had kept just his collar; and that had the silver crest upon it still, for his master thought nobody would notice that, and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him--not unpleasantly, seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse’s that they had come down in the world together.",father mount box same air think use get coach box say grand keep brown livery coat wife take silver button put brass one think polite fall fortune let crest see box cab old keep collar have silver crest master think notice let remain memorial good day remind see fault old horse come world 
18,"“Oh, father, do let me drive a bit,” said Diamond, jumping up on the box beside him.",father let drive bit say jump box 
19,"His father changed places with him at once, putting the reins into his hands. Diamond gathered them up eagerly.",father change place put rein hand gather 
20,"“Don’t pull at his mouth,” said his father, “just feel, at it gently to let him know you’re there and attending to him. That’s what I call talking to him through the reins.”",pull mouth say father feel let know attend call talk rein 
21,"“Yes, father, I understand,” said Diamond. Then to the horse he said, “Go on Diamond.” And old Diamond’s ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy.",father understand say horse say go old ponderous bulk begin move voice little boy 
22,"But before they had reached the entrance of the mews, another voice called after young Diamond, which, in his turn, he had to obey, for it was that of his mother. “Diamond! Diamond!” it cried; and Diamond pulled the reins, and the horse stood still as a stone.",reach entrance mew voice call young turn have obey mother diamond diamond cry pull rein horse stand stone 
23,"“Husband,” said his mother, coming up, “you’re never going to trust him with the reins--a baby like that?”",husband say mother come go trust rein baby 
24,"“He must learn some day, and he can’t begin too soon. I see already he’s a born coachman,” said his father proudly. “And I don’t see well how he could escape it, for my father and my grandfather, that’s his great-grandfather, was all coachmen, I’m told; so it must come natural to him, any one would think. Besides, you see, old Diamond’s as proud of him as we are our own selves, wife. Don’t you see how he’s turning round his ears, with the mouths of them open, for the first word he speaks to tumble in? He’s too well bred to turn his head, you know.”",learn day begin see bear coachman say father see escape father grandfather great grandfather coachmen tell come natural think see old proud own selve wife see turn ear mouth open first word speak tumble breed turn head know 
25,"“Well, but, husband, I can’t do without him to-day. Everything’s got to be done, you know. It’s my first day here. And there’s that baby!”",husband do day get do know first day be baby 
26,"“Bless you, wife! I never meant to take him away--only to the bottom of Endell Street. He can watch his way back.”",bless wife mean take bottom watch way 
27,"“No thank you, father; not to-day,” said Diamond. “Mother wants me. Perhaps she’ll let me go another day.”",thank father day say mother want let go day 
28,"“Very well, my man,” said his father, and took the reins which Diamond was holding out to him.",man say father take rein hold 
29,"Diamond got down, a little disappointed of course, and went with his mother, who was too pleased to speak. She only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her.",get little disappointed course go mother pleased speak take hold hand tight afraid run glad leave 
30,"Now, although they did not know it, the owner of the stables, the same man who had sold the horse to his father, had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors, with his hands in his pockets, and had heard and seen all that passed; and from that day John Stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy. And this was the beginning of what came of it.",know owner stable same man sell horse father stand stable door hand pocket hear see pass day take great fancy little boy beginning come 
31,"The same evening, just as Diamond was feeling tired of the day’s work, and wishing his father would come home, Mr. Stonecrop knocked at the door. His mother went and opened it.",same evening feel tired day work wish father come knock door mother go open 
32,"“Good evening, ma’am,” said he. “Is the little master in?”",good evening say little master 
33,"“Yes, to be sure he is--at your service, I’m sure, Mr. Stonecrop,” said his mother.",sure service sure say mother 
34,"“No, no, ma’am; it’s I’m at his service. I’m just a-going out with my own cab, and if he likes to come with me, he shall drive my old horse till he’s tired.”",service go own cab like come drive old horse tired 
35,"“It’s getting rather late for him,” said his mother thoughtfully. “You see he’s been an invalid.”",get late say mother see invalid 
36,"Diamond thought, what a funny thing! How could he have been an invalid when he did not even know what the word meant? But, of course, his mother was right.",think funny thing invalid know word mean course mother right 
37,"“Oh, well,” said Mr. Stonecrop, “I can just let him drive through Bloomsbury Square, and then he shall run home again.”",say let drive run 
38,"“Very good, sir. And I’m much obliged to you,” said his mother. And Diamond, dancing with delight, got his cap, put his hand in Mr. Stonecrop’s, and went with him to the yard where the cab was waiting. He did not think the horse looked nearly so nice as Diamond, nor Mr. Stonecrop nearly so grand as his father; but he was none, the less pleased. He got up on the box, and his new friend got up beside him.",good sir oblige say mother dance delight get cap put hand go yard cab wait think horse look nice grand father pleased get box new friend get 
39,"“What’s the horse’s name?” whispered Diamond, as he took the reins from the man.",horse name whisper take rein man 
40,"“It’s not a nice name,” said Mr. Stonecrop. “You needn’t call him by it. I didn’t give it him. He’ll go well enough without it. Give the boy a whip, Jack. I never carries one when I drive old----”",nice name say call give go give boy whip carry drive old 
41,"He didn’t finish the sentence. Jack handed Diamond a whip, with which, by holding it half down the stick, he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse; and away he went.",finish sentence hand whip hold half stick manage flack haunch horse go 
42,"“Mind the gate,” said Mr. Stonecrop; and Diamond did mind the gate, and guided the nameless horse through it in safety, pulling him this way and that according as was necessary. Diamond learned to drive all the sooner that he had been accustomed to do what he was told, and could obey the smallest hint in a moment. Nothing helps one to get on like that. Some people don’t know how to do what they are told; they have not been used to it, and they neither understand quickly nor are able to turn what they do understand into action quickly. With an obedient mind one learns the rights of things fast enough; for it is the law of the universe, and to obey is to understand.",mind gate say mind gate guide nameless horse safety pull way accord necessary learn drive soon accustom do tell obey small hint moment help get person know do tell use understand able turn understand action obedient mind learn right thing law universe obey understand 
43,"“Look out!” cried Mr. Stonecrop, as they were turning the corner into Bloomsbury Square.",look cry turn corner 
44,"It was getting dusky now. A cab was approaching rather rapidly from the opposite direction, and Diamond pulling aside, and the other driver pulling up, they only just escaped a collision. Then they knew each other.",get dusky cab approach opposite direction pull other driver pull escape collision know other 
45,"“Why, Diamond, it’s a bad beginning to run into your own father,” cried the driver.",bad beginning run own father cry driver 
46,"“But, father, wouldn’t it have been a bad ending to run into your own son?” said Diamond in return; and the two men laughed heartily.",father bad ending run own son say return man laugh 
47,"“This is very kind of you, I’m sure, Stonecrop,” said his father.",kind sure say father 
48,"“Not a bit. He’s a brave fellow, and’ll be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two. But I think you’d better let him drive you home now, for his mother don’t like his having over much of the night air, and I promised not to take him farther than the square.”",bit brave fellow fit drive own hook week think let drive mother like have much night air promise take square 
49,"“Come along then, Diamond,” said his father, as he brought his cab up to the other, and moved off the box to the seat beside it. Diamond jumped across, caught at the reins, said “Good-night, and thank you, Mr. Stonecrop,” and drove away home, feeling more of a man than he had ever yet had a chance of feeling in all his life. Nor did his father find it necessary to give him a single hint as to his driving. Only I suspect the fact that it was old Diamond, and old Diamond on his way to his stable, may have had something to do with young Diamond’s success.",come say father bring cab other move box seat jump catch rein say good night thank drive feel more man have chance feel life father find necessary give single hint driving suspect fact old old way stable have do young success 
50,"“Well, child,” said his mother, when he entered the room, “you’ve not been long gone.”",child say mother enter room long gone 
51,"“No, mother; here I am. Give me the baby.”",mother give baby 
52,"“The baby’s asleep,” said his mother.",baby asleep say mother 
53,"“Then give him to me, and I’ll lay him down.”",give lay 
54,"But as Diamond took him, he woke up and began to laugh. For he was indeed one of the merriest children. And no wonder, for he was as plump as a plum-pudding, and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time. Diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him.",take wake begin laugh merriest child wonder plump plum pudding have ache pain last more minute time sit begin sing

56," When Diamond’s rhymes grew scarce, he always began dancing the baby. Some people wondered that such a child could rhyme as he did, but his rhymes were not very good, for he was only trying to remember what he had heard the river sing at the back of the north wind.",rhyme grow scarce begin dance baby person wonder child rhyme rhyme good try remember hear river sing back north wind
