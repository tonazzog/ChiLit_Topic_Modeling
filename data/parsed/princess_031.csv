1,CHAPTER XXXI. THE SUBTERRANEAN WATERS,subterranean 
2," THE king's harper, who always formed a part of his escort, was chanting a ballad which he made as he went on playing on his instrument--about the princess and the goblins, and the prowess of Curdie, when all at once he ceased, with his eyes on one of the doors of the hall. Thereupon the eyes of the king and his guests turned thitherward also. The next moment, through the open doorway came the princess Irene. She went straight up to her father, with her right hand stretched out a little sideways, and her forefinger, as her father and Curdie understood, feeling its way along the invisible thread. The king took her on his knee, and she said in his ear--",king harper form part escort chant ballad make go play instrument princess goblin prowess cease eye door hall eye king guest turn thitherward next moment open doorway come princess go father right hand stretch little forefinger father understand feel way invisible thread king take knee say ear

15,"Before he had reached the gate, the noise had grown to a great thundering roar, and the ground trembled beneath their feet, and before the last of them had crossed the court, out after them from the great hall-door came a huge rush of turbid water, and almost swept them away. But they got safe out of the gate and up the mountain, while the torrent went roaring down the road into the valley beneath.",reach gate noise grow great thundering roar ground tremble foot last cross court great hall door come huge rush turbid water sweep get safe gate mountain torrent go roar road valley

18,"""Now, Curdie,"" said the king, ""what does it mean! Is this what you expected?""",say king mean expect 
19,"""It is, your Majesty,"" said Curdie; and proceeded to tell him about the second scheme of the goblins, who, fancying the miners of more importance to the upper world than they were, had resolved, if they should fail in carrying off the king's daughter, to flood the mine and drown the miners. Then he explained what the miners had done to prevent it. The goblins had, in pursuance of their design, let loose all the underground reservoirs and streams, expecting the water to run down into the mine, which was lower than their part of the mountain, for they had, as they supposed, not knowing of the solid wall close behind, broken a passage through into it. But the readiest outlet the water could find had turned out to be the tunnel they had made to the king's house, the possibility of which catastrophe had not occurred to the mind of the young miner until he placed his ear close to the floor of the hall.",say proceed tell second scheme goblin fancy miner more importance upper world resolve fail carry king daughter flood drown miner explain miner do prevent goblin pursuance design let lose underground reservoir stream expect water run mine low part mountain suppose know solid wall break passage readiest outlet water find turn tunnel make king house possibility catastrophe occur mind young miner place ear floor hall

23,"""Do,"" said the king.",say king 
24,"Curdie gathered the men-at-arms, and took them over the garden wall, and so to the stables. They found their horses in terror; the water was rising fast around them, and it was quite time they were got out. But there was no way to get them out, except by riding them through the stream, which was now pouring from the lower windows as well as the door. As one horse was quite enough for any man to manage through such a torrent, Curdie got on the king's white charger, and leading the way, brought them all in safety to the rising ground.",gather man arm take garden wall stable find horse terror water rise time get be way get ride stream pour low window door horse enough man manage torrent get king white charge lead way bring safety rise ground

The light and the pigeon vanished together.",take princess turn eye globe light same moment shoot white bird descend outstretched wing make circle king princess glide light pigeon vanish

We have a long ride before us.""",child say king cold have run boy fetch lay hand keep princess warm have long ride 
33,"Curdie was gone in a moment, and soon returned with a great rich fur, and the news that dead goblins were tossing about in the current through the house. They had been caught in their own snare; instead of the mine they had flooded their own country, whence they were now swept up drowned. Irene shuddered, but the king held her close to his bosom. Then he turned to Sir Walter, and said--",go moment return great rich fur news dead goblin toss current house catch own snare flood own country sweep drown shudder king hold bosom turn say
