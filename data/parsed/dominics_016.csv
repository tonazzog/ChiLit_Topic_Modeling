8,"""Well, I mean I'm not doing much good.  There's that young brother of mine, for instance.  What good have I been to him?  There have I let him go and do just what he likes, and not looked after him a bit ever since he came here.""",mean do good be young brother instance good let go do like look bit come

18,"""Yes, and set me down as posing as a martyr or a saint!  No!  I'd sooner pass as a coward than set up as a saint when I'm not one.  Why, Wray, if you'll believe me, I've been a worse Christian since I began to try to be one, than I ever was before.  I'm for ever losing my temper, and--""",set pose martyr saint pass coward set saint believe bad begin try lose temper

21,"""Well, I don't know,"" said Wraysford, walking to the window and looking out.  ""Ever since you told me of it, I've been trying myself in a mild way to go straight.  But it's desperate hard work.""",know say walk window look tell try mild way go desperate hard work 
22,"""Desperate hard work even if you try in more than a mild way,"" said Oliver.",desperate hard work try more mild way say 
23,"Both were silent for a little, and then Oliver, hurriedly changing the subject, said, ""And then, to proceed with my growl, I'm certain to come a howler over the Nightingale.""",silent little change subject say proceed growl certain come howler 
24,Wraysford turned from the window with a laugh.,turn window laugh

31,"""Whatever's up down there?""",

33,"""All right!"" said Oliver.  ""Who won the match?""",right say win match 
34,"""Why, what a question!  Do you suppose a match between Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles _ever_ came to an end?  They had a free fight at the end of the first innings.  The Tadpole umpire gave one of his own men `not out' when he hit his wicket, and they made a personal question of it, and fell out.  Your young brother, I hear, greatly distinguished himself in the argument.""",question suppose match pig come end have free fight end first inning umpire give own man hit wicket make personal question fall young brother hear distinguish argument 
35,"""Well, it doesn't seem to interfere with their spirits now, to judge of the row they are making.  Just listen!""",seem interfere spirit judge row make listen 
36,"By this time they had reached the door of the Fourth Junior room, whence proceeded a noise such as one often hears in a certain popular department of the Zoological Gardens.  Amid the tumult and hubbub the two friends had not much difficulty in slipping in unobserved and seating themselves comfortably in an obscure corner of the festive apartment, behind a pyramid of piled-up chairs and forms.",time reach door fourth room proceed noise such hear certain popular department zoological tumult hubbub friend have much difficulty slip unobserved seating obscure corner festive apartment pyramid pile chair form 
37,"The Junior ""cricket feast"" was an institution in Saint Dominic's, and was an occasion when any one who had nerves to be excruciated or ear-drums to be broken took care to keep out of the way.  In place of the usual desks and forms, a long table ran down the room, round which some fifty or sixty urchins sat, regaling themselves with what was left of a vast spread of plum-cake, buns, and ginger-beer.  How these banquets were provided was always a mystery to outsiders.  Some said a levy of threepence a head was made; others, that every boy was bound in honour to contribute something eatable to the feast; and others averred that every boy had to bring his own bag and bottle, and no more.  Be that as it might, the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles at present assembled looked uncommonly tight about the jackets after it all, and not one had the appearance of actual starvation written on his lineaments.",cricket feast institution occasion one have nerve excruciated ear drum break take care keep way place usual desk form long table run room urchin sit regale leave vast spread plum cake bun ginger beer banquet provide mystery outsider say levy threepence head make other boy bind honour contribute eatable feast other averr boy have bring own bag bottle more guinea pig tadpole present assemble look tight jacket have appearance actual starvation write lineament 
38,"The animal part of the feast, however, was now over, and the intellectual was beginning.  The tremendous noise which had brought Oliver and Wraysford on to the scene had indeed been but the applause which followed the chairman's opening song--a musical effort which was imperatively encored by a large and enthusiastic audience.",animal part feast intellectual begin tremendous noise bring scene applause follow chairman open song musical effort encore large enthusiastic audience 
39,"The chairman, by the way, was no other than our friend Bramble, who by reason of seniority--he had been two years in the Fourth Junior, and showed no signs of rising higher all his life--claimed to preside on all such occasions.  He sat up at the top end in stately glory, higher than the rest by the thickness of a Liddell and Scott, which was placed on his chair to lift him up to the required elevation, blushingly receiving the applause with which his song was greeted, and modestly volunteering to sing it again if the fellows liked.",chairman way other friend reason seniority year fourth show sign rise high life claim preside such occasion sit top end stately glory high rest thickness place chair lift require elevation receive applause song greet volunteering sing fellow like 
40,"The fellows did like.  Mr Bramble mounted once more on to the seat of his chair, and saying, ""Look-out for the chorus!"" began one of the time-honoured Dominican cricket songs.  It consisted of about twelve verses altogether, but three will be quite enough for the reader.",fellow like mount seat chair say look chorus begin time honoure dominican cricket song consist verse enough reader 
41,"  ""There was a little lad,   (Well bowled!)   And a little bat he had;   (Well bowled!)   He skipped up to the wicket,   And thought he'd play some cricket,   But he didn't, for he was--   Well bowled!",be little lad bowl little bat have bowl skip wicket think play cricket bowl

44,"The virtue of the pathetic ballad was in the chorus, which was usually not sung, but spoken, and so presented a noble opportunity for variety of tone and expression, which was greedily seized upon by the riotous young gentlemen into whose mouths it was entrusted.  By the time the sad adventures of Master Walker had been rehearsed in all their twelve verses, the meeting was so hoarse that to the two elder boys it seemed as if the proceedings must necessarily come abruptly to a close for want of voice.",virtue pathetic ballad chorus sung speak present noble opportunity variety tone expression seize riotous young gentleman mouth entrust time sad adventure rehears verse meeting hoarse elder boy seem proceedings come close want voice 
45,"But no!  If the meeting was for the moment incapable of song, speech was yet possible and behold there arose Master Paul in his place to propose a toast.",meeting moment incapable song speech possible behold arise place propose toast 
46,"Now Master Paul was a Guinea-pig, and accounted a mighty man in his tribe.  Any one might have supposed that the purpose for which he had now risen was to propose in complimentary terms the health of his gallant opponents the Tadpoles.  This, however, was far from his intention.  His modesty had another theme.  ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he began.  There were no ladies present, but that didn't matter. Tremendous cheers greeted this opening.  ""You all know me; I am one of yourselves.""  Paul had borrowed this expression from the speech of a Radical orator, which had appeared recently in the papers.  Every one knew it was borrowed, for he had asked about twenty of his friends during the last week whether that wouldn't be ""a showy lead-off for his cricket feast jaw?""",guinea pig account mighty man tribe one suppose purpose rise propose complimentary term health gallant opponent intention modesty have theme lady gentleman begin be lady present matter tremendous cheer greet opening know borrow expression speech radical orator appear paper one know borrow ask friend last week showy lead cricket feast jaw 
47,"The quotation was, however, now greeted as vociferously as if it had been strictly original, and shouts of ""So you are!""",quotation greet original shout 
48,"""Bravo, Paul!"" for a while drowned the orator's voice.  When silence was restored his eloquence took a new and unexpected departure.  ""Jemmy Welch, I'll punch your head when we get outside, see if I don't!""  Jemmy Welch was a Guinea-pig who had just made a particularly good shot at the speaker's nose with a piece of plum-cake.  ""Now, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not detain you with a speech (loud cheers from all, and `Jolly good job!' from Bramble).  I shall go on speaking just as long as I choose, Bramble, so now!  (Cheers.)  I've as much right to speak as you have.  (Applause.)  You're only a stuck-up duffer.  (Terrific cheers, and a fight down at the end of the table.)  I beg to drink the health of the Guinea-pigs.  (Loud Guinea-pig cheers.)  We licked the old Tadpoles in the match.  (`No you didn't!'  `That's a cram!' and groans from the Tadpoles.)  I say we did!  Your umpire was a cheat--they always are!  We beat you hollow, didn't we, Stee Greenfield?""",while drown orator voice silence restore eloquence take new unexpected departure punch head get see guinea pig make good shot speaker nose piece plum cake lady gentleman detain speech loud cheer good job go speak choose cheer have much right speak have applause stuck duffer terrific cheer fight end table beg drink health guinea pig loud pig cheer lick old match cram groan say umpire cheat beat 
49,"""Yes, rather!"" shouted Stephen, snatching a piece of cake away from a Tadpole and shying it to a Guinea-pig.",shout snatch piece cake shy guinea pig 
50,"""That's eight matches we've won,"" proceeded Paul; ""and--all right, Spicer!  I saw you do it this time!  See if I don't pay you for it!"" whereat the speaker hurriedly quitted his seat and, amid howls and yells, proceeded to ""pay out"" Spicer.",match win proceed right see do time see pay speaker quit seat howl yell proceed pay 
51,"Meanwhile Stephen heard his name suddenly called upon for a song, an invitation he promptly obeyed.  But as the clamour was at the time deafening, and the attention of the audience was wholly monopolised by the commercial transactions taking place between Paul and Spicer, the effect of the performance was somewhat lost.  Oliver certainly did see his young brother mount up on the table, turn very red in the face, open his mouth and shut it, smile in one part, look sorrowful in another, and wave his hand above his head in another.  But that was the only intimation he had of a musical performance proceeding.  Words and tune were utterly inaudible by any one except the singer himself--even if _he_ heard them.",hear name call song invitation obey clamour time deafen attention audience monopolise commercial transaction take place effect performance lose see young brother mount table turn red face open mouth shut smile part look sorrowful wave hand head only intimation have musical performance proceed word tune inaudible one singer hear 
52,"This was getting monotonous, and the two visitors were thinking of withdrawing, when the door suddenly opened, and a dead silence prevailed.  The new-comer was the dirtiest and most ferocious-looking of all the boys in the lower school, who rushed into the room breathless, and in what would have been a white heat had his face been clean enough to show it.  ""What do you think?"" he gasped, catching hold of the back of a chair for support; ""Tony Pembury's kept me all this while brushing his clothes!  I told him it was cricket feast, but he didn't care!  What do you think of that?  Of course, you've finished all the grub; I knew you would!""",get monotonous visitor think withdraw door open dead silence prevail new comer dirtiest ferocious look boy low school rush room breathless white heat have face clean show think gasp catching hold back chair support keep brush clothes tell cricket feast care think course finish grub know 
53,This last plaintive wail of disappointment was drowned in the clamour of execration which greeted the boy's announcement.  Lesser feuds were instantly forgotten in presence of this great insult.  The most sacred traditions of Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were being trampled upon by the tyrants of the upper school!  Not even on cricket feast night was a fag to be let off fagging!,last plaintive wail disappointment drown clamour execration greet boy announcement lesser feud forget presence great insult sacred tradition pig tadpole trample tyrant upper school cricket feast night fag let fagg 
54,"It was enough!  The last straw breaks the camel's back, and the young Dominicans had now reached the point of desperation.",enough last straw break camel back young reach point desperation 
55,"It was long before silence enough could be restored, and then the redoubtable Spicer yelled out, ""Let's strike!""",long silence restore redoubtable yell let strike 
56,"The cry was taken up with yells of enthusiasm--""Strike!  No more fagging!""",cry take yell enthusiasm strike more fagging 
57,"""Any boy who fags after this,"" screamed Bramble, ""will be cut dead! Those who promise hold up your hands--mind, it's a promise!""",boy fag scream cut dead promise hold hand mind promise 
58,"There was no mistaking the temper of the meeting, every hand in the room was held up.",be mistake temper meeting hand room hold 
59,"""Mind now, no giving in!"" cried Paul.  ""Let's stick all together. Greenfield senior shall _kill_ me before I do anything more for him!""",mind give cry let stick senior _kill do more 
60,"""Poor fellow!"" whispered Oliver, laughing; ""what a lot of martyrdoms he'll have to put up with!""",poor fellow whisper laugh lot martyrdom have put 
61,"""And Pembury shall kill me,"" squealed the last comer, who had comforted himself with several crusts of plum-cakes and the dregs of about a dozen bottles of ginger-beer.  And every one protested their willingness to die in the good cause.",kill squeal last comer comfort several crust plum cake dreg bottle ginger beer one protest willingness die good cause 
62,"At this stage Oliver and Wraysford withdrew unobserved.  ""I'm afraid we've been eavesdropping,"" said Oliver.  ""Anyhow, I don't mean to take advantage of what I've heard.""",stage withdraw unobserve afraid eavesdropp say mean take advantage hear 
63,"""What a young ruffian your brother is!"" said Wraysford; ""he looked tremendously in earnest!""",young ruffian brother say look earnest 
64,"""Yes, he always is.  You'll find he'll keep his word far better than most of them.""",find keep word good most 
65,"""If he does, I'm afraid Loman will make it unpleasant for him,"" said Wraysford.",afraid make unpleasant say 
66,"""Very likely.""",likely 
67,"""Then you'll have to interfere.""",have interfere 
68,"""Why, what a bloodthirsty chap you are, Wray!  You are longing for me to quarrel with Loman.  I'll wait till young Stephen asks me to.""",bloodthirsty chap long quarrel wait young ask 
69,"""Do you think he will?  He's a proud little chap.""",think proud little chap 
70,"Oliver laughed.  ""It'll serve him right if he does get a lesson.  Did ever you see such a lot of young cannibals as those youngsters?  Are you coming to have supper with me?""",laugh serve get lesson see lot young cannibal youngster come have supper 
71,"The nine o'clock bell soon rang, and, as usual, Oliver went to his door and shouted for Paul.",o'clock bell ring usual go door shout 
72,No Paul came.,come 
73,"He shouted again and again, but the fag did not appear.  ""They mean business,"" he said.  ""What shall I do?  Paul!""",shout fag appear mean business say do 
74,"This time there came a reply down the passage--""Shan't come!""",time come reply passage come 
75,"""Ho, he!"" said Oliver; ""this is serious; they are sticking to their strike with a vengeance!  I suppose I must go and look for my fag, eh, Wray?  Discipline must be maintained.""",say serious stick strike vengeance suppose go look fag discipline maintain 
76,"So saying, Oliver stepped out into the passage and strolled off in the direction from which the rebel's voice had proceeded.  The passages were empty; only in the Fourth Junior room was there a sound of clamour.",say step passage stroll direction rebel voice proceed passage empty fourth room sound clamour 
77,"Oliver went to the door; it was shut.  He pushed; it was fortified.  He kicked on it; a defiant howl greeted him from the inside.  He called aloud on his fag; another ""Shan't come!"" was his only answer.",go door shut push fortify kick defiant howl greet inside call fag come only answer 
78,"It was getting past a joke, and Oliver's temper was, as we have seen not of the longest.  He kicked again, angrily, and ordered Paul to appear.",get joke temper see long kick order appear 
79,"The same answer was given, accompanied with the same yell, and Oliver's temper went faster than ever.  He forgot he was making himself ridiculous; he forgot he was only affording a triumph to those whom he desired to punish; he forgot the good resolutions which had held him back on a former occasion, and, giving way to sudden rage, kicked desperately at the door once more.",same answer give accompany same yell temper go fast forget make ridiculous forget afford triumph desire punish forget good resolution hold former occasion give way sudden rage kick door more 
80,"This time his forcible appeal had some effect.  The lower panel of the door gave way before the blow and crashed inwards, leaving a breach large enough to admit a football.",time forcible appeal have effect low panel door give way blow crash leave breach large admit football 
81,"It was an unlucky piece of success for Oliver, for next moment he felt his foot grabbed by half a dozen small hands within and held firmly, rendering him unable to stir from his ridiculous position.  In vain he struggled and raged; he was a tight prisoner, at the mercy of his captors.",unlucky piece success next moment feel foot grab small hand hold rendering unable stir ridiculous position vain struggle rage tight prisoner mercy captor 
82,"It was all he could do to stand on his one foot, clinging wildly to the handle of the door.  In this dignified attitude Wraysford presently found his friend, and in such a state of passion and fury as he had never before seen him.",do stand foot cling handle door dignified attitude find friend state passion fury see 
83,"To rap the array of inky knuckles inside with a ruler, and so disengage the captive foot, was the work of a minute.  Oliver stood for a moment facing the door and trembling with anger, but Wraysford, taking him gently by the arm, said, ""Come along, old boy!""",rap array inky knuckle ruler disengage captive foot work minute stand moment face door tremble anger take arm say come old boy 
84,"There was something in his voice and look which brought a sudden flush into the pale face of the angry Oliver.  Without a word, he turned from the door and accompanied his friend back to the study.  There were no long talks, no lectures, no remorseful confessions that evening.  The two talked perhaps less than usual, and when they did it was about ordinary school topics.",be voice look bring sudden flush pale face angry word turn door accompany friend study be long talk lecture remorseful confession evening talk less usual do ordinary school topic 
85,"No reference was made either then or for a long while afterwards to the events of the evening.  And yet Oliver and Wraysford, somehow, seemed more than ever drawn together, and to understand one another better after this than had ever been the case before.",reference make long while event evening seem more draw understand good case
