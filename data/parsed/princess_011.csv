1,CHAPTER XI. THE OLD LADY'S BEDROOM,old lady bedroom 
2," NOTHING more happened worth telling for some time. The autumn came and went by. There were no more flowers in the garden. The winds blew strong, and howled among the rocks. The rain fell, and drenched the few yellow and red leaves that could not get off the bare branches. Again and again there would be a glorious morning followed by a pouring afternoon, and sometimes, for a week together, there would be rain, nothing but rain, all day, and then the most lovely cloudless night, with the sky all out in full-blown stars--not one missing. But the princess could not see much of them, for she went to bed early. The winter drew on, and she found things growing dreary. When it was too stormy to go out, and she had got tired of her toys, Lootie would take her about the house, sometimes to the housekeeper's room, where the housekeeper, who was a good, kind old woman, made much of her--sometimes to the servants' hall or the kitchen, where she was not princess merely, but absolute queen, and ran a great risk of being spoiled. Sometimes she would run of herself to the room where the men-at-arms whom the king had left, sat, and they showed her their arms and accoutrements, and did what they could to amuse her. Still at times she found it very dreary, and often and often wished that her huge great grandmother had not been a dream.",happen worth tell time autumn come go be more flower garden wind blow strong howl rock rain fall drench few yellow red leave get bare branch be glorious morning follow pour afternoon week be rain rain day lovely cloudless night sky full blow star miss princess see much go bed winter draw find thing grow dreary stormy go get tired toy take house housekeeper room housekeeper good kind old woman make much servant hall kitchen princess absolute queen run great risk spoiled run room man arm king leave sit show arm accoutrement do amuse time find dreary wish huge great grandmother dream 
3,"One morning the nurse left her with the housekeeper for a while. To amuse her, she turned out the contents of an old cabinet upon the table. The little princess found her treasures, queer ancient ornaments and many things the uses of which she could not imagine, far more interesting than her own toys, and sat playing with them for two hours or more. But at length, in handling a curious old-fashioned brooch, she ran the pin of it into her thumb, and gave a little scream with the sharpness of the pain, but would have thought little more of it, had not the pain increased and her thumb begun to swell. This alarmed the housekeeper greatly. The nurse was fetched; the doctor was sent for; her hand was poulticed, and long before her usual time she was put to bed. The pain still continued, and although she fell asleep and dreamed a good many dreams, there was the pain always in every dream. At last it woke her up.",morning nurse leave housekeeper while amuse turn content old cabinet table little princess find treasure queer ancient ornament many thing use imagine interesting own toy sit play hour more length handle curious old fashioned brooch run pin thumb give little scream sharpness pain think little more pain increase thumb begin swell alarm housekeeper nurse fetched doctor send hand poultice usual time put bed pain continue fall asleep dream good many dream be pain dream last wake 
4,"The moon was shining brightly into the room. The poultice had fallen off her hand, and it was burning hot. She fancied if she could hold it into the moonlight, that would cool it. So she got out of bed, without waking the nurse who lay at the other end of the room, and went to the window. When she looked out, she saw one of the men-at-arms walking in the garden, with the moonlight glancing on his armor. She was just going to tap on the window and call him, for she wanted to tell him all about it, when she bethought herself that that might wake Lootie, and she would put her into bed again. So she resolved to go to the window of another room, and call him from there. It was so much nicer to have somebody to talk to than to lie awake in bed with the burning pain in her hand. She opened the door very gently and went through the nursery, which did not look into the garden, to go to the other window. But when she came to the foot of the old staircase, there was the moon shining down from some window high up, and making the worm-eaten oak look very strange and delicate and lovely. In a moment she was putting her little feet one after the other in the silvery path up the stair, looking behind as she went, to see the shadow they made in the middle of the silver. Some little girls would have been afraid to find themselves thus alone in the middle of the night, but Irene was a princess.",moon shine room poultice fall hand burn hot fancy hold moonlight cool get bed wake nurse lay other end room go window look see man arm walk garden moonlight glance armor go tap window call want tell bethough wake put bed resolve go window room call nice have talk lie bed burning pain hand open door go nursery look garden go other window come foot old staircase be moon shine window high make worm eat oak look strange delicate lovely moment put little foot other silvery path stair look go see shadow make middle silver little girl afraid find alone middle night princess

6,"""If she is a dream,"" she said to herself, ""then I am the likelier to find her, if I am dreaming.""",dream say likely find dreaming 
7,"So up and up she went, stair after stair, until she came to the many rooms--all just as she had seen them before. Through passage after passage she softly sped, comforting herself that if she should lose her way it would not matter much, because when she woke she would find herself in her own bed, with Lootie not far off. But as if she had known every step of the way, she walked straight to the door at the foot of the narrow stair that led to the tower.",go stair stair come many room see passage passage spe comforting lose way matter much wake find own bed know step way walk door foot narrow stair lead tower

There is only one forest where the spiders live who make this particular kind--the finest and strongest of any. I have nearly finished my present job.

37,"""I am not quite so great as all that,"" she answered, smiling almost merrily.

43,"Then she took Irene by the hand, but it was her bad hand, and Irene gave a little cry of pain.",take hand bad hand give little cry pain 
44,"""My child!"" said, her grandmother, ""what is the matter?""",child say grandmother matter 
45,"Irene held her hand into the moonlight, that the old lady might see it, and told her all about it, at which she looked grave. But she only said--""Give me your other hand""; and, having led her out upon the little dark landing, opened the door on the opposite side of it. What was Irene's surprise to see the loveliest room she had ever seen in her life! It was large and lofty, and dome-shaped. From the centre hung a lamp as round as a ball, shining as if with the brightest moonlight, which made everything visible in the room, though not so clearly that the princess could tell what many of the things were. A large oval bed stood in the middle, with a coverlid of rose-color, and velvet curtains all round it of a lovely pale blue. The walls were also blue--spangled all over with what looked like stars of silver.",hold hand moonlight old lady see tell look grave say give other hand lead little dark landing open door opposite side surprise see loveliest room see life large lofty dome shape centre hang lamp ball shine brightest moonlight make visible room princess tell many thing large oval bed stand middle coverlid rose color velvet curtain lovely pale blue wall blue spangle look star silver 
46,"The old lady left her, and going to a strange-looking cabinet, opened it and took out a curious silver casket. Then she sat down on a low chair, and calling Irene, made her kneel before her, while she looked at her hand. Having examined it, she opened the casket, and took from it a little ointment. The sweetest odor filled the room--like that of roses and lilies--as she rubbed the ointment gently all over the hot swollen hand. Her touch was so pleasant and cool, that it seemed to drive away the pain and heat wherever it came.",old lady leave go strange look cabinet open take curious silver casket sit low chair call make kneel look hand examine open casket take little ointment sweetest odor fill room rose lilie rub ointment hot swollen hand touch pleasant cool seem drive pain heat come

56,"Then she got a large silver basin, and having poured some water into it, made Irene sit on the chair, and washed her feet. This done, she was ready for bed. And oh, what a delicious bed it was into which her grandmother laid her! She hardly could have told she was lying upon anything: she felt nothing but the softness.

60,"""The better for them then,"" said the old lady. ""But it does not happen above five times in a hundred years that any one does see it. The greater part of those who do, take it for a meteor, wink their eyes, and forget it again. Besides, nobody could find the room except I pleased. Besides again--I will tell you a secret--if that light were to go out, you would fancy yourself lying in a bare garret, on a heap of old straw, and would not see one of the pleasant things round about you all the time.""",good say old lady happen time year one see great part take meteor wink eye forget find room pleased tell secret light go fancy lie bare garret heap old straw see pleasant thing time

70,"In a moment more the little princess was dreaming in the midst of the loveliest dreams--of summer seas and moonlight and mossy springs and great murmuring trees, and beds of wild flowers with such odors as she had never smelled before.
