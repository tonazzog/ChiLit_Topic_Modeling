2, Sagacious and moral remarks in regard to life--A sail!--An unexpected salute--The end of the black cat--A terrible dive--An incautious proceeding and a frightful catastrophe.,sagacious moral remark regard life sail unexpected salute end black cat terrible dive incautious proceeding frightful catastrophe 
3,"Life is a strange compound.  Peterkin used to say of it, that it beat a druggist's shop all to sticks; for, whereas the first is a compound of good and bad, the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly detestable.  And indeed the more I consider it the more I am struck with the strange mixture of good and evil that exists not only in the material earth but in our own natures.  In our own Coral Island we had experienced every variety of good that a bountiful Creator could heap on us.  Yet on the night of the storm we had seen how almost, in our case,--and altogether, no doubt, in the case of others less fortunate--all this good might be swept away for ever.  We had seen the rich fruit-trees waving in the soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign influence of the bright sun; and, the next day, we had seen these good and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, crushed and hurled to the ground in destructive devastation.  We had lived for many months in a clime for the most part so beautiful, that we had often wondered whether Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and we had seen the quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious savages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with lifeless forms; yet, among these cannibals, we had seen many symptoms of a kindly nature.  I pondered these things much, and, while I considered them, there recurred to my memory those words which I had read in my Bible,--the works of God are wonderful, and his ways past finding out.",life strange compound use say beat druggist shop stick first compound good bad other horrible compound detestable more consider more strike strange mixture good evil exist material earth own nature own coral experience variety good bountiful heap night storm see case doubt case other fortunate good sweep see rich fruit tree wave soft air tender herb shoot benign influence bright sun next day see good beautiful tree plant uproot hurricane crush hurl ground destructive devastation live many month clime most part beautiful wonder find sweet see quiet solitude paradise break ferocious savage white sand stain blood strew lifeless form cannibal see many symptom kindly nature ponder thing consider recurr memory word read work wonderful way find 
4,"After these poor savages had left us, we used to hold long and frequent conversations about them, and I noticed that Peterkin's manner was now much altered.  He did not, indeed, jest less heartily than before, but he did so less frequently, and often there was a tone of deep seriousness in his manner, if not in his words, which made him seem to Jack and me as if he had grown two years older within a few days.  But indeed I was not surprised at this, when I reflected on the awful realities which we had witnessed so lately.  We could by no means shake off a tendency to gloom for several weeks afterwards; but, as time wore away, our usual good spirits returned somewhat, and we began to think of the visit of the savages with feelings akin to those with which we recall a terrible dream.",poor savage leave use hold long frequent conversation notice manner alter jest be tone deep seriousness manner word make seem grow year old few day surprised reflect awful reality witness means shake tendency gloom several week time wear usual good spirit return begin think visit savage feeling akin recall terrible dream 
5,"One day we were all enjoying ourselves in the Water Garden, preparatory to going on a fishing excursion; for Peterkin had kept us in such constant supply of hogs that we had become quite tired of pork, and desired a change.  Peterkin was sunning himself on the ledge of rock, while we were creeping among the rocks below.  Happening to look up, I observed Peterkin cutting the most extraordinary capers and making violent gesticulations for us to come up; so I gave Jack a push, and rose immediately.",day enjoy preparatory go fishing excursion keep such constant supply hog become tired pork desire change sun ledge rock creep rock happen look observe cut extraordinary caper make violent gesticulation come give push rise 
6,"""A sail! a sail!  Ralph, look!  Jack, away on the horizon there, just over the entrance to the lagoon!"" cried Peterkin, as we scrambled up the rocks.",sail sail look horizon entrance lagoon cry scramble rock 
7,"""So it is, and a schooner, too!"" said Jack, as he proceeded hastily to dress.",schooner say proceed dress 
8,"Our hearts were thrown into a terrible flutter by this discovery, for if it should touch at our island we had no doubt the captain would be happy to give us a passage to some of the civilized islands, where we could find a ship sailing for England, or some other part of Europe.  Home, with all its associations, rushed in upon my heart like a flood, and, much though I loved the Coral Island and the bower which had now been our home so long, I felt that I could have quitted all at that moment without a sigh.  With joyful anticipations we hastened to the highest point of rock near our dwelling, and awaited the arrival of the vessel, for we now perceived that she was making straight for the island, under a steady breeze.",heart throw terrible flutter discovery touch island have doubt captain happy give passage civilized island find ship sail other part home association rush heart flood love bower home feel quit moment sigh joyful anticipation hasten high point rock dwelling await arrival vessel perceive make island steady breeze 
9,"In less than an hour she was close to the reef, where she rounded to, and backed her topsails in order to survey the coast.  Seeing this, and fearing that they might not perceive us, we all three waved pieces of cocoa-nut cloth in the air, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing them beginning to lower a boat and bustle about the decks as if they meant to land.  Suddenly a flag was run up to the peak, a little cloud of white smoke rose from the schooner's side, and, before we could guess their intentions, a cannon-shot came crashing through the bushes, carried away several cocoa-nut trees in its passage, and burst in atoms against the cliff a few yards below the spot on which we stood.",less hour close reef round back topsail order survey coast see fear perceive wave piece cocoa nut cloth air have satisfaction see begin lower boat bustle deck mean land flag run peak little cloud white smoke rise schooner side guess intention can non shot come crash bush carry several cocoa nut tree passage burst atom cliff few yard spot stand 
10,"With feelings of terror we now observed that the flag at the schooner's peak was black, with a Death's head and cross bones upon it.  As we gazed at each other in blank amazement, the word ""pirate"" escaped our lips simultaneously.",feeling terror observe flag schooner peak black head cross bone gaze other blank amazement word pirate escape lip 
11,"""What is to be done?"" cried Peterkin, as we observed a boat shoot from the vessel's side, and make for the entrance of the reef.  ""If they take us off the island, it will either be to throw us overboard for sport, or to make pirates of us.""",do cry observe boat shoot vessel side make entrance reef take island throw sport make pirate 
12,"I did not reply, but looked at Jack, as being our only resource in this emergency.  He stood with folded arms, and his eyes fixed with a grave, anxious expression on the ground.  ""There is but one hope,"" said he, turning with a sad expression of countenance to Peterkin; ""perhaps, after all, we may not have to resort to it.  If these villains are anxious to take us, they will soon overrun the whole island.  But come, follow me.""",reply look only resource emergency stand fold arm eye fix grave anxious expression ground be hope say turn sad expression countenance have resort villain anxious take overrun whole island come follow 
13,"Stopping abruptly in his speech, Jack bounded into the woods, and led us by a circuitous route to Spouting Cliff.  Here he halted, and, advancing cautiously to the rocks, glanced over their edge.  We were soon by his side, and saw the boat, which was crowded with armed men, just touching the shore.  In an instant the crew landed, formed line, and rushed up to our bower.",stop speech bound wood lead circuitous route spout halt advance rock glance edge side see boat crowd armed man touch shore instant crew land form line rush bower 
14,"In a few seconds we saw them hurrying back to the boat, one of them swinging the poor cat round his head by the tail.  On reaching the water's edge, he tossed it far into the sea, and joined his companions, who appeared to be holding a hasty council.",few second see hurry boat swing poor cat head tail reach water edge toss sea join companion appear hold hasty council 
15,"""You see what we may expect,"" said Jack bitterly.  ""The man who will wantonly kill a poor brute for sport will think little of murdering a fellow-creature.  Now, boys, we have but one chance left,--the Diamond Cave.""",see expect say man kill poor brute sport think little murdering fellow creature boy have chance leave 
16,"""The Diamond Cave!"" cried Peterkin, ""then my chance is a poor one, for I could not dive into it if all the pirates on the Pacific were at my heels.""",cry chance poor one dive pirate heel 
17,"""Nay, but,"" said I, ""we will take you down, Peterkin, if you will only trust us.""",say take trust 
18,"As I spoke, we observed the pirates scatter over the beach, and radiate, as if from a centre, towards the woods and along shore.",speak observe pirate scatter beach radiate centre wood shore 
19,"""Now, Peterkin,"" said Jack, in a solemn tone, ""you must make up your mind to do it, or we must make up our minds to die in your company.""",say solemn tone make mind do make mind die company 
20,"""Oh, Jack, my dear friend,"" cried Peterkin, turning pale, ""leave me; I don't believe they'll think it worth while to kill me.  Go, you and Ralph, and dive into the cave.""",dear friend cry turn pale leave believe think worth kill go dive cave 
21,"""That will not I,"" answered Jack quietly, while he picked up a stout cudgel from the ground.  ""So now, Ralph, we must prepare to meet these fellows.  Their motto is, 'No quarter.'  If we can manage to floor those coming in this direction, we may escape into the woods for a while.""",answer pick stout cudgel ground prepare meet fellow motto quarter manage floor come direction escape wood while 
22,"""There are five of them,"" said I; ""we have no chance.""",be say have chance 
23,"""Come, then,"" cried Peterkin, starting up, and grasping Jack convulsively by the arm, ""let us dive; I will go.""",come cry start grasp arm let dive go 
24,"Those who are not naturally expert in the water know well the feelings of horror that overwhelm them, when in it, at the bare idea of being held down, even for a few seconds,--that spasmodic, involuntary recoil from compulsory immersion which has no connection whatever with cowardice; and they will understand the amount of resolution that it required in Peterkin to allow himself to be dragged down to a depth of ten feet, and then, through a narrow tunnel, into an almost pitch-dark cavern.  But there was no alternative.  The pirates had already caught sight of us, and were now within a short distance of the rocks.",expert water know feeling horror overwhelm bare idea hold few second spasmodic involuntary recoil compulsory immersion have connection cowardice understand amount resolution require allow drag depth foot narrow tunnel pitch dark cavern be alternative pirate catch sight short distance rock 
25,Jack and I seized Peterkin by the arms.,seize arm 
26,"""Now, keep quite still, no struggling,"" said Jack, ""or we are lost.""",keep struggle say lose 
27,"Peterkin made no reply, but the stern gravity of his marble features, and the tension of his muscles, satisfied us that he had fully made up his mind to go through with it.  Just as the pirates gained the foot of the rocks, which hid us for a moment from their view, we bent over the sea, and plunged down together head foremost.  Peterkin behaved like a hero. He floated passively between us like a log of wood, and we passed the tunnel and rose into the cave in a shorter space of time than I had ever done it before.",make reply stern gravity marble feature tension muscle satisfy make mind go pirate gain foot rock hide moment view bend sea plunge head foremost behave hero float log wood pass tunnel rise cave short space time do 
28,"Peterkin drew a long, deep breath on reaching the surface; and in a few seconds we were all standing on the ledge of rock in safety.  Jack now searched for the tinder and torch, which always lay in the cave.  He soon found them, and, lighting the torch, revealed to Peterkin's wondering gaze the marvels of the place.  But we were too wet to waste much time in looking about us.  Our first care was to take off our clothes, and wring them as dry as we could.  This done, we proceeded to examine into the state of our larder, for, as Jack truly remarked, there was no knowing how long the pirates might remain on the island.",draw long deep breath reach surface few second stand ledge rock safety search tinder torch lay cave find light torch reveal wonder gaze marvel place wet waste much time look first care take clothes wring dry do proceed examine state larder remark be know pirate remain island 
29,"""Perhaps,"" said Peterkin, ""they may take it into their heads to stop here altogether, and so we shall be buried alive in this place.""",say take head stop bury alive place 
30,"""Don't you think, Peterkin, that it's the nearest thing to being drowned alive that you ever felt?"" said Jack with a smile.  ""But I've no fear of that.  These villains never stay long on shore.  The sea is their home, so you may depend upon it that they won't stay more than a day or two at the furthest.""",think near thing drown alive feel say smile have fear villain stay shore sea home depend stay more day furthest 
31,"We now began to make arrangements for spending the night in the cavern. At various periods Jack and I had conveyed cocoa nuts and other fruits, besides rolls of cocoa-nut cloth, to this submarine cave, partly for amusement, and partly from a feeling that we might possibly be driven one day to take shelter here from the savages.  Little did we imagine that the first savages who would drive us into it would be white savages, perhaps our own countrymen.  We found the cocoa-nuts in good condition, and the cooked yams, but the bread-fruits were spoiled.  We also found the cloth where we had left it; and, on opening it out, there proved to be sufficient to make a bed; which was important, as the rock was damp. Having collected it all together, we spread out our bed, placed our torch in the midst of us, and ate our supper.  It was indeed a strange chamber to feast in; and we could not help remarking on the cold, ghastly appearance of the walls, and the black water at our side, with the thick darkness beyond, and the sullen sound of the drops that fell at long intervals from the roof of the cavern into the still water; and the strong contrast between all this and our bed and supper, which, with our faces, were lit up with the deep red flame of the torch.",begin make arrangement spend night cavern various period convey cocoa nut other fruit roll cocoa nut cloth submarine cave amusement feeling drive day take shelter savage imagine first savage drive white savage own countryman find cocoa nut good condition cook yam bread fruit spoiled find cloth leave open prove sufficient make bed important rock damp collect spread bed place torch midst eat supper strange chamber feast help remark cold ghastly appearance wall black water side thick darkness sullen sound drop fall long interval roof cavern still water strong contrast bed supper face light deep red flame torch 
32,"We sat long over our meal, talking together in subdued voices, for we did not like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault above when we happened to raise them.  At last the faint light that came through the opening died away, warning us that it was night and time for rest.  We therefore put out our torch and lay down to sleep.",sit meal talk subdued voice like dismal echo ring vault happen raise last faint light come opening die warning night time rest put torch lay sleep 
33,"On awaking, it was some time ere we could collect our faculties so as to remember where we were, and we were in much uncertainty as to whether it was early or late.  We saw by the faint light that it was day, but could not guess at the hour; so Jack proposed that he should dive out and reconnoitre.",awake time collect faculty remember much uncertainty early late see faint light day guess hour propose dive reconnoitre 
34,"""No, Jack,"" said I, ""do you rest here.  You've had enough to do during the last few days.  Rest yourself now, and take care of Peterkin, while I go out to see what the pirates are about.  I'll be very careful not to expose myself, and I'll bring you word again in a short time.""",say rest have enough do last few day rest take care go see pirate careful expose bring word short time 
35,"""Very well, Ralph,"" answered Jack, ""please yourself, but don't be long; and if you'll take my advice you'll go in your clothes, for I would like to have some fresh cocoa nuts, and climbing trees without clothes is uncomfortable, to say the least of it.""",answer long take advice go clothes like have fresh cocoa nut climb tree clothes uncomfortable say least 
36,"""The pirates will be sure to keep a sharp lookout,"" said Peterkin, ""so, pray, be careful.""",pirate sure keep sharp lookout say pray careful 
37,"""No fear,"" said I; ""good-bye.""",fear say good bye 
38,"""Good-bye,"" answered my comrades.",good answer comrade 
39,"And while the words were yet sounding in my ears, I plunged into the water, and in a few seconds found myself in the open air.  On rising, I was careful to come up gently and to breathe softly, while I kept close in beside the rocks; but, as I observed no one near me, I crept slowly out, and ascended the cliff a step at a time, till I obtained a full view of the shore.  No pirates were to be seen,--even their boat was gone; but as it was possible they might have hidden themselves, I did not venture too boldly forward.  Then it occurred to me to look out to sea, when, to my surprise, I saw the pirate schooner sailing away almost hull-down on the horizon!  On seeing this I uttered a shout of joy.  Then my first impulse was to dive back to tell my companions the good news; but I checked myself, and ran to the top of the cliff, in order to make sure that the vessel I saw was indeed the pirate schooner.  I looked long and anxiously at her, and, giving vent to a deep sigh of relief, said aloud, ""Yes, there she goes; the villains have been baulked of their prey this time at least.""",word sound ear plunge water few second find open air rising careful come breathe keep rock observe creep ascend cliff step time obtain full view shore pirate see boat gone possible hide venture occur look sea surprise see pirate schooner sail hull horizon see utter shout joy first impulse dive tell companion good news check run top cliff order make sure vessel see pirate schooner look give vent deep sigh relief say go villain baulk prey time least
