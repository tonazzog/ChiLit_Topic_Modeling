1,CHAPTER 14. SIXTH VERSUS SCHOOL.,
2,"Never had a Sixth versus School Match been looked forward to with more excitement at Saint Dominic's than the present one.  Party feeling had been running high all the term, intensified on the one hand by the unpopularity of some of the monitors, and on the other by the defiant attitude of the Fifth and the tone of their organ, the _Dominican_.",have sixth look more excitement present one party feeling run high term intensify hand unpopularity monitor other defiant attitude fifth tone organ 
3,"The lower school naturally looked on with interest at this rivalry between the two head forms, the result of which, as might have been expected, was the reverse of beneficial for the discipline of the school generally.  If the big boys set a bad example and disregard rules, what can one expect of the little ones?",low school look interest rivalry head form result expect reverse beneficial discipline school big boy set bad example disregard rule expect little one 
4,"So far, anything like conflict had been avoided.  The Fifth had ""cheeked"" the Sixth, and the Sixth had snubbed the Fifth; but with the exception of Loman's assault on Oliver, which had not led to a fight, the war had been strictly one of words.  Now, however, the opposing forces were to be ranged face to face at cricket; and to the junior school the opportunity seemed a grand one for a display of partisanship one side or the other.",conflict avoid fifth cheek snubb fifth exception assault lead fight war word oppose force rang face face cricket junior school opportunity seem grand one display partisanship side other 
5,"The School Eleven, on this occasion, moreover, consisted exclusively of Fifth Form boys--a most unusual circumstance, and one which seemed to be the result quite as much of management as of accident.  At least so said the disappointed heroes of the Fourth.",occasion consist fifth form boy unusual circumstance seem result much management accident least say disappoint hero fourth 
6,"The match was, in fact--whatever it was formally styled--a match between the Sixth and the Fifth, and the partisans of either side looked upon it as a decisive event in the respective glories of the two top forms.",match fact style match sixth fifth partisan side look decisive event respective glory top form 
7,"And now the day had come.  All Saint Dominic's trooped out to the meadows, and there was a rush of small boys as usual for the front benches.  Stephen found himself along with his trusty ally, Paul, and his equally trusty enemy, Bramble, and some ten other Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, wedged like sardines upon a form that would comfortably hold six, eagerly canvassing the prospects of the struggle.",day come troop meadow be rush small boy usual front bench find trusty ally trusty enemy other guinea pig wedge sardine form hold canvass prospect struggle 
8,"""The Sixth are going to win in a single innings, if you fellows want to know,"" announced Bramble, with all the authority of one who knows.",sixth go win single inning fellow want know announce authority know 
9,"""Not a bit of it,"" replied Paul.  ""The Fifth are safe to win, I tell you.""",bit reply fifth safe win tell

13,"""Yes.  Look at him there with his arm in a sling.""",look arm sling

16,"""Baynes, they say.  He's no use, though.""",say use 
17,"""Don't you be too cock-sure, you two,"" growled Bramble.  ""I say we shall beat you even if Loman don't play.  Got any brandy-balls left, Greenfield?""",cock sure growl say beat play get brandy ball leave 
18,"Similar speculations and hopes were being exchanged all round the field, and when at last the Fifth went out to field, and Callonby and Wren went in to bat for the Sixth, you might have heard a cat sneeze, so breathless was the excitement.",similar speculation hope exchange field last fifth go field go bat hear cat sneeze breathless excitement 
19,"Amid solemn silence the first few balls were bowled.  The third ball of the first over came straight on to Wren's bat, who played it neatly back to the bowler.  It was not a run, only a simple block; but it was the first play of the match, and so quite enough to loosen the tongues of all the small boys, who yelled, and howled, and cheered as frantically as if a six had been run or a wicket taken.  And the ice once broken, every ball and every hit were marked and applauded as if empires depended on them.",solemn silence first few ball bowl third ball first over come bat play bowler run simple block first play match enough loosen tongue small boy yell howl cheer run wicket take ice break ball hit mark applaud empire depend 
20,"It was in the midst of this gradually rising excitement that Loman slipped quietly and unobserved from the scene, and betook himself to the errand on which we accompanied him in the preceding chapter.",midst rise excitement slip unobserve scene betak errand accompany preced chapter 
21,"The two Sixth men went quickly to work, and at the end of the second over had scored eight.  Then Callonby, in stepping back to ""draw"" one of Wraysford's balls, knocked down his wicket.",sixth man go work end second over score step draw ball knock wicket 
22,How the small boys yelled at this!,small boy yell

25,"""No more do I,"" said Stephen.  ""He always knocks Oliver's bowling about.""",say knock bowling 
26,"""Oh, bother; is your brother bowling?"" said Master Paul, quite unconscious of wounding any one's feelings.  ""It's a pity they've got no one better.""",bother brother bowl say unconscious wound feeling pity get good 
27,"Stephen coloured up at this, and wondered what made Paul such a horrid boy.",coloured wonder make horrid boy 
28,"""Better look-out for your eyes,"" said Bramble, cheerily.  ""The captain always knocks up this way, over square-leg's head.""",good look eye say captain knock way square leg head 
29,"There was a general buzz of youngsters round the field, as the hero of the school walked up to the wicket, and coolly turned to face Oliver's bowling.",be general buzz youngster field hero school walk wicket turn face bowling 
30,"The scorer in the tent hurriedly sharpened his pencil.  The big fellows, who had been standing up to watch the opening overs, sat down on the grass and made themselves comfortable.  Something was going to happen, evidently.  The captain was in, and meant business.",scorer tent sharpen pencil big fellow stand watch open over sit grass make comfortable go happen captain mean business 
31,"Oliver gripped the ball hard in his hand, and walked back to the end of his run.  ""Play!"" cried the umpire, and amid dead silence the ball shot from the bowler's hand.",grip ball hand walk end run play cry umpire dead silence ball shot bowler hand 
32,"Next moment there rose a shout loud enough to deafen all Saint Dominic's.  The ball was flying fifty feet up in the air, and Raleigh was slowly walking, bat in hand, back to the tent he had only a moment ago quitted!",next moment rise shout deaf ball fly foot air walk bat hand tent have moment quit 
33,"The captain had been clean bowled, first ball!",captain clean bowl first ball 
34,"Who shall describe the excitement, the yelling, the cheering, the consternation that followed?  Paul got up and danced a hornpipe on the bench; Bramble kicked the boy nearest to him.  ""Well bowled, sir!"" shouted some.  ""Hard lines!"" screamed others.  ""Hurrah for the Fifth!""",describe excitement yelling cheering consternation follow get dance hornpipe bench kick boy near bowl sir shout hard line scream other fifth 
35,"""You'll beat them yet, Sixth!"" such were a few of the shouts audible above the general clamour.",beat sixth such few shout audible general clamour 
36,"As for Stephen, he was wild with joy.  He was a staunch partisan of the Fifth in any case, but that was nothing to the fact that it was _his_ brother, his own brother and nobody else's, who had bowled that eventful ball, and who was at that moment the hero of Saint Dominic's.  Stephen felt as proud and elated as if he had bowled the ball himself, and could afford to be absolutely patronising to those around him, on the head of this achievement.",wild joy staunch partisan fifth case fact _his_ brother own brother else bowl eventful ball moment hero feel proud elated bowl ball afford patronising head achievement 
37,"""That wasn't a bad ball of Oliver's,"" he said to Paul.  ""He can bowl very well when he tries.""",bad ball say bowl try 
38,"""It was a beastly fluke!"" roared Bramble, determined to see no merit in the exploit.",beastly fluke roar determined see merit exploit 
39,"""Shut up and don't make a row,"" said Stephen, with a bland smile of forgiveness.",shut make row say bland smile forgiveness 
40,"Bramble promised his adversary to shut _him_ up, and after a little more discussion and altercation and jubilation, the excitement subsided, and another man went in.  All this while the Fifth were in ecstasies.  They controlled their feelings, however, contenting themselves with clapping Oliver on the back till he was nearly dead, and speculating on the chances of beating their adversaries in a single innings.",promise adversary shut little more discussion altercation jubilation excitement subside man go fifth ecstasie control feeling content clap back dead speculate chance beat adversary single inning 
41,But they had not won the match yet.,win match 
42,"Winter was next man in, and he and Wren fell to work very speedily in a decidedly business-like way.  No big hits were made, but the score crawled up by ones and twos steadily, and the longer they were at it the steadier they played.  Loud cheers announced the posting of thirty on the signal-board, but still the score went on.  Now it was a slip, now a bye, now a quiet cut.",next man fall work business like way big hit make score crawl one two steady play loud cheer announce posting signal board score go slip bye quiet cut 
43,"""Bravo! well played!"" cried Raleigh and his men frequently.  The captain, by the way, was in excellent spirits, despite his misfortune.",play cry man captain way excellent spirit misfortune 
44,"Thirty-five, forty!  The Fifth began to look hot and puzzled.  The batsmen were evidently far too much at home with the bowling.  A change must be made, even though it be to put on only a second-rate bowler.",fifth begin look hot puzzled batsmen much home bowling change make put second rate bowler 
45,"Tom Senior was put on.  He was nothing like as good a bowler as either Wraysford, or Oliver, or Ricketts.  He bowled a very ordinary slow lob, without either twist or shoot, and was usually knocked about plentifully; and this appeared likely to be his fate now, for Wren got hold of his first ball, and knocked it right over into the scorer's tent for five.  The Fifth groaned, and could have torn the wretched Tom to pieces.  But the next ball was more lucky; Winter hit it, indeed, but he hit it up, sky-high, over the bowler's head, and before it reached the ground Bullinger was safe underneath it.  It was with a sigh of relief that the Fifth saw this awkward partnership broken up.  The score was at forty-eight for three wickets; quite enough too!",put good bowler bowl ordinary slow lob twist shoot knock appear likely fate get hold first ball knock scorer tent fifth groan tear wretch piece next ball lucky hit hit sky high bowler head reach ground safe sigh relief fifth see awkward partnership break score wicket 
46,"After this the innings progressed more evenly.  Men came in and went out more as usual, each contributing his three or four, and one or two their ten or twelve.  Among the latter was Baynes, who, at the last moment, it will be remembered, had been put into the eleven to replace Loman.  By careful play he managed to put together ten, greatly to his own delight, and not a little to the surprise of his friends.",inning progress man come go usual contribute latter last moment remember put replace careful play manage put own delight little surprise friend 
47,"In due time the last wicket of the Sixth fell, to a total of eighty-four runs.",due time last wicket fall total run 
48,"The small boys on the bench had had leisure to abate their ardour by this time.  Bramble had recovered his spirits, and Paul and Stephen looked a little blue as they saw the total signalled.",small boy bench have leisure abate ardour time recover spirit look little blue see total signall 
49,"""Eighty-four's a lot,"" said Stephen.",lot say 
50,Paul nodded glumly.,nod

52,"The two friends listened to these taunts in silent sorrow, and wished the next innings would begin.",friend listen taunt silent sorrow wish next inning begin 
53,"It did presently, and not very brilliantly either.  The Fifth only managed to score fifty-one, and to this total Wraysford was the only player who made anything like good scoring.  Oliver got out for six, Ricketts for nine, and Tom Senior and Braddy both for a ""duck's-egg."" Altogether it was a meagre performance, and things looked very gloomy for the Fifth when, for a second time, their adversaries took the wickets.",fifth manage score total only player make good scoring get duck egg meagre performance thing look gloomy fifth second time adversary take wicket 
54,"Things never turn out at cricket as one expects, however, and the second innings of the Sixth was no exception to the rule.  They only made thirty-six runs.  Stephen and Paul were hoarse with yelling, as first one wicket, then another, went down for scarcely a run.  Raleigh and Baynes seemed the only two who could stand up at all to the bowling of Oliver and Wraysford, but even their efforts could not keep the wickets up for long.",thing turn cricket expect second inning exception rule make run hoarse yell first wicket go run seem only stand bowling effort keep wicket long 
55,"Every one saw now that the final innings would be a desperate struggle. The Fifth wanted sixty-nine to be equal and seventy to win, and the question was, Would they do it in time?",one see final inning desperate struggle fifth want equal win question do time 
56,"Stephen and his confederate felt the weight of this question so oppressive that they left the irritating company of Mr Bramble, and walked off and joined themselves to a group of Fourth Form fellows, who were watching the match with sulky interest, evidently sore that they had none of their men in the School Eleven.",confederate feel weight question oppressive leave irritating company walk join group fourth form fellow watch match sulky interest sore have man 
57,"""They'll never do it, and serve them right!"" said one.  ""Why didn't they put Mansfield in the eleven, or Banks?  They're far more use than Fisher or Braddy.""",do serve say put more use 
58,"""For all that, it'll be a sell if the Sixth lick,"" said another.",sell sixth lick say

60,"""Jolly for the Sixth!"" retorted the other; whereupon Stephen laughed, and had his ears boxed for being cheeky.  The Fourth Senior could not stand ""cheek.""",sixth retort other laugh have ear box cheeky fourth stand cheek 
61,"But Saint Dominic's generally was ""sweet"" on the Fifth, and hoped they would win.  When, therefore, Tom Senior and Bullinger went in first and began to score there was great rejoicing.",sweet fifth hope win go begin score great rejoicing 
62,"But the Fourth Form fellows, among whom Stephen now was, refused to cheer for any one; criticism was more in their line.",fourth form fellow refuse cheer one criticism more line 
63,"""Did you ever see a fellow hit across wickets more horribly than Senior?"" said one.",see fellow hit wicket senior say 
64,"""Just look at that!"" cried another.  ""That Bullinger's a downright muff not to get that last ball to leg!  I could have got it easily.""",look cry downright muff get last ball leg get 
65,"""Well, with that bowling, it's a disgrace if they _don't_ score; that's all I can say,"" remarked a third.",bowling disgrace n't_ score say remark third 
66,"And so these Fourth Form grandees went on, much to Stephen's wrath, who, when Oliver went in, removed somewhere else, so as to be out of ear-shot of any offensive remarks.",fourth form grandee go much wrath go remove else ear shot offensive remark 
67,"Oliver, however, played so well that even the Fourth Form critics could hardly run him down.  He survived all the other wickets of his side, and, though not making a brilliant score, did what was almost as useful--played steadily, and gradually demoralised the bowling of the enemy.",play fourth form critic run survive other wicket side make brilliant score do useful play demoralise bowling enemy 
68,"As the game went on the excitement increased rapidly; and when at length the ninth wicket went down for sixty-one, and the last man in appeared, with nine to win, the eagerness on both sides scarcely knew bounds. Every ball, every piece of fielding, was cheered by one side, and every hit and every piece of play was as vehemently cheered by the other.  If Raleigh and Wren had been nervous bowlers, they would undoubtedly have been disconcerted by the dead silence, followed by terrific applause, amid which every ball--even a wide--was delivered.  But happily they were not.",game go excitement increase length ninth wicket go last man appear win eagerness side know bound ball piece fielding cheer side hit piece play cheer other nervous bowler disconcert dead silence follow terrific applause ball wide deliver 
69,"It was at this critical juncture that Loman reappeared on the scene, much consoled to have the interview with Cripps over, and quite ready now to hear every one lament his absence from the match.",critical juncture reappear scene console have interview ready hear one lament absence match 
70,"The last man in was Webster, a small Fifth boy, who in the last innings had signalised himself by making a duck's-egg.  The Fifth scarcely dared hope he would stay in long enough for the nine runs required to be made, and looked on now almost pale with anxiety.",last man small fifth boy last inning signalise make duck egg fifth dare hope stay run require make look pale anxiety

75,"""Didn't I tell you!"" exclaimed Pembury, delighted; ""he'll save us; he's got down to that end on purpose to take the bowling.  Do you twig, Loamy?  And he'll stick to that end till the last ball of the over, and then he'll run an odd number, and get up to the other end.  Do you comprehend?""",tell exclaim delighted save get end purpose take bowling twig stick end last ball over run odd number get other end comprehend

77,"""Do I, really?"" replied the lame boy; ""how odd that is, now-- particularly without a crib!""",reply lame boy odd crib 
78,"Loman was fast losing patience--a fact which seemed to have anything but a damping effect on the editor of the _Dominican_.  But another hit or two by Oliver created a momentary diversion.  It was quite clear that Pembury's version of Oliver's tactics was a correct one.  He could easily have run three, but preferred to sacrifice a run rather than leave the incompetent and flurried Webster to face the bowling.",fast lose patience fact seem have damp effect editor hit create momentary diversion clear version tactic correct one run prefer sacrifice run leave incompetent flurry face bowling 
79,"""Six to win!"" cried Stephen; ""I'm _certain_ Oliver will do it!""",win cry do 
80,"""Yes, Oliver was always a plodding old blockhead!"" drily observed Pembury, who seemed to enjoy the small boy's indignation whenever any one spoke disrespectfully of his big brother.",plodd old blockhead observe seem enjoy small boy indignation one speak big brother 
81,"""He's not a blockhead!"" retorted Stephen, fiercely.",blockhead retort 
82,"""Go it!  Come and kick my legs, young 'un; there's no one near but Loamy, and he can't hurt.""",go come kick leg young be hurt

85,"Whether Loman would have carried out his threat or not is doubtful, but at that moment a terrific shout greeted another hit by Oliver--the best he had made during the match--for which he ran four.  One to tie, two to win! will they do it?",carry threat doubtful moment terrific shout greet hit good make match run tie win do 
86,It was a critical moment for Saint Dominic's.  Had the two batsmen been playing for their lives they could not have been more anxiously watched; even Pembury became silent.,critical moment batsmen play life watch become silent 
87,And now the last ball of the over is bowled in dead silence.  Onlookers can even hear the whizz with which it leaves Wren's hand.,last ball over bowl dead silence onlooker hear whizz leave hand 
88,"It is almost wide, but Oliver steps out to it and just touches it. Webster is half across the wickets already--ready for a bye.  Oliver calls to him to come on, and runs.  It is a desperate shave--too desperate for good play.  But who cares for that when that run has pulled the two sides level, and when, best of all, Oliver has got up to the proper end for the next over?",wide step touch half wicket ready bye call come run desperate shave desperate good play care run pull side level good get proper end next

93,"Oliver understands it evidently, and, to the joy of the Fifth, plays it. But why does their cheer drop suddenly, and why in a moment is it drowned, over and over and over again, by the cheers of the Sixth and their partisans, as the crowd suddenly breaks into the field, and the ball shoots high up in the air?",understand joy fifth play cheer drop moment drown cheer sixth partisan crowd break field ball shoot high air 
94,"A catch!  Baynes, the odd man, had missed a chance a few overs back from standing too deep.
