2,or The Heart of Stone and the Heart of Gold,
3," The little white Princess always woke in her little white bed when the starlings began to chatter in the pearl gray morning. As soon as the woods were awake, she used to run up the twisting turret-stairs with her little bare feet, and stand on the top of the tower in her white bed-gown, and kiss her hands to the sun and to the woods and to the sleeping town, and say: ""Good morning, pretty world!""",little white wake little white bed starling begin chatter pearl gray morning wood awake use run twist turret stair little bare foot stand top tower white bed gown kiss hand sun wood sleeping town say good morning pretty world 
4,"Then she would run down the cold stone steps and dress herself in her short skirt and her cap and apron, and begin the day's work. She swept the rooms and made the breakfast, she washed the dishes and she scoured the pans, and all this she did because she was a real Princess. For of all who should have served her, only one remained faithful--her old nurse, who had lived with her in the tower all the Princess's life. And, now the nurse was old and feeble, the Princess would not let her work any more, but did all the housework herself, while Nurse sat still and did the sewing, because this was a real Princess with skin like milk and hair like flax and a heart like gold.",run cold stone step dress short skirt cap apron begin day work sweep room make breakfast wash dish scour pan do real serve remain faithful old nurse live tower life nurse old feeble let work more do housework sit do sewing real princess skin milk hair flax heart gold 
5,"Her name was Sabrinetta, and her grandmother was Sabra, who married St. George after he had killed the dragon, and by real rights all the country belonged to her: the woods that stretched away to the mountains, the downs that sloped down to the sea, the pretty fields of corn and maize and rye, the olive orchards and the vineyards, and the little town itself--with its towers and its turrets, its steep roofs and strange windows--that nestled in the hollow between the sea, where the whirlpool was, and the mountains, white with snow and rosy with sunrise.",name grandmother marry kill dragon real right country belong wood stretch mountain down slope sea pretty field corn maize rye olive orchard vineyard little town tower turret steep roof strange window nestle hollow sea whirlpool mountain white snow rosy sunrise 
6,"But when her father and mother had died, leaving her cousin to take care of the kingdom till she grew up, he, being a very evil Prince, took everything away from her, and all the people followed him, and now nothing was left her of all her possessions except the great dragon proof tower that her grandfather, St. George, had built, and of all who should have been her servants only the good nurse.",father mother die leave cousin take care kingdom grow evil take person follow leave possession great dragon proof tower grandfather build servant good nurse 
7,This was why Sabrinetta was the first person in all the land to get a glimpse of the wonder.,first person land get glimpse wonder 
8,"Early, early, early, while all the townspeople were fast asleep, she ran up the turret-steps and looked out over the field, and at the other side of the field there was a green, ferny ditch and a rose-thorny hedge, and then came the wood. And as Sabrinetta stood on her tower she saw a shaking and a twisting of the rose-thorny hedge, and then something very bright and shining wriggled out through it into the ferny ditch and back again. It only came out for a minute, but she saw it quite plainly, and she said to herself: ""Dear me, what a curious, shiny, bright-looking creature! If it were bigger, and if I didn't know that there have been no fabulous monsters for quite a long time now, I should almost think it was a dragon.""",townspeople fast asleep run turret step look field other side field be green ferny ditch rose thorny hedge come wood stand tower see shaking twisting rose thorny hedge bright shine wriggle ferny ditch come minute see say curious shiny bright look creature big know be fabulous monster long time think dragon 
9,"The thing, whatever it was, did look rather like a dragon--but then it was too small; and it looked rather like a lizard--only then it was too big. It was about as long as a hearthrug.",thing look dragon small look lizard big hearthrug 
10,"""I wish it had not been in such a hurry to get back into the wood,"" said Sabrinetta. ""Of course, it's quite safe for me, in my dragonproof tower; but if it is a dragon, it's quite big enough to eat people, and today's the first of May, and the children go out to get flowers in the wood.""",wish hurry get wood say course safe dragonproof tower dragon big eat person today first child go get flower wood 
11,"When Sabrinetta had done the housework (she did not leave so much as a speck of dust anywhere, even in the corneriest corner of the winding stair) she put on her milk white, silky gown with the moon-daisies worked on it, and went up to the top of her tower again.",do housework leave much speck dust corneriest corner wind stair put milk white silky gown moon daisy work go top tower 
12,"Across the fields troops of children were going out to gather the may, and the sound of their laughter and singing came up to the top of the tower.",field troops child go gather sound laughter singing come top tower 
13,"""I do hope it wasn't a dragon,"" said Sabrinetta.",hope dragon say 
14,"The children went by twos and by threes and by tens and by twenties, and the red and blue and yellow and white of their frocks were scattered on the green of the field.",child go two three ten twenties red blue yellow white frock scatter green field 
15,"""It's like a green silk mantle worked with flowers,"" said the Princess, smiling.",green silk mantle work flower say smile 
16,"Then by twos and by threes, by tens and by twenties, the children vanished into the wood, till the mantle of the field was left plain green once more.",two three ten twenties child vanish wood mantle field leave plain green more 
17,"""All the embroidery is unpicked,"" said the Princess, sighing.",embroidery unpicked say sigh 
18,"The sun shone, and the sky was blue, and the fields were quite green, and all the flowers were very bright indeed, because it was May Day.",sun shine sky blue field green flower bright 
19,"Then quite suddenly a cloud passed over the sun, and the silence was broken by shrieks from far off; and, like a many-colored torrent, all the children burst from the wood and rushed, a red and blue and yellow and white wave, across the field, screaming as they ran. Their voices came up to the Princess on her tower, and she heard the words threaded on their screams like beads on sharp needles: ""The dragon, the dragon, the dragon! Open the gates! The dragon is coming! The fiery dragon!""",cloud pass sun silence break shriek many colored torrent child burst wood rush red blue yellow white wave field scream run voice come tower hear word thread scream bead sharp needle dragon dragon dragon open gate dragon come fiery dragon 
20,"And they swept across the field and into the gate of the town, and the Princess heard the gate bang, and the children were out of sight--but on the other side of the field the rose-thorns crackled and smashed in the hedge, and something very large and glaring and horrible trampled the ferns in the ditch for one moment before it hid itself again in the covert of the wood.",sweep field gate town hear gate bang child sight other side field rose thorn crackle smash hedge large glaring horrible trample fern ditch moment hide covert wood 
21,"The Princess went down and told her nurse, and the nurse at once locked the great door of the tower and put the key in her pocket.",go tell nurse nurse lock great door tower put key pocket 
22,"""Let them take care of themselves,"" she said, when the Princess begged to be allowed to go out and help to take care of the children. ""My business is to take care of you, my precious, and I'm going to do it. Old as I am, I can turn a key still.""",let take care say begg allow go help take care child business take care precious go do old turn key 
23,"So Sabrinetta went up again to the top of her tower, and cried whenever she thought of the children and the fiery dragon. For she knew, of course, that the gates of the town were not dragonproof, and that the dragon could just walk in whenever he liked.",go top tower cry think child fiery dragon know course gate town dragonproof dragon walk like 
24,"The children ran straight to the palace, where the Prince was cracking his hunting whip down at the kennels, and told him what had happened.",child run palace crack hunting whip kennel tell happen 
25,"""Good sport,"" said the Prince, and he ordered out his pack of hippopotamuses at once. It was his custom to hunt big game with hippopotamuses, and people would not have minded that so much--but he would swagger about in the streets of the town with his pack yelping and gamboling at his heels, and when he did that, the green-grocer, who had his stall in the marketplace, always regretted it; and the crockery merchant, who spread his wares on the pavement, was ruined for life every time the Prince chose to show off his pack.",good sport say order pack hippopotamuse custom hunt big game hippopotamuse person minded much swagger street town pack yelp gambol heel do green grocer have stall marketplace regret crockery merchant spread ware pavement ruin life time choose show pack 
26,"The Prince rode out of the town with his hippopotamuses trotting and frisking behind him, and people got inside their houses as quickly as they could when they heard the voices of his pack and the blowing of his horn. The pack squeezed through the town gates and off across country to hunt the dragon. Few of you who had not seen a pack of hippopotamuses in full cry will be able to imagine at all what the hunt was like. To begin with, hippopotamuses do not bay like hounds: They grunt like pigs, and their grunt is very big and fierce. Then, of course, no one expects hippopotamuses to jump. They just crash through the hedges and lumber through the standing corn, doing serious injury to the crops, and annoying the farmers very much. All the hippopotamuses had collars with their name and address on, but when the farmers called at the palace to complain of the injury to their standing crops, the Prince always said it served them right for leaving their crops standing about in people's way, and he never paid anything at all.",ride town hippopotamuse trot frisk person get house hear voice pack blowing horn pack squeeze town gate country hunt dragon few see pack hippopotamuse full cry able imagine hunt begin hippopotamuse bay hound grunt pig grunt big fierce course expect hippopotamuse jump crash hedge lumber standing corn do serious injury crop annoy farmer hippopotamuse have collar name address farmer call palace complain injury standing crop say serve leave crop stand person way pay 
27,"So now, when he and his pack went out, several people in the town whispered, ""I wish the dragon would eat him""--which was very wrong of them, no doubt, but then he was such a very nasty Prince.",pack go several person town whisper wish dragon eat wrong doubt nasty 
28,"They hunted by field, and they hunted by wold; they drew the woods blank, and the scent didn't lie on the downs at all. The dragon was shy, and would not show himself.",hunt field hunt wold draw wood blank scent lie down dragon shy show 
29,"But just as the Prince was beginning to think there was no dragon at all, but only a cock and bull, his favourite old hippopotamus gave tongue. The Prince blew his horn and shouted: ""Tally ho! Hark forward! Tantivy!"" and the whole pack charged downhill toward the hollow by the wood. For there, plain to be seen, was the dragon, as big as a barge, glowing like a furnace, and spitting fire and showing his shining teeth.",begin think be dragon cock bull favourite old hippopotamus give tongue blow horn shout hark whole pack charge hollow wood plain see dragon big barge glow furnace spitting fire show shine tooth 
30,"""The hunt is up!"" cried the Prince. And indeed it was. For the dragon--instead of behaving as a quarry should, and running away--ran straight at the pack, and the Prince, on his elephant, had the mortification of seeing his prize pack swallowed up one by one in the twinkling of an eye, by the dragon they had come out to hunt. The dragon swallowed all the hippopotamuses just as a dog swallows bits of meat. It was a shocking sight. Of the whole of the pack that had come out sporting so merrily to the music of the horn, now not even a puppy-hippopotamus was left, and the dragon was looking anxiously around to see if he had forgotten anything.",hunt cry dragon behave quarry run run pack elephant have mortification see prize pack swallow twinkling eye dragon come hunt dragon swallow hippopotamuse dog swallow bit meat shocking sight whole pack come sport music horn puppy hippopotamus leave dragon look see forget 
31,"The Prince slipped off his elephant on the other side and ran into the thickest part of the wood. He hoped the dragon could not break through the bushes there, since they were very strong and close. He went crawling on hands and knees in a most un-Prince-like way, and at last, finding a hollow tree, he crept into it. The wood was very still--no crashing of branches and no smell of burning came to alarm the Prince. He drained the silver hunting bottle slung from his shoulder, and stretched his legs in the hollow tree. He never shed a single tear for his poor tame hippopotamuses who had eaten from his hand and followed him faithfully in all the pleasures of the chase for so many years. For he was a false Prince, with a skin like leather and hair like hearth brushes and a heart like a stone. He never shed a tear, but he just went to sleep.",slip elephant other side run thickest part wood hope dragon break bush strong close go crawl hand knee un like way last find hollow tree creep wood crashing branch smell burning come alarm drain silver hunting bottle sling shoulder stretch leg hollow tree shed single tear poor tame hippopotamuse eat hand follow pleasure chase many year false skin leather hair hearth brush heart stone shed tear go sleep 
32,"When he awoke it was dark. He crept out of the tree and rubbed his eyes. The wood was black about him, but there was a red glow in a dell close by. It was a fire of sticks, and beside it sat a ragged youth with long, yellow hair; all around lay sleeping forms which breathed heavily.",awoke dark creep tree rub eye wood black be red glow dell close fire stick sit ragged youth long yellow hair lay sleeping form breathe

53,"""It might be as well,"" the Prince admitted.",admit

55,"""Half my kingdom,"" said the Prince, ""and my cousin's hand in marriage.""",kingdom say cousin hand marriage 
56,"""Done,"" said the pig keeper. ""Here goes! The dragon grows small at night! He sleeps under the root of this tree. I use him to light my fire with.""",do say pig keeper go dragon grow small night sleep root tree use light fire 
57,"And, sure enough, there under the tree was the dragon on a nest of scorched moss, and he was about as long as your finger.",tree dragon nest scorch moss finger 
58,"""How can I kill him?"" asked the Prince.",kill ask 
59,"""I don't know that you can kill him,"" said Elfin, ""but you can take him away if you've brought anything to put him in. That bottle of yours would do.""",know kill say take bring put bottle do 
60,"So between them they managed, with bits of stick and by singeing their fingers a little, to poke and shove the dragon till they made it creep into the silver hunting bottle, and then the Prince screwed on the top tight.",manage bit stick singe finger little poke shove dragon make creep silver hunting bottle screw top tight 
61,"""Now we've got him,"" said Elfin. ""Let's take him home and put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the bottle, and then he'll be safe enough. Come along--we'll divide up the kingdom tomorrow, and then I shall have some money to buy fine clothes to go courting in.""",get say let take put seal mouth bottle safe come divide kingdom tomorrow have money buy fine clothes go court 
62,But when the wicked Prince made promises he did not make them to keep.,wicked make promise make keep 
63,"""Go on with you! What do you mean?"" he said. ""I found the dragon and I've imprisoned him. I never said a word about courtings or kingdoms.

66,"""Why, you've only got a kingdom (and a dragon), but I've got clean hands (and five and seventy fine black pigs).""",get kingdom dragon get clean hand fine black pig 
67,"So Elfin sat down again by his fire, and the Prince went home and told his Parliament how clever and brave he had been, and though he woke them up on purpose to tell them, they were not angry, but said: ""You are indeed brave and clever."" For they knew what happened to people with whom the Prince was not pleased.",sit fire go tell clever brave wake purpose tell angry say brave clever know happen person pleased 
68,"Then the Prime Minister solemnly put Solomon's seal on the mouth of the bottle, and the bottle was put in the Treasury, which was the strongest building in the town, and was made of solid copper, with walls as thick as Waterloo Bridge.",prime put seal mouth bottle bottle put strong building town make solid copper wall thick 
69,"The bottle was set down among the sacks of gold, and the junior secretary to the junior clerk of the last Lord of the Treasury was appointed to sit up all night with it and see if anything happened. The junior secretary had never seen a dragon, and, what was more, he did not believe the Prince had ever seen a dragon either. The Prince had never been a really truthful boy, and it would have been just like him to bring home a bottle with nothing in it and then to pretend that there was a dragon inside. So the junior secretary did not at all mind being left. They gave him the key, and when everyone in the town had gone back to bed he let in some of the junior secretaries from other Government departments, and they had a jolly game of hide-and-seek among the sacks of gold, and played marbles with the diamonds and rubies and pearls in the big ivory chests.",bottle set sack gold junior secretary junior clerk last appoint sit night see happen junior secretary see dragon more believe see dragon truthful boy bring bottle pretend be dragon junior secretary mind leave give key town go bed let junior secretary other government department have jolly game hide seek sack gold play marble diamond ruby pearl big ivory chest

71,"The bottle sealed with Solomon's seal had swollen to three times its proper size and seemed to be nearly red hot, and the air got warmer and warmer and the bottle bigger and bigger, till all the junior secretaries agreed that the place was too hot to hold them, and out they went, tumbling over each other in their haste, and just as the last got out and locked the door the bottle burst, and out came the dragon, very fiery, and swelling more and more every minute, and he began to eat the sacks of gold and crunch up the pearls and diamonds and rubies as if they were sugar.",bottle seal seal swollen time proper size seem red hot air get warm warm bottle big big junior secretary agree place hot hold go tumble other haste last get lock door bottle burst come dragon fiery swell more minute begin eat sack gold crunch pearl diamond ruby sugar 
72,"By breakfasttime he had devoured the whole of the Prince's treasures, and when the Prince came along the street at about eleven, he met the dragon coming out of the broken door of the Treasury, with molten gold still dripping from his jaws. Then the Prince turned and ran for his life, and as he ran toward the dragonproof tower the little white Princess saw him coming, and she ran down and unlocked the door and let him in, and slammed the dragonproof door in the fiery face of the dragon, who sat down and whined outside, because he wanted the Prince very much indeed.",breakfasttime devoure whole treasure come street meet dragon come broken door molten gold drip jaw turn run life run dragonproof tower little white see come run unlock door let slam dragonproof door fiery face dragon sit whine want 
73,"The Princess took Prince Tiresome into the best room, and laid the cloth, and gave him cream and eggs and white grapes and honey and bread, with many other things, yellow and white and good to eat, and she served him just as kindly as she would have done if he had been anyone else instead of the bad Prince who had taken away her kingdom and kept it for himself--because she was a true Princess and had a heart of gold.",take good room lay cloth give cream egg white grape honey bread many other thing yellow white good eat serve do else bad take kingdom keep true have heart gold

77,"And so it did. And the moment it opened, the Prince pushed the white Princess out of her tower, just as he had pushed her out of her kingdom, and shut the door. For he wanted to have the tower all for himself. And there she was, in the street, and on the other side of the way the dragon was sitting whining, but he did not try to eat her, because--though the old nurse did not know it--dragons cannot eat white Princesses with hearts of gold.",moment open push white tower push kingdom shut door want have tower street other side way dragon sit whine try eat old nurse know dragon eat white princess heart gold 
78,"The Princess could not walk through the streets of the town in her milky-silky gown with the daisies on it, and with no hat and no gloves, so she turned the other way, and ran out across the meadows, toward the wood. She had never been out of her tower before, and the soft grass under her feet felt like grass of Paradise.",walk street town milky silky gown daisy hat glove turn other way run meadow wood tower soft grass foot feel grass
