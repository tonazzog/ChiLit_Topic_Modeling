1,CHAPTER XXVII. THE CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL,children hospital 
2," THE first day his father resumed his work, Diamond went with him as usual. In the afternoon, however, his father, having taken a fare to the neighbourhood, went home, and Diamond drove the cab the rest of the day. It was hard for old Diamond to do all the work, but they could not afford to have another horse. They contrived to save him as much as possible, and fed him well, and he did bravely.",first day father resume work go usual afternoon father take fare neighbourhood go drive cab rest day hard old do work afford have horse contrive save possible feed 
3,"The next morning his father was so much stronger that Diamond thought he might go and ask Mr. Raymond to take him to see Nanny. He found him at home. His servant had grown friendly by this time, and showed him in without any cross-questioning. Mr. Raymond received him with his usual kindness, consented at once, and walked with him to the Hospital, which was close at hand. It was a comfortable old-fashioned house, built in the reign of Queen Anne, and in her day, no doubt, inhabited by rich and fashionable people: now it was a home for poor sick children, who were carefully tended for love’s sake. There are regions in London where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children, whose fathers and mothers are dead, or unable to take care of them.",next morning father strong think go ask take see find home servant grow friendly time show cross-questioning receive usual kindness consent walk close hand comfortable old fashioned house build reign day doubt inhabit rich fashionable person home poor sick child tend love sake be region hospital other street full such child father mother dead unable take care 
4,"When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay, he saw a number of little iron bedsteads, with their heads to the walls, and in every one of them a child, whose face was a story in itself. In some, health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks, and a doubtful brightness in the eyes, just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses. In others there were more of the signs of winter left. Their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds, more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies; but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less, and that if the spring-time had but arrived, it had yet arrived.",follow room child get bad illness grow lay see number little iron bedstead head wall one child face story health begin appear tinge cheek doubtful brightness eye cold dreary winter spring come blushing bud bright crocuse other be more sign winter leave face remind snow keen cut wind more sunshine soft breeze butterfly sign suffering tell suffering less spring time arrive arrive 
5,"Diamond looked all round, but could see no Nanny. He turned to Mr. Raymond with a question in his eyes.",look see nanny turn question eye

12,"“That’s not Nanny,” he said.",say 
13,“It is Nanny. I have seen her many times since you have. Illness makes a great difference.”,see many time have illness make great difference 
14,"“Why, that girl must have been to the back of the north wind!” thought Diamond, but he said nothing, only stared; and as he stared, something of the old Nanny began to dawn through the face of the new Nanny. The old Nanny, though a good girl, and a friendly girl, had been rough, blunt in her speech, and dirty in her person. Her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company, but it had been coarse notwithstanding, partly from the weather, partly from her living amongst low people, and partly from having to defend herself: now it was so sweet, and gentle, and refined, that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother. And Diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before: “Surely it is good to be afflicted;” or something like that. North Wind, somehow or other, must have had to do with her! She had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden.",girl back north wind think say stare stare old begin dawn face new old good girl friendly girl rough blunt speech dirty person face remind back north wind see good company coarse notwithstand weather living low person have defend sweet gentle refined have lady gentleman father mother help think word hear church day good afflict other have do grow rough girl gentle maiden 
15,"Mr. Raymond, however, was not surprised, for he was used to see such lovely changes--something like the change which passes upon the crawling, many-footed creature, when it turns sick and ill, and revives a butterfly, with two wings instead of many feet. Instead of her having to take care of herself, kind hands ministered to her, making her comfortable and sweet and clean, soothing her aching head, and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty; and kind eyes, the stars of the kingdom of heaven, had shone upon her; so that, what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness, that which was coarse in her had melted away, and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that Diamond did not know her. But as he gazed, the best of the old face, all the true and good part of it, that which was Nanny herself, dawned upon him, like the moon coming out of a cloud, until at length, instead of only believing Mr. Raymond that this was she, he saw for himself that it was Nanny indeed--very worn but grown beautiful.",surprise use see such lovely change change pass crawl many footed creature turn sick ill revive butterfly wing many foot have take care kind hand minister make comfortable sweet clean soothing ach head give cooling drink thirsty kind eye star kingdom heaven shine fire fever dew tenderness coarse melt whole face grow refine sweet know gaze good old face true good part dawn moon come cloud length believe see wear grow beautiful 
16,"He went up to her. She smiled. He had heard her laugh, but had never seen her smile before.",go smile hear laugh see smile 
17,"“Nanny, do you know me?” said Diamond.",know say 
18,"She only smiled again, as if the question was amusing.",smile question amusing 
19,"She was not likely to forget him; for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there, she had dreamed of him often, and had talked much about him when delirious. Nor was it much wonder, for he was the only boy except Joe who had ever shown her kindness.",likely forget know get dream talk much delirious wonder only boy show kindness 
20,"Meantime Mr. Raymond was going from bed to bed, talking to the little people. Every one knew him, and every one was eager to have a look, and a smile, and a kind word from him.",go bed bed talk little person one know one eager have look smile kind word 
21,Diamond sat down on a stool at the head of Nanny’s bed. She laid her hand in his. No one else of her old acquaintance had been near her.,sit stool head bed lay hand else old acquaintance 
22,Suddenly a little voice called aloud--,little voice call 
23,“Won’t Mr. Raymond tell us a story?”,tell story 
24,"“Oh, yes, please do! please do!” cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest. For Mr. Raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them, and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them.",do do cry several little voice strong rest habit tell story go see enjoy more other nice thing doctor permit give 
25,"“Very well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I will. What sort of a story shall it be?”",say sort story 
26,"“A true story,” said one little girl.",true story say little girl 
27,"“A fairy tale,” said a little boy.",fairy tale say little boy 
28,"“Well,” said Mr. Raymond, “I suppose, as there is a difference, I may choose. I can’t think of any true story just at this moment, so I will tell you a sort of a fairy one.”",say suppose be difference choose think true story moment tell sort fairy one 
29,"“Oh, jolly!” exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale.",exclaim little boy call fairy tale 
30,"“It came into my head this morning as I got out of bed,” continued Mr. Raymond; “and if it turns out pretty well, I will write it down, and get somebody to print it for me, and then you shall read it when you like.”",come head morning get bed continue turn write get print read like 
31,“Then nobody ever heard it before?” asked one older child.,hear ask old child 
32,"“No, nobody.”",
33,"“Oh!” exclaimed several, thinking it very grand to have the first telling; and I daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it, because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners.",exclaim several think grand have first telling peculiar freshness new story teller listener 
34,"Some were only sitting up and some were lying down, so there could not be the same busy gathering, bustling, and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story; but their faces, and the turning of their heads, and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure, showed that all such preparations were making within them.",sit lie be same busy gathering bustle shift for child prepare hear story face turning head many feeble exclamation expect pleasure show such preparation make 
35,"Mr. Raymond stood in the middle of the room, that he might turn from side to side, and give each a share of seeing him. Diamond kept his place by Nanny’s side, with her hand in his. I do not know how much of Mr. Raymond’s story the smaller children understood; indeed, I don’t quite know how much there was in it to be understood, for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get. But they all listened with apparent satisfaction, and certainly with great attention. Mr. Raymond wrote it down afterwards, and here it is--somewhat altered no doubt, for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them. I cannot myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of The Sleeping Beauty.",stand middle room turn side side give share see keep place side hand know much story small child understand know much be understand story one have take get listen apparent satisfaction great attention write alter doubt good story teller try make story good time tell help think indebted one old story
