2," Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha.",day open eye sit bed call 
3,"""Look at the moor! Look at the moor!""",look moor look moor 
4,"The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind.  The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland.  Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue.  In India skies were hot and blazing; this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece.  The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.",rainstorm end gray mist cloud sweep night wind wind cease brilliant deep blue sky arched moorland have dream sky blue sky hot blaze deep cool blue seem sparkle water lovely bottomless lake high high arched blueness float small cloud snow white fleece reach world moor look blue gloomy purple black awful dreary gray 
5,"""Aye,"" said Martha with a cheerful grin.  ""Th' storm's over for a bit. It does like this at this time o' th' year.  It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.  That's because th' springtime's on its way.  It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'.""",say cheerful grin th' storm bit like time th' year go night pretendin mean come springtime way long way comin

7,"""Eh! no!"" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes.  ""Nowt o' th' soart!""",say sit heel black lead brush 
8,"""What does that mean?"" asked Mary seriously.  In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not surprised when Martha used words she did not know.",mean ask native speak different dialect few person understand surprise use word know 
9,Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.,laugh do first morning 
10,"""There now,"" she said.  ""I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means 'nothin'-of-the-sort,'"" slowly and carefully, ""but it takes so long to say it.  Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny.  I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a bit.  Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'. You'll want to get out on it as sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickon does."" ""Could I ever get there?"" asked Mary wistfully, looking through her window at the far-off blue.  It was so new and big and wonderful and such a heavenly color.",say talk broad say mean sort take say sunniest place earth sunny tell like moor bit wait see gold colored gorse blossom blossom broom purple bell hundred butterfly bee skylark soarin singin want get sunrise live day get ask look window blue new big wonderful heavenly color 
11,"""I don't know,"" answered Martha.  ""Tha's never used tha' legs since tha' was born, it seems to me.  Tha' couldn't walk five mile.  It's five mile to our cottage.""",know answer use tha' leg bear seem walk mile mile cottage 
12,"""I should like to see your cottage.""",like see cottage 
13,Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again.  She was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it.  It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she wanted something very much.,stare moment take polish brush begin rub grate think small plain face look sour moment do first morning see look trifle little want 
14,"""I'll ask my mother about it,"" she said.  ""She's one o' them that nearly always sees a way to do things.  It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home.  Eh! I am glad.  Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps she could talk to her.""",ask mother say see way do thing day today go glad think lot o' mother talk

18,"""No, tha' hasn't,"" replied Martha.",reply 
19,"She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the back of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite positively.",sit heel rub end nose back hand puzzle moment end 
20,"""Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' goodnatured an' clean that no one could help likin' her whether they'd seen her or not.  When I'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I'm crossin' the moor.""",sensible hard workin' goodnature clean help likin see go day jump joy crossin moor 
21,"""I like Dickon,"" added Mary.  ""And I've never seen him.""",like add see 
22,"""Well,"" said Martha stoutly, ""I've told thee that th' very birds likes him an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.  I wonder,"" staring at her reflectively, ""what Dickon would think of thee?""",say tell bird like th' rabbit wild sheep pony that fox wonder stare think 
23,"""He wouldn't like me,"" said Mary in her stiff, cold little way.  ""No one does.""",like say stiff cold little way 
24,Martha looked reflective again.,look reflective 
25,"""How does tha' like thysel'?"" she inquired, really quite as if she were curious to know.",thysel inquire curious know 
26,Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.,hesitate moment think 
27,"""Not at all--really,"" she answered.  ""But I never thought of that before.""",answer think 
28,Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.,grin little homely recollection 
29,"""Mother said that to me once,"" she said.  ""She was at her wash-tub an' I was in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on me an' says: 'Tha' young vixen, tha'! There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one.  How does tha' like thysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute.""",mother say say wash tub bad temper talkin' ill folk turn say young vixen stand tha like one tha like one thysel make laugh bring sense minute 
30,"She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast.  She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.",go high spirit give breakfast go walk mile moor cottage go help mother washing do week baking enjoy 
31,"Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house.  She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times.  She counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits.  The sunshine made the whole place look different.  The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about.  She went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners.  The change in the weather seemed to have done him good.  He spoke to her of his own accord.  ""Springtime's comin,'"" he said. ""Cannot tha' smell it?""",feel lonely know house go garden possible first thing do run fountain flower garden time count time finish feel good spirit sunshine make whole place look different high deep blue sky arched moor keep lift face look try imagine lie little snow white cloud float go first kitchen garden find work other gardener change weather seem do good speak own accord comin say smell

33,"""I smell something nice and fresh and damp,"" she said.",smell nice fresh damp say 
34,"""That's th' good rich earth,"" he answered, digging away.  ""It's in a good humor makin' ready to grow things.  It's glad when plantin' time comes.  It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do.  In th' flower gardens out there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark.  Th' sun's warmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit.""",good rich earth answer digg good humor makin' ready grow thing glad plantin' time come dull winter get do flower garden thing stirrin' dark sun warmin' see bit green spike stickin black earth bit

37,"""No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,"" said Mary.  ""And I think things grow up in a night.""",hot wet green rain say think thing grow night 
38,"""These won't grow up in a night,"" said Weatherstaff.  ""Tha'll have to wait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spike more there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that.  You watch 'em.""",grow night say have wait poke bit high push spike uncurl leaf day watch 
39,"""I am going to,"" answered Mary.",go answer 
40,"Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knew at once that the robin had come again.  He was very pert and lively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.",hear soft rustle flight wing know robin come pert lively hopp foot put head side look ask question 
41,"""Do you think he remembers me?"" she said.",think remember say 
42,"""Remembers thee!"" said Weatherstaff indignantly.  ""He knows every cabbage stump in th' gardens, let alone th' people.  He's never seen a little wench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee. Tha's no need to try to hide anything from him.""",remember say know cabbage stump garden let alone person see little wench bend findin need try hide 
43,"""Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he lives?"" Mary inquired.",thing stir dark garden live inquire 
44,"""What garden?"" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.",garden grunt become 
45,"""The one where the old rose-trees are."" She could not help asking, because she wanted so much to know.  ""Are all the flowers dead, or do some of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?""",one old rose tree help ask want much know flower dead come summer be rose 
46,"""Ask him,"" said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the robin.  ""He's the only one as knows.  No one else has seen inside it for ten year'.""",ask say hunch shoulder robin only one know else see year 
47,"Ten years was a long time, Mary thought.  She had been born ten years ago.",year long time think bear year 
48,"She walked away, slowly thinking.  She had begun to like the garden just as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. She was beginning to like Martha, too.  That seemed a good many people to like--when you were not used to liking.  She thought of the robin as one of the people.  She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.",walk think begin like garden begin like robin mother begin like seem good many person like use like think robin person go walk long ivy cover wall see tree top second time walk interesting exciting thing happen robin 
49,"She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare flower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending to peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followed her.  But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled her with delight that she almost trembled a little.",hear chirp twitter look bare flower bed left side hopping pretend peck thing earth persuade follow know follow surprise fill delight tremble little 
50,"""You do remember me!"" she cried out.  ""You do! You are prettier than anything else in the world!""",remember cry pretty else world 
51,"She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail and twittered.  It was as if he were talking.  His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be.  Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.",chirp talk coax hopp flirt tail twitter talk red waistcoat satin puff tiny breast fine grand pretty show important human person robin mistress forget contrary life allow draw close close bend talk try make robin sound 
52,Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as that! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand toward him or startle him in the least tiniest way.  He knew it because he was a real person--only nicer than any other person in the world. She was so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.,think let come know world make put hand startle least tiniest way know real person nice other person world happy dare breathe 
53,"The flower-bed was not quite bare.  It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth.  He stopped on it to look for a worm.  The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.",flower bed bare bare flower perennial plant cut winter rest be tall shrub low one grow back bed robin hopp see hop small pile turn earth stop look worm earth turn dog try dig mole scratch deep hole 
54,"Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as she looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It was something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.",look know hole look see bury turn soil ring rusty iron brass robin fly tree put hand pick ring more ring old key look bury long time 
55,Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face as it hung from her finger.,mistress stand look frighten face hang finger 
56,"""Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,"" she said in a whisper. ""Perhaps it is the key to the garden!""",bury year say whisper key garden
