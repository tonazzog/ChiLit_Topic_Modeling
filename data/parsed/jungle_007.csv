3,"It had been raining heavily for one whole month--raining on a camp of thirty thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, and mules all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the Viceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan--a wild king of a very wild country. The Amir had brought with him for a bodyguard eight hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp or a locomotive before in their lives--savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their heel ropes and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or the camels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the tents, and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep. My tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe. But one night a man popped his head in and shouted, “Get out, quick! They’re coming! My tent’s gone!”",rain whole month rain camp man thousand camel elephant horse bullock mule gather place call review receive visit wild king wild country bring bodyguard man horse see camp locomotive life savage man savage horse back central night mob horse sure break heel rope stampede camp mud dark camel break run fall rope tent imagine pleasant man try go sleep tent lay camel line think safe night man pop head shout get quick come tent gone 
4,"I knew who “they” were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the other side; and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance about like a mad ghost. A camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry as I was, I could not help laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not know how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of sight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud.",know put boot waterproof scuttle slush little fox terrier go other side be roaring grunting bubbling see tent cave pole snap begin dance mad ghost camel blunder wet angry help laugh run know many camel get loose sight camp plow way mud 
5,"At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was somewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at night. As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might be.",last fall tail end gun know artillery line stack night want plowter more drizzle dark put waterproof muzzle gun make sort wigwam rammer find lay tail gun wonder get 
6,"Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes to use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.",get ready go sleep hear jingle harness grunt mule pass shake wet ear belong screw gun battery hear rattle strap ring chain thing saddle pad screw gun tiny little make piece screw time come use take mountain mule find road useful fight rocky country 
7,"Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching and slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen’s.

8,"He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to the mule, “What shall I do? Where shall I go?

11,"The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down whimpering.

20,"I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky white bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won’t go any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for “Billy.”",hear chain drag ground yoke great sulky white bullock drag heavy siege gun elephant go fire come shoulder step chain battery mule call

34,"“Now, don’t be angry after you’ve been afraid. That’s the worst kind of cowardice,” said the troop-horse. “Anybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night, I think, if they see things they don’t understand. We’ve broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our head-ropes.”",angry afraid bad kind cowardice say troop horse forgive scared night think see thing understand break picket new recruit get tell tale whip snake home scared death loose end head rope

How can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of course that’s life and death to you. Get round with your hind legs under you the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you haven’t room to swing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs.

40,"“That depends,” said the troop-horse. “Generally I have to go in among a lot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than the farrier’s knives--and I have to take care that Dick’s boot is just touching the next man’s boot without crushing it. I can see Dick’s lance to the right of my right eye, and I know I’m safe.

45,"“H’m!” said Billy. “It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things at any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and creep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge where there’s just room enough for your hoofs.

I wish I could show you our business. It’s beautiful. Why, it took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. The science of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because, if you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep hidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your way.
