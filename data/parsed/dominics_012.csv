2,"The afternoon of the famous ""indignation meeting"" in the Fourth Junior was the afternoon of the week which Mr Cripps the younger, putting aside for a season the anxieties and responsibilities of his ""public"" duties in Maltby, usually devoted to the pursuit of the ""gentle craft,"" at his worthy father's cottage by Gusset Weir.  Loman, who was aware of this circumstance, and on whose spirit that restless top joint had continued to prey ever since the evening of the misadventure a week ago, determined to avail himself of the opportunity of returning the unlucky fishing-rod into the hands from which he had received it.",afternoon famous indignation meeting fourth afternoon week young put season anxiety responsibility public duty devote pursuit gentle craft worthy father cottage aware circumstance spirit restless top joint continue prey evening misadventure week determined avail opportunity return unlucky fishing rod hand receive 
3,"He therefore instructed Stephen to take it up to the lock-house with a note to the effect that having changed his mind in the matter since speaking to Cripps, he found he should not require the rod, and therefore returned it, with many thanks for Mr Cripps's trouble.",instruct take lock house note effect change mind matter speak find require rod return many thanks trouble 
4,"Stephen, little suspecting the questionable nature of his errand, undertook the commission, and duly delivered both rod and letter into the hands of Mr Cripps, who greatly astonished him by swearing very violently at the contents of the letter.  ""Well,"" said he, when he had exhausted his vocabulary (not a small one) of expletives--""well, of all the grinning jackanapeses, this is the coolest go!  Do you take me for a fool?""",little suspect questionable nature errand undertake commission deliver rod letter hand astonished swear content letter say exhaust vocabulary small one expletive grinn jackanapese coolest go take fool 
5,"Stephen, to whom this question appeared to be directly applied, disclaimed any idea of the kind, and added, ""I don't know what you mean.""",question appear apply disclaim idea kind add know mean 
6,"""Don't you, my young master?  All right!  Tell Mr Loman I'll wait upon him one fine day, see if I don't!  Here's me, given up a whole blessed day to serve him, and a pot of money out of my pocket, and here he goes! not a penny for my pains!  Chucks the thing back on my 'ands as cool as a coocumber, all because he's changed his mind.  I'll let him have a bit of my mind, tell him, Mr Gentleman Schoolboy, see if I don't.  I ain't a-going to be robbed, no! not by all the blessed monkeys that ever wrote on slates!  _I'll_ wait upon him, see if I don't!""",young master right tell wait fine day see give whole bless day serve pot money pocket go penny pain chuck thing and cool coocumber change mind let have bit mind tell see go rob bless monkey write slate wait see 
7,"Stephen, to whom the whole of this oration, which was garnished with words that we can hardly set down in print, or degrade ourselves by suggesting, was about as intelligible as if it had been Hebrew, thought it better to make no reply, and sorrowed inwardly to find that such a nice man as Mr Cripps should possess so short a temper.  But the landlord of the Cockchafer soon recovered from his temporary annoyance, and even proceeded to apologise to Stephen for the warmth of his language.",whole oration garnish word set print degrade suggest intelligible think good make reply sorrow find nice man possess short temper landlord recover temporary annoyance proceed apologise warmth language 
8,"""You'll excuse me, young gentleman,"" said he, ""but I'm a plain-spoken man, and I was--there, I won't deny it--I was a bit put out about this here rod first go off.  You'll excuse me--of course I don't mean no offence to you or Mister Loman neither, who's one of the nicest young gentlemen I ever met.  Of course if you'd a' paid seventy bob out of your own pocket it would give _you_ a turn; leastways, if you was a struggling, honest working man, like me.""",excuse young gentleman say plain speak man deny bit put rod go excuse course mean offence nice young gentleman meet course pay bob own pocket give turn leastway struggle honest working man 
9,"""That's it,"" snivelled, old Mr Cripps, who had entered during this last speech; ""that's it, Benny, my boy, honest Partisans, that's what we is, who knows what it are to be in want of a shillin' to buy a clo' or two for the little childer.""",snivell old enter last speech boy honest partisan know want shillin buy clo little childer 
10,"What particular little ""childer"" Mr Cripps senior and his son were specially interested in no one knew, for neither of them was blessed with any.  However, it was one of old Mr Cripps's heart-moving phrases, and no one was rude enough to ask questions.",particular little childer senior son interested know bless old heart move phrase rude ask question 
11,"Stephen did not, on the present occasion, feel moved to respond to the old man's lament, and Cripps junior, with more adroitness than filial affection, hustled the old gentleman out of the door.",present occasion feel move respond old man lament junior more adroitness filial affection hustle old gentleman door 
12,"""Never mind him,"" said he to Stephen.  ""He's a silly old man, and always pretends he's starvin'.  If you believe me, he's a thousand pounds stowed away somewheres.  I on'y wish,"" added he, with a sigh, ""he'd give me a taste of it, for its 'ard, up-'ill work makin' ends meet, particular when a man's deceived by parties.  No matter.  I'll pull through; you see!""",mind say silly old man pretend starvin believe pound stow wish add sigh give taste ard up ill work makin' end meet particular man deceive party matter pull see

14,"""Oh, Mr Cripps, how much is that bat?""",much bat 
15,"""Bat!  Bless me if I hadn't nearly forgot all about it.  Ain't it a beauty, now?""",bat bless forget beauty 
16,"""Yes, pretty well,"" said Stephen, whose friends had one and all abused the bat, and who was himself a little disappointed in his expectations.",say friend have abuse bat little disappointed expectation 
17,"""Pretty well!  I like that.  You must be a funny cricketer, young gentleman, to call that bat only pretty well.  I suppose you want me to take _that_ back, too?"" and here Mr Cripps looked very fierce.",like funny cricketer young gentleman call bat suppose want take _that_ look fierce 
18,"""Oh, no,"" said Stephen, hurriedly.  ""I only want to know what I am to pay for it.""",say want know pay 
19,"""Oh, come now, we needn't mind about that.  That'll keep, you know.  As if I wanted the money.  Ha, ha!""",come need mind keep know want money 
20,"Even a green boy like Stephen could not fail to wonder why, if Mr Cripps was as hard up as he had just described himself, he should now be so anxious to represent himself as not in want of money.",green boy fail wonder hard describe anxious represent want money 
21,"""Please, I want to know the price.""",want know price 
22,"""As if I was a-going to name prices to a young gentleman like you! Please yourself about it.  I shall not be disappointed if you gives me only eighteenpence, and if _you_ thinks twelve bob is handsome, well, let it be.  _I_ can struggle on somehow.""",go name price young gentleman disappoint give eighteenpence think bob handsome let struggle 
23,"This was uncomfortable for Stephen, who, too green, fortunately, to comprehend the drift of Mr Cripps's gentle hints, again asked that he would name a price.",uncomfortable green comprehend drift gentle hint ask name price 
24,This time Mr Cripps answered more precisely.,time answer 
25,"""Well, that there bat is worth a guinea, if you want to know, but I'll say a sovereign for cash down.""",bat worth guinea want know say sovereign cash

That'll do, and if you don't like it--well, the governor shall know about it!""",know have second hand bat know come young gentleman poor man fool find have nonsense suppose have do wait jackanapese mate error do like governor know 
31,"Stephen was dreadfully uncomfortable.  Though, to his knowledge, he had done nothing wrong, he felt terribly guilty at the bare notion of the Doctor being informed of his transactions with Mr Cripps, besides greatly in awe of the vague threats held out by that gentleman.  He did not venture on further argument, but, bidding a hasty farewell, returned as fast as he could to Saint Dominic's, wondering whatever Oliver would say, and sorely repenting the day when first he was tempted to think of the unlucky bat.",uncomfortable knowledge do wrong feel guilty bare notion inform transaction awe vague threat hold gentleman venture further argument bid hasty farewell return wonder say repent day tempt think unlucky bat 
32,"He made a clean breast of it to his brother that evening, who, of course, called him an ass, and everything else complimentary, and was deservedly angry.  However, Stephen had reason to consider himself lucky to possess an elder brother at the school who had a little more shrewdness than himself.  Oliver was determined the debt should be paid at once, without even waiting to write home, and by borrowing ten shillings from Wraysford, and adding to it the residue of his own pocket-money, the sovereign was raised and dispatched that very night to Mr Cripps; after which Oliver commanded his brother to sit down and write a full confession of his folly home, and ask for the money, promising never to make such a fool of himself again.  This task the small boy, with much shame and trembling at heart, accomplished; and in due time an answer came from his mother which not only relieved his mind but paid off his debts to Oliver and Wraysford, and once for all closed the business of the treble-cane splice bat.",make clean breast brother evening course call ass else complimentary angry have reason consider lucky possess elder brother school have little more shrewdness determine debt pay wait write home borrowing shilling add residue own pocket money sovereign raise dispatch very night command brother sit write full confession folly home ask money promise make fool task small boy much shame tremble heart accomplish due time answer come mother relieve mind pay debt close business treble cane splice bat 
33,It would have been well for Loman if he could have got out of his difficulties as easily and as satisfactorily.,get difficulty 
34,"Ever since he had gathered from Stephen Mr Cripps's wrath on receiving the returned rod, he had been haunted by a dread lest the landlord of the Cockchafer should march up to Saint Dominic's, and possibly make an exposure of the unhappy business before the Doctor and the whole school. He therefore, after long hesitation and misgiving, determined himself to call at the Cockchafer, and try in some way to settle matters.  One thing reassured him.  If Cripps had discovered the crack or the fracture in the rod, he would have heard of it long before now; and if he had not, then the longer the time the less chance was there of the damage being laid at his door.  So he let three weeks elapse, and then went to Maltby.  The Cockchafer was a small, unpretentious tavern, frequented chiefly by carriers and tradesmen, and, I regret to say, not wholly unknown to some of the boys of Saint Dominic's, who were foolish enough to persuade themselves that skittles, and billiards, and beer were luxuries worth the risk incurred by breaking one of the rules of the school.  No boy was permitted to enter any place of refreshment except a confectioner's in Maltby under the penalty of a severe punishment, which might, in a bad case, mean expulsion.  Loman, therefore, a monitor and a Sixth Form boy, had to take more than ordinary precautions to reach the Cockchafer unobserved, which he succeeded in doing, and to his satisfaction--as well as to his trepidation--found Mr Cripps the younger at home.",gather wrath receive return rod haunt dread landlord march make exposure unhappy business whole school long hesitation misgiving determine call try way settle matter thing reassure discover crack fracture rod hear time less chance damage lay door let week elapse go small unpretentious tavern frequent carrier tradesmen regret say unknown boy foolish persuade billiards beer luxury worth risk incur break rule school boy permit enter place refreshment confectioner penalty severe punishment bad case mean expulsion monitor sixth form boy have take more ordinary precaution reach unobserve succeed do satisfaction trepidation find young home 
35,"""Ho, he! my young shaver,"" was that worthy's greeting, ""here you are at last.""",young shaver worthy greeting last 
36,"This was not encouraging to begin with.  It sounded very much as if Mr Cripps had been looking forward to this visit.  However, Loman put as bold a face as he could on to it, and replied, ""Hullo, Cripps, how are you?  It's a long time since I saw you; jolly day, isn't it?""",encouraging begin sound look visit put bold face reply long time see jolly day 
37,"""Jolly!"" replied Mr Cripps, looking very gloomy, and drawing a glass of beer for the young gentleman before he ordered it.  Loman did not like it at all.  There was something about Cripps's manner that made him feel very uncomfortable.",reply look gloomy draw glass beer young gentleman order like be manner make feel uncomfortable 
38,"""Oh, Cripps,"" he presently began, in as off-hand a manner as he could assume under the depressing circumstances--""Oh, Cripps, about that rod, by the way.  I hope you didn't mind my sending it back.  The fact is,"" (and here followed a lie which till that moment had not been in the speaker's mind to tell)--""the fact is, I find I'm to get a present of a rod this summer at home, or else of course I would have kept it.""",begin hand manner assume depressing circumstance rod way hope mind send fact follow lie moment speaker mind tell fact find get present rod summer home else course keep

40,"""I hope you got it back all right,"" continued Loman, who felt as if he must say something.  ""They are such fragile things, you know.  I thought I'd just leave it in the bag and not touch it, but send it straight back, for fear it should be damaged.""",hope get continue feel say such fragile thing know think leave bag touch send fear damage

44,"""The fact is,"" he began again, speaking for the sake of speaking, and not even knowing what he was going to say--""the fact is--"" Here the street door opened, and there entered hurriedly a boy whom Loman, to his confusion and consternation, recognised as Simon of the Fifth, the author of the ""Love-Ballad.""

He beckoned Loman into the inner parlour, whither the boy tremblingly followed, leaving Simon to finish his glass of ""the usual"" undisturbed.",worthy see game come own hand slow take advantage beckon inner parlour boy follow leave finish glass usual undisturbed 
53,"I need not repeat the painful conversation that ensued between the sharper and the wretched boy.  It was no use for the latter to deny or explain.  He was at the mercy of the man, and poor mercy it was. Cripps, with many oaths and threats, explained to Loman that he could, if he chose, have him up before a magistrate for fraud, and that he would do so for a very little.  Loman might choose for himself between a complete exposure, involving his disgrace for life, or paying the price of the rod down and 20 besides, and he might consider himself lucky more was not demanded.",repeat painful conversation ensue sharper wretched boy use latter deny explain mercy man poor mercy many oath threat explain choose have magistrate fraud do little choose complete exposure involve disgrace life pay price rod consider lucky more demand

Now there's a friend of mine I can introduce you to, who's just wanting to put a twenty on the horse, if he can find any one to take it.
