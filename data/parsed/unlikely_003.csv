3,"Tony was born in the town of Antioch. This is not the same Antioch that you read about in history, but quite a different place. It was a place where nearly every one was very dark as to the complexion, and rather short as to the temper and figure. People who were fair in the face and easy in the temper were not thought much of in Antioch. When Tony’s mother saw that her baby was as fair as a daffodil and as good as gold, and laughed all day, she said, “Oh dear, oh dear, I suppose he takes after his grandfather, he is not in the least like _my_ family,” and the matter annoyed her so much that she died.",bear town same read history different place place one dark complexion short temper figure person fair face easy temper think much mother see baby fair daffodil good gold laugh day say suppose take grandfather least family matter annoy much die

5,"The people of Antioch were always fighting the neighbouring tribes, red-faced savages who deserved no better fate than to be killed, only, of course, sometimes a few Antiochians had to be killed too, because that is part of the game, and if there were no danger there would be no glory, would there?",person fight neighbour tribe red face savage deserve good fate kill course few have kill part game be danger be glory 
6,"Little Tony’s hair remained yellow, and his habit of laughing grew with his years, and he learned his lessons and he learned his play. He was excellent company, and if it had not been for the yellowness of his hair and the gentleness of his nature, he would have been quite popular among his schoolmates.",little hair remain yellow habit laugh grow year learn lesson learn play excellent company yellowness hair gentleness nature popular schoolmate 
7,"His grandfather called him “gentle,” but the people of Antioch called him “lazy,” for they, as I said, were very black, and generally angry. They scurried up and down in their rocky little city, and always they seemed to be driven by most urgent affairs, hurrying to keep important appointments. They ran about all day long, attending to their business, and hardly stopping even for their dinner or their tea, and no one ever saw any of them asleep.",grandfather call gentle person call lazy say black angry scurry rocky little city seem drive most urgent affair hurry keep important appointment run day attend business stop dinner tea see asleep

12,"The King of Antioch was always in a hurry, always running somewhere or other, consequently he was seldom on his throne, and his loyal subjects had to look out very sharply, for he was always sure to be where they least expected him. You may think that they could have got over this little difficulty by always looking for the King where they least expected him, but if you try this simple experiment for yourself with your governess or tutor, or even your nurse, I think you will find that it is not so easy as it looks.",hurry run other throne loyal subject have look sure least expect think get little difficulty look least expect try simple experiment governess tutor nurse think find easy look

15,"The King rustled quickly round the little house, and looked at everything—dresser, chairs, plates and pots. He was sorry that there was nothing that he could find fault with, so he said, “Beware of Luxury,” and hurried off to make his presence felt in some other humble home. There was no pride about King Anthony XXIII. He just dropped in without an invitation and took his subjects as he found them.",rustle little house look dresser chair plate pot sorry be find fault say hurry make presence feel other humble home be pride drop invitation take subject find

19,"It was a strange town, all up-hill and down-hill, with steep rocks and precipices all mixed up with the public streets. The people, for all their busy habits, had no trade, or rather they did not manufacture anything. They built houses, and brought up their families. They wrapped their children up very snugly and carried them about at an earlier age than we consider safe, and they milked their cows, which were large and green and had wings, and they drank the milk, and they gathered the fruit of the trees that grew on the plain below the town, and they got on very well indeed. There was only one drawback to life in Antioch, and that was its uncertainty. At any moment an earthquake might occur, then down would go half the town, and the busy citizens had it all to build again. They soon did it, for they were nothing if not industrious. A much more awful thing was the storm of hot rain that now and then fell on the town, a blighting rain that killed all it touched. This was more dreaded than even the earthquakes, but fortunately it very seldom happened.",strange town hill hill steep rock precipice mix public street person busy habit have trade manufacture build house bring family wrap child carry early age consider safe milk cow large green have wing drink milk gather fruit tree grow plain town get be drawback life uncertainty moment earthquake occur go town busy citizen have build do industrious awful thing storm hot rain fall town blight rain kill touch dread earthquake happen 
20,"Old Tony was beadle and sexton and keeper of the town records; and very nicely he kept them too. There was not a speck of dirt on one of them. He used to spend hours and hours polishing the records, and he scoured the tombstones till they shone again; and he had most of the inscriptions by heart. After an earthquake he was always most careful to put the tombstones back in their proper places, and one day, when he was doing this, he came on a stone he did not remember to have seen before. He called to young Tony, who had had a Board School education, to see if he could read the bits of words that were carved upon it.",old beadle sexton keeper town record keep be speck dirt use spend hour hour polish record scour tombstone shine have most inscription heart earthquake careful put tombstone proper place day do come stone remember see call young have board school education see read bit word carve

A magician he was by trade, but no one thought much of him, except perhaps the King, and _he_ never gave him a lift. He used to do things with eggs and a hat. He broke the eggs as often as not.

Towards the end he grew very feeble—hardly prophesied a single prophecy from one year’s end to another. Sometimes he would say, ‘I should not wonder if it rained before Sunday,’ but then he never wondered at anything. He was a calm old man, was poor Henry.

31,"Young Tony tried to interest his boy friends in the back of poor old Henry Birkbeck’s tombstone, but nobody cared. They were all in too much of a hurry to care for an occupation so slow as cleaning tombstones, but Tony worked away perseveringly. He cleaned it with soap, and he cleaned it with soda, with brickdust and vinegar, with rotten stone and washleather, with patience and elbow grease, and the last two, as you know, will clean almost anything. So after a time a few letters began to show distinctly here and there, and presently Tony found he could read whole words.",young try interest boy friend back poor old tombstone care much hurry care occupation slow clean tombstone work clean soap clean soda brickdust vinegar rotten stone washleather patience elbow grease last know clean time few letter begin show find read whole word

71,"“Take him to the Parliament House,” said the King, beside himself with rage. “Give him a taste of the Mace,” and Tony tasted the Mace and was stamped on by the Great Seal, who was very fierce and lived in a cage at the Parliament House, until he was stiff and sore and sorry enough to be glad to say that his name was anything the King liked, except Tony, which of course it never, never could have been. He admitted at last that his name was William Waterbury Watchett, and was discharged with a caution.",take say rage give taste taste stamp great fierce live cage stiff sore sorry glad say name like course admit last name discharge caution

74,"Young Tony thought a good deal about poor Henry Birkbeck’s prophecy. Perhaps the Great Seal had stamped it on his memory. Anyway he could not forget it, and all the next day he was wandering about on the steep edge of the town, looking out over the landscape below. It was not an interesting landscape. All round the brown hill where the town was lay the vast forests of green trees, something like bamboos, whose fruit the people ate; and beyond that one could see the beginnings of a still larger forest, where none of the people of Antioch had ever dared to go—the forest, whose leaves were a hundred times as big as the King himself, and the trunks of the trees as big as whole countries. Above all was the blue sky—but, look as Tony would, he could see no blue mountain.",young think good deal poor prophecy great stamp memory forget next day wonder steep edge town look landscape interesting landscape brown hill town lay vast forest green tree bamboo fruit person eat see beginning large forest person dare go forest leave time big trunk tree big whole country blue sky look see blue mountain

76,"“It must be an earthquake,” said Tony, trembling, but he did not run away. And his valour was rewarded as valour deserves to be. The next moment the vast branches of the enormous forest parted, and a giant figure came out into the forest of bamboo-like trees. It was a figure more gigantic than Tony had ever imagined possible. It had long yellow hair. In its hand it carried a great white bowl, big enough to float a navy in. If such an expression did not sound rather silly, I should say that this figure gave Tony the idea of a little-girl-giant. It sat down among the bamboo forest, crushing millions of trees as it sat. With a spoon twice the length of the King’s banqueting hall, it began to eat out of the tremendous basin. Tony saw great lumps, like blocks of soft marble, balanced on the vast spoon, and he knew that the giant-little-girl was eating giant-bread-and-milk. And she wore a giant frock, and the frock was blue. Then Tony understood. This was the “Blue Mountain,” and in that big big sea of a basin there was milk—the Blue Mountain’s milk.",earthquake say tremble run valour reward valour deserve next moment vast branch enormous forest part giant figure come forest bamboo tree figure gigantic imagine possible have long yellow hair hand carry great white bowl big float navy expression sound silly say figure give idea little girl giant sit bamboo forest crush million tree sit spoon length banqueting hall begin eat tremendous basin see great lump block soft marble balance vast spoon know giant little girl eat giant bread milk wear giant frock frock blue understand blue big big sea basin be milk blue milk 
77,"Tony stood still for a moment, then turned and ran as hard as he could straight into the Royal presence. To be more exact, he ran into the Royal waistcoat, for the King, in a hurry, as usual, was coming out of his palace gates with a rush. The King was extremely annoyed. He refused to listen to a word Tony had to say until Parliament had been called together, and had passed a Bill strengthening the enactments against cheek. Then he allowed Tony to tell his tale. And when the tale was told every one ran to the battlements of the town to look. There was no blue mountain to be seen.",stand moment turn run royal presence exact run royal waistcoat hurry usual come palace gate rush annoyed refuse listen word have say call pass strengthen enactment cheek allow tell tale tale tell one run battlement town look be blue mountain see

81,"“I should think it was,” said the King; “if there is any mountain, which I don’t for a moment believe, you had better go and fetch me some of the milk (not that I think there is any) out of the mountain’s basin (which I cannot believe exists outside of your imagination). If you bring it to this address you will be suitably rewarded.”",think say be mountain moment believe have good go fetch milk think be mountain basin believe exist imagination bring address reward

86,"He passed through the crowded streets, where every one was rushing about in the usual frantic haste, and out at the town gates, and down the road into the forest. The trunks of the trees towered tall and straight above, and a subdued green light shone all about him.",pass crowded street one rush usual frantic haste town gate road forest trunk tree tower tall subdued green light shine 
87,"The ground was very broken and uneven, and often Tony had to go a long way round to avoid some great rock or chasm. But he travelled fast, for he was a quick walker, and he did not miss the way once, although, of course, it was quite a strange country to him.",ground broken uneven have go long way avoid great rock chasm travel quick walker miss way course strange country 
88,"There had been evening classes at his school to teach the boys the art of finding their way in strange places, and Tony had attended all the lectures and taken notice as well as notes. And now he was able to practise what he had learned, and he was glad he had not wasted his time in drawing pictures of the masters, or playing nibs with the boys next him, and throwing ink pellets at more studious boys.",be evening class school teach boy art find way strange place attend lecture take notice note able practise learn glad waste time draw picture master play nib boy throw ink pellet studious boy 
89,"But the journey was longer than he expected, and the mug was rather in his way. He was very much afraid of breaking that mug: it is an awkward thing to break a mug with “A present for a good King” on it. It is so difficult to replace. There are very few of those mugs made nowadays. There is little or no demand for them.",journey long expect mug way afraid break mug awkward thing break mug present good difficult replace be few mug make be little demand 
90,"But at last the green light of the forest began to grow brighter, and Tony saw that he was approaching a sort of clearing among the trees, so he put his best foot foremost, without stopping to think which was his worst foot—always a mistake when you are tired and footsore.",last green light forest begin grow bright see approach sort clear tree put good foot stop think bad foot mistake tired footsore 
91,"And now he came out from under the tall branches, and saw a round open space in the forest, where millions of fallen trees lay on the ground. And he knew that this was the spot where the mountain had sat down to eat its unimaginable enormous breakfast. But there was no mountain to be seen, and Tony knew that he could do nothing but sit down and wait, in the hope that the Blue Mountain would come next morning to eat its breakfast in the same place.",come tall branch see round open space forest million fall tree lay ground know spot mountain sit eat unimaginable enormous breakfast be mountain see know do sit wait hope blue come next morning eat breakfast same place

93,"And next morning there was a rustling and a swaying of the trees, and the Blue Mountain came striding over the tall tree-tops, bending down the forest as she came on colossal black legs and massive shoes with monstrous ankle straps. Each shoe was big enough to have crushed a hundred Tonys at one step. So he hid in his cave, and presently knew by the shaking of the ground, like an earthquake, that the mountain had sat down.",next morning be rustling sway tree blue come strid tall tree top bending forest come colossal black leg massive shoe monstrous ankle strap shoe big crush step hide cave know shaking ground earthquake mountain sit 
94,"Then he came out. He was too near to see the mountain properly, but he saw a great blue-fold of giant frock near him, and far above him towered the blue heights of the giant-little-girl’s knees. On the summit of these shone a vast white round—the great bread-and-milk basin.",come near see mountain see great blue fold giant frock tower blue height giant little girl knee summit shine vast white round great bread milk basin 
95,"Tony started to climb the blue-fold. It was stiff, starched—with giant starch, I suppose—and it bore his weight easily. But it was a long climb, and he drew a deep breath of thankfulness when he reached the broad table-land of the giant-little-girl’s knees—and now the smooth china roundness of the big basin was before him. He tried its polished surface again and again, and always fell back baffled. Then he saw that he might climb up the sleeve of the gigantic arm whose hand held the basin. With his heart in his mouth he began the ascent, slowly and carefully, holding the precious mug closely to his breast. His breath came faster and faster as he went up and up, and at last stood triumphantly on the edge of the great blue sleeve. From there to the edge of the basin it was easy to crawl, and now at last he stood on the giddy verge of the monstrous basin, and looked down at the lake of milk with the rocks of bread in it, many feet below. The great height made him giddy. He lost his footing, and still clasping the mug, he fell headlong into the giant-bread-and-milk. The bread rocks were fortunately soft. Tony picked himself up. He was wet, but no bones were broken, and the mug—oh, joy! the mug was safe. Tony looked it over anxiously as he sat on a rock, a sloppy and uncertain resting place. There was only one small crack near the handle, and Tony was almost sure that that had been there before.",start climb blue fold stiff starch giant starch suppose bear weight long climb draw deep breath thankfulness reach broad table land giant little girl knee smooth china roundness big basin try polished surface fall baffle see climb sleeve gigantic arm hand hold basin heart mouth begin ascent hold precious mug breast breath come fast fast go last stand edge great blue sleeve edge basin easy crawl last stand giddy verge monstrous basin look lake milk rock bread many foot great height make giddy lose footing clasp mug fall giant bread milk bread rock soft pick wet bone break mug joy mug safe look sit rock sloppy uncertain resting place be small crack handle sure 
96,"“I don’t know however I shall get out again,” said Tony; “perhaps I never shall, but in case I do, I suppose I had better fill the mug”; so he stooped from the rocks and filled the mug from the lake of milk, which was much thicker than the milk of the green cows with wings, the only milk Tony was used to. He had just filled the mug and tied it down with a piece of parchment which he had taken from the Town Records and brought with him for the purpose, when a noise like thunder suddenly broke on his ear. And indeed it very nearly broke the ear itself, and so startled Tony that the precious mug all but slipped from his grasp. Then a wave of milk swept up almost over his head. The whole of the massive basin was moved sideways. Then came a shock like an earthquake. The basin was being set on the ground. Tony felt that the Blue Mountain had seen him and had screamed. What would the giant-little-girl do? Would she kill him? If so, how?",know get say case suppose have good fill mug stoop rock fill mug lake milk thick milk green cow wing only milk use fill mug tie piece parchment take bring purpose noise thunder break ear break ear startle precious mug slip grasp wave milk sweep head whole massive basin move come shock earthquake basin set ground feel blue see scream giant little girl do kill 
97,These questions afforded Tony food for some interesting reflections during the next few moments.,question afford food interesting reflection next few moment 
98,"He looked round him for a way of escape. Everywhere towered the smooth white walls. The tremendous spoon which he had seen the Blue Mountain use had, unfortunately, not been left in the basin, or he could have climbed out by that. He gave himself up for lost. Then suddenly he saw the trunk of a slender tree appear at the edge of the basin. It was pushed down towards him. Yes on to the very bread-rock on which he crouched. Would it crush him? No! The end of it rested on the rock by his side; it gently moved towards him. He saw now that the Blue Mountain was not cruel. She was not bent on destroying him. She was offering him a way of escape. He eagerly climbed the tree. When he was half-way up, however, the giant-little-girl flung the tree aside, and with Tony still clinging to it, it fell crashing into the forest. When he came to himself he almost shouted for joy to find the mug still whole.",look way escape tower smooth white wall tremendous spoon see blue use leave basin climb give lose see trunk slender tree appear edge basin push very bread rock crouch crush end rest rock side move see blue cruel bent destroy offer way escape climb tree half giant little girl flung tree cling fall crash forest come shout joy find mug whole

106,"“_Reward!_” said the King, who had been looking at the mug, “_reward!_ when you have cracked my mug—my own only mug, with ‘A present for a good King’ on it. Reward indeed! a stamp from the Great Seal would be more——”",reward say look mug _reward crack mug own only mug present good reward stamp great

108,"“Dear grandson,” it said, “the King has found out that my name was entered in the register as Anthony Antrobus, and he refuses to believe that the alteration to Sydney Cecil Ernest Watchett was made at my birth. So I am seeking safety at a distance. I have only one piece of advice to give you. _Do so too._—Your loving Grandfather.”",dear grandson say find name enter register refuse believe alteration make birth seek safety distance have piece advice give loving grandfather 
109,"This seemed such good advice to Tony, whose name was also in the register, that he was just going to take it when the door was flung open, and in rushed the King and the Army. They hustled and bustled and rustled round the house, breaking and tearing everything, and when there was nothing more to spoil they carried Tony off to prison.",seem such good advice name register go take door flung open rush hustle bustle rustle house break tear be more spoil carry prison 
110,"“So this is my reward for getting the milk for him,” said poor Tony to himself, as he sat in prison, loaded with chains, and waiting for his trial. “I wish I had drunk the milk myself. This is what comes of loyalty.

111,"Acting on this resolution next day, at his trial, Tony said so, and what is more, he came very near indeed to hanging for it. For King Anthony XXIII. was furious. He absolutely danced with rage, and it took six Prime Ministers to restrain his emotion while the trial went on. Tony was tried for an attempt to murder the King. The whole thing, said the Public Persecutor, was nothing but a plot. The prophecy of Henry Birkbeck, which nobody had seen, till Tony found it; the Blue Mountain, which nobody but Tony had seen at all; the thick milk so mysteriously obtained, all pointed to dark treason and villainy. The crack in the mug was a peculiarly incriminating circumstance. (I cannot help the long words—Public Persecutors will use them.) It was a vile plot, the Persecutor said, but it had failed. The Public Analyst gave evidence that the milk was not milk at all, but some explosive substance too dangerous to analyse.",acting resolution next day trial say more come hang furious dance rage take prime restrain emotion trial go try attempt murder whole thing say public plot prophecy see find blue see thick milk obtain point dark treason villainy crack mug incriminating circumstance help long word public persecutor use vile plot say fail public give evidence milk milk explosive substance dangerous analyse

For every one was too astonished to stop him.",poison milk cry seize mug milk bring court give evidence lift lip prevent drain milk last drop run court one astonished stop 
126,"The moment he was outside, he felt a sudden and awful change in himself. He was growing, growing, growing. He hurried out of the town. He felt that it would soon be too small to hold him. Outside he got bigger and bigger till the trees of the nearer forest were like grass under his feet, and the mug ran out of his hand like a little grain of rape-seed. And there beside him stood the Mountain—a little girl in a blue dress—and he was taller than she was.",moment feel sudden awful change grow grow grow hurry town feel small hold get big big tree nearer forest grass foot mug run hand little grain rape seed stand little girl blue dress tall
