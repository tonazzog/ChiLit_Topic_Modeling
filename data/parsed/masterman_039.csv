1,CHAPTER 39.,
2,"The next morning, as there was no particular work on hand, Ready and Mr Seagrave took the lines to add to the stock of the fish-pond.  As the weather was fine and cool, William accompanied them, that he might have the benefit of the fresh air.  As they passed the garden, they observed that the seeds sown had already sprung up an inch or two above the ground, and that, apparently none of them had missed.  While Ready and Mr Seagrave were fishing, and William sitting near them, William said to his father--",next morning be particular work hand ready take line add stock fish pond weather fine cool accompany have benefit fresh air pass garden observe seed sow spring inch ground miss ready fishing sit say father 
3,"""Many of the islands near us are inhabited; are they not, papa?""",many island inhabit papa 
4,"""Yes, but not those very near us, I believe.  At all events, I never heard any voyagers mention having seen inhabitants on the isles near which we suppose the one we are on to be.""",believe event hear voyager mention see inhabitant isle suppose one 
5,"""What sort of people are the islanders in these seas?""",sort person islander sea 
6,"""They are various.  The New Zealanders are the most advanced in civilisation.  The natives of Van Diemen's Land and Australia are some portions of them of a very degraded class--indeed, little better than the beasts of the field.""",various new advanced civilisation native portion degrade class little good beast field 
7,"""I have seen them,"" said Ready; ""and I think I can mention a people, not very numerous indeed, who are still more like the beasts of the field. I saw them once; and, at first, thought they were animals, and not human beings.""",see say ready think mention person numerous beast field see first think animal human being 
8,"""Indeed, Ready; where may that be?""",ready 
9,"""In the Great Andaman Isles, at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal.  I once anchored in distress in Port Cornwallis, and the morning after we anchored, we saw some black things going upon all fours under the trees that came down to the water's edge.  We got the telescope, and perceived then that they were men and women, for they stood upright.""",great mouth anchore distress morning anchore see black thing go four tree come water edge get telescope perceive man woman stand 
10,"""Did you ever come into contact with them?""",come contact 
11,"""No, sir, I did not; but I met, at Calcutta, a soldier who had; for at one time the East India Company intended making a settlement on the island, and sent some troops there.  He said that they caught two of them; that they were not more than four feet high, excessively stupid and shy; they had no houses or huts to live in, and all that they did was to pile up some bushes to keep the wind off.""",sir meet soldier have time intend make settlement island send troops say catch more foot high stupid shy have house hut live do pile bush keep wind 
12,"""Had they any arms?""",have arm 
13,"""Yes, sir, they had bows and arrows; but so miserably made, and so small, that they could not kill anything but very small birds.""",sir have bow arrow make small kill small bird 
14,"""Where did the people come from who inhabited these islands, papa?""",person come inhabit island papa 
15,"""That is difficult to say, William; but it is supposed that they have become inhabited in much the same way as this our island has been--that is, by people in canoes or boats driven out to sea, and saving their lives by effecting a landing, as we have done.""",difficult say suppose become inhabit same way island person canoe boat drive sea save life effect landing do 
16,"""I believe that's the truth,"" replied Ready; ""I heard say that the Andaman Isles were supposed to have been first inhabited by a slaver full of negroes, who were wrecked on the coast in a typhoon.""",believe truth reply ready hear say suppose inhabit slaver full negroe wreck coast typhoon 
17,"""What is a typhoon, Ready?""",typhoon ready 
18,"""It is much the same as a hurricane, William; it comes on in India at the change of the monsoons.""",same hurricane come change monsoon 
19,"""But what are monsoons?""",monsoon 
20,"""Winds that blow regular from one quarter so many months during the year, and then change round and blow from another just as long.""",wind blow regular quarter many month year change blow 
21,"""And what are the trade-winds, which I heard poor Captain Osborn talking about after we left Madeira?""",trade wind hear poor talk leave 
22,"""The trade-winds blow on the equator, and several degrees north and south of it, from the east to the west, following the course of the sun.""",trade wind blow equator several degree east west follow course sun 
23,"""Is it the sun which produces these winds?""",sun produce wind 
24,"""Yes, the extreme heat of the sun between the tropics rarefies the air as the earth turns round, and the trade-winds are produced by the rushing in of the less heated air.""",extreme heat sun tropic rarefy air earth turn trade wind produce rush heat air 
25,"""Yes, William; and the trade-winds produce what they call the Gulf Stream,"" observed Ready.",trade wind produce call observe ready 
26,"""How is that?  I have heard it spoken of, papa.""",hear speak papa 
27,"""The winds, constantly following the sun across the Atlantic Ocean, and blowing from east to west, have great effect upon the sea, which is forced up into the Gulf of Mexico (where it is stopped by the shores of America), so that it is many feet higher in the Gulf than in the eastern part of the Atlantic.  This accumulation of water must of course find a vent somewhere, and it does in what is called the Gulf Stream, by which the waters are poured out, running very strong to the northward, along the shores of America, and then [westward] eastward, passing not far from Newfoundland, until its strength is spent somewhere to the northward of the Azores.""",wind follow sun atlantic blow west have great effect sea force stop shore many foot high gulf eastern part accumulation water course find vent call water pour run strong northward shore pass strength spend northward 
28,"""The Gulf Stream, William,"" said Ready, ""is always several degrees warmer than the sea in general, which is, they say, owing to its waters remaining in the Gulf of Mexico so long, where the heat of the sun is so great.""",say ready several degree warm sea general say ow water remain heat sun great 
29,"""What do you mean by the land and sea breezes in the West Indies, and other hot climates, papa?""",mean land sea breeze other hot climate papa 
30,"""It is the wind first blowing off from the shore, and then blowing from the sea towards the shore, during certain hours of the day, which it does regularly every twenty-four hours.  This is also the effect of the heat of the sun.  The sea breeze commences in the morning, and in the afternoon it dies away, when the land breeze commences, which lasts till midnight.""",wind blow shore blow sea shore certain hour day do hour effect heat sun sea breeze commence morning afternoon die land breeze commence last midnight 
31,"""There are latitudes close to the trade-winds,"" said Ready, ""where the wind is not certain, where ships have been becalmed for weeks; the crews have exhausted the water on board, and they have suffered dreadfully. We call them the Horse latitudes--why, I do not know.  But it is time for us to leave off, and for Master William to go into the house.""",be latitude close trade wind say ready wind certain ship becalm week crew exhaust water board suffer call horse latitude know time leave go house 
32,"They returned home, and after supper Ready went on with his narrative.",return supper ready go narrative 
33,"""I left off at the time that I was sent on board of the man-of-war, and I was put down on the books as a supernumerary boy.  I was on board of her for nearly four years, and we were sent about from port to port, and from clime to clime, until I grew a strong, tall lad, and was put into the mizen-top.  I found it very comfortable.  I did my duty, and the consequence was, I never was punished; for a man may serve on board of a man-of-war without fear of being punished, if he only does his duty, and the duty is not very hard either; not like on board of the merchant vessels, where there are so few hands--there it is hard work.  Of course, there are some captains who command men-of-war who are harsh and severe; but it was my good fortune to be with a very mild and steady captain, who was very sorry when he was obliged to punish the men, although he would not overlook any improper conduct.  The only thing which was a source of constant unhappiness to me was, that I could not get to England again, and see my mother.  I had written two or three letters, but never had an answer; and at last I became so impatient that I determined to run away the very first opportunity which might offer. We were then stationed in the West Indies, and I had very often consultations with Hastings on the subject, for he was quite as anxious to get away as I was; and we had agreed that we would start off together the very first opportunity.  At last we anchored in Port Royal, Jamaica, and there was a large convoy of West India ships, laden with sugar, about to sail immediately.  We knew that if we could get on board of one, they would secrete us until the time of sailing, for they were short-handed enough, the men-of-war having pressed every man they could lay their hands upon.  There was but one chance, and that was by swimming on board of one of the vessels during the night-time, and that was easy enough, as they were anchored not a hundred yards from our own ship.  What we were afraid of was the sharks, which were so plentiful in the harbour.  However, the night before the convoy was to sail we made up our minds that we would run the risk, for we were so impatient to escape that we did not care for anything.  It was in the middle watch--I recollect it, and shall recollect it all my life, as if it were last night--that we lowered ourselves down very softly from the bows of the ship, and as soon as we were in the water we struck out for one of the West Indiamen close to us.  The sentry at the gangway saw the light in the water made by our swimming through it, and he hailed, of course; we gave no answer, but swam as fast as we could; for after he had hailed we heard a bustle, and we knew that the officer of the watch was manning a boat to send after us.  I had just caught hold of the cable of the West Indiaman, and was about to climb up by it, for I was a few yards before Hastings, when I heard a loud shriek, and, turning round, perceived a shark plunging down with Hastings in his jaws.  I was so frightened, that for a short time I could not move: at last I recovered myself, and began to climb up by the cable as fast as I could.  I was just in time, for another shark made a rush at me; and although I was clear out of the water more than two feet, he sprung up and just caught my shoe by the heel, which he took down with him.  Fear gave me strength, and in a second or two afterwards I was up at the hawse-holes, and the men on board, who had been looking over the bows, and had witnessed poor Hastings' death, helped me on board, and hurried me down below, for the boat from our ship was now nearly alongside.  When the officer of the boat came on board, they told him they had perceived us both in the water, close to their vessel, and that the sharks had taken us down.  As the shriek of Hastings was heard by the people in the boat, the officer believed that it was the case, and returned to the ship.  I heard the drum beat to quarters on board of the man-of-war, that they might ascertain who were the two men who had attempted to swim away, and a few minutes afterwards they beat the retreat, having put down D.D. against my name on the books, as well as against that of poor Hastings.""",leave time send board man war put book supernumerary boy board year send port port clime clime grow strong tall lad put mizen top find comfortable do duty consequence punish man serve board man war fear punish do duty duty hard board merchant vessel be few hand hard work course be captain command man war harsh severe good fortune mild steady captain sorry oblige punish man overlook improper conduct only thing source constant unhappiness get see mother write letter have answer last become impatient determine run very first opportunity offer station have consultation subject anxious get agree start very first opportunity last anchore be large convoy ship laden sugar sail know get board secrete time sailing short handed man war press man lay hand be chance swim board vessel night time easy anchore yard own ship afraid shark plentiful harbour night convoy sail make mind run risk impatient escape care middle watch recollect recollect life last night lower bow ship water strike close sentry gangway see light water make swim hail course give answer swim hail hear bustle know officer watch man boat send catch hold cable about climb few yard hear loud shriek turn perceive shark plung jaw frighten short time move last recover begin climb cable time shark make rush clear water more foot spring catch shoe heel take fear give strength second hawse hole man board look bow witness poor death help board hurry boat ship officer boat come board tell perceive water close vessel shark take shriek hear person boat officer believe case return ship hear drum beat quarter board man war ascertain man attempt swim few minute beat retreat put name book poor

35,"""D stands for discharged from the service; D.D. stands for dead,"" replied Ready; ""and it was only through the mercy of Providence that I was not so.""",stand discharge service stand dead reply ready mercy 
36,"""It was a miraculous escape indeed,"" observed Mr Seagrave.",miraculous escape observe 
37,"""Yes, indeed, sir; I can hardly describe my sensations for some hours afterwards.  I tried to sleep, but could not--I was in agony.  The moment I slumbered, I thought the shark had hold of me, and I would start up and shriek; and then I said my prayers and tried to go to sleep again, but it was of no use.  The captain of the West Indiaman was afraid that my shrieks would be heard, and he sent me down a tumbler of rum to drink off; this composed me, and at last I fell into a sound sleep.  When I awoke, I found that the ship was under weigh and with all canvas set, surrounded by more than a hundred other vessels; the men-of-war who took charge of the convoy, firing guns and making signals incessantly.  It was a glorious sight, and we were bound for Old England.  I felt so happy, that I thought I would risk the jaws of another shark to have regained my liberty, and the chance of being once more on shore in my own country, and able to go to Newcastle and see my poor mother.""",sir describe sensation hour try sleep agony moment slumber think shark have hold start shriek say prayer try go sleep use captain afraid shriek hear send tumbler rum drink compose last fall sound sleep awoke find ship weigh canvas set surround more other vessel man war take charge convoy fire gun make signal glorious sight bind old feel happy think risk jaw shark regain liberty chance shore own country able go see poor mother 
38,"""I am afraid that your miraculous escape did you very little good, Ready,"" observed Mrs Seagrave, ""if you got over it so soon.""",afraid miraculous escape little good ready observe get 
39,"""Indeed, madam, it was not so; that was only the feeling which the first sight of the vessels under weigh for England produced upon me.  I can honestly say that I was a better and more serious person.  The very next night, when I was in my hammock, I prayed very fervently; and there happened to be a very good old Scotchman on board, the second mate, who talked very seriously to me, and pointed out how wonderful had been my preservation, and I felt it.  It was he who first read the Bible with me, and made me understand it, and, I may say, become fond of it.  I did my duty on our passage home as a seaman before the mast, and the captain was pleased with me.  The ship I was in was bound to Glasgow, and we parted company with the convoy at North Foreland, and arrived safe in port.  The captain took me to the owners, who paid me fifteen guineas for my services during the voyage home; and as soon as I received the money, I set off for Newcastle as fast as I could.  I had taken a place on the outside of the coach, and I entered into conversation with a gentleman who sat next to me.  I soon found out that he belonged to Newcastle, and I first inquired if Mr Masterman, the ship-builder, was still alive.  He told me that he had been dead about three months.  `And to whom did he leave his money?'  I asked, `for he was very rich, and had no kin.'  `He had no relations,' replied the gentleman, `and he left all his money to build an hospital and almshouses.  He had a partner in his business latterly, and he left the yard and all the stores to him, I believe, because he did not know whom to leave it to.  There was a lad whom I knew for certain he intended to have adopted and to have made his heir--a lad of the name of Ready; but he ran away to sea, and has never been heard of since.  It is supposed that he was lost in a prize, for he was traced so far.  Foolish boy that he was.  He might now have been a man of fortune.'",madam feeling first sight vessel weigh produce say good serious person next night hammock pray happen good old scotchman board second mate talk point wonderful preservation feel read make understand say become fond do duty passage home seaman mast captain pleased ship bind part company convoy arrive safe port captain take owner pay guinea service voyage home receive money set take place outside coach enter conversation gentleman sit find belong inquire ship builder alive tell dead month leave money ask rich have kin have relation reply gentleman leave money build hospital almshouse have partner business leave yard store believe know leave be lad know certain intend adopt make heir lad name ready run sea hear suppose lose prize trace foolish boy man fortune 
40,"""`Very foolish indeed,' replied I.",foolish reply 
41,"""`Yes; but he has harmed more than himself.  His poor mother, who doted upon him, as soon as she heard that he was lost, pined away by degrees, and--'",harm more poor mother dote hear lose pine degree 
42,"""`You don't mean to say that she is dead?' interrupted I, seizing the gentleman by the arm.",mean say dead interrupt seize gentleman arm 
43,"""`Yes,' replied he, looking at me with surprise; `she died last year of a broken heart.'",reply look surprise die last year break heart 
44,"""I fell back on the luggage behind me, and should have fallen off the coach if the gentleman had not held me.  He called to the coachman to pull up the horses, and they took me down, and put me inside; and as the coach rolled on, I cried as if my heart would break.""",fall luggage fall coach gentleman hold call coachman pull horse take put coach roll cry heart break

46,"""Thank you, sir, it will be better; for I feel my old eyes dim with tears, even now.  It's a dreadful thing in after-life to reflect upon, that your foolish conduct has hastened the death of a most kind mother; but so it was, William, and I give you the truth for your advantage.""",thank good feel old eye dim tear dreadful thing life reflect foolish conduct hasten death kind mother give truth advantage
