2," Hugh John was holding his court under the weeping-elm, and was being visited in detail by his army. The Carters had come over, and, after a vigorous engagement and pursuit, he had even forgiven Sammy for his lack of hardihood in not resisting to the death at the great battle of the Black Sheds.",hold court weeping elm visit detail army come vigorous engagement pursuit forgive lack hardihood resist death great battle black

9,"The review was over. In the safe quiet of the elm-tree shelter General Napoleon might have been seen taking his well-earned repose. He was surrounded by his entire following--except, of course, the two Generals of Division, who were engaged in sweeping out the stable-yard. But these were considered socially supernumerary at any rate, except (a somewhat important exception) when there was fighting to be done.",review safe quiet elm tree shelter see take earn repose surround entire follow course division engage sweep stable yard consider supernumerary rate important exception be fighting do

18,"""And I d'livered Donald!"" contributed Toady Lion complacently.",d'liver contribute 
19,"""Oh, _that_ ain't anything,"" sneered Sammy Carter, who was not in a good humour. His tone roused General Napoleon, who had the strong family feelings of all the Buonapartes.",sneer good humour tone rouse have strong family feeling 
20,"""Shut up, Sammy, or I'll come and kick you. None of us did anything except Toady Lion. You ran away, and I got taken prisoner. Toady Lion is the only man among us!""",shut come kick do run take prisoner only man

22,"Sammy Carter evidently had a sharp retort ready on the tip of his tongue, but he knew well the price he would have to pay for uttering it. Hugh John's eye was upon him, his right hand was closing on a bigger turnip--so Sammy forbore. But he kicked his feet more discontentedly than ever into the turf.",have sharp retort ready tip tongue know price have pay utter eye right hand close big turnip forbore kick foot turf

27,"""Who's touching your father?"" the latter said, a little more soothingly. ""See here, Sammy, you've got your coat on wrong side out to-day. Go home and sleep on it. 'Tisn't my fault if you did run away, and got home before your sister--with a blue place on your back.""",touch father latter say little see get coat wrong side day go sleep fault run get sister blue place back 
28,"Sammy Carter flung out from under the shelter of the elm and went in search of Prissy, from whom in all his moods he was sure of comfort and understanding. He was a somewhat delicate boy, and generally speaking hated quarrelling as much as she did; but he had a clever tongue, which often brought him into trouble, and, like most other humorists, he did not at all relish a jest at his own expense.",flung shelter elm go search mood sure comfort understanding delicate boy speak hate quarrell much have clever tongue bring trouble most other humorist relish jest own expense

36,"For a moment Hugh John was paralysed. He tried to pooh-pooh the matter, but he could not but admit that it might very well be true; so he instantly despatched Toady Lion for Prissy, who, as we know, was the fleetest runner of them all. Upon her reporting for duty, the General sent her to bring back word if the state of affairs was as reported.",moment paralyse try pooh pooh matter admit true despatch know fleetest runner reporting duty send bring word state affair report 
37,"It was. A large red flag was flying, with the inscription in white upon it, ""Down with Smith!"" while above the inscription there was what looked like a rude attempt at a death's head and crossbones. Hugh John knew this ensign in a moment. Once upon a time, in his wild youth, he had served under it as a pirate on the high seas; but of this he now uttered no word.",large red flag fly inscription white inscription look rude attempt death head crossbone know ensign moment time wild youth serve pirate high sea utter word
