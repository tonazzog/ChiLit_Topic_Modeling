13,"“I do believe she does it on purpose!” whispered Ethel to herself, wriggling fearfully on the wide window-seat on which she had precipitated herself, and kicking at the bar of the table, by which manifestation she of course succeeded in deferring her hopes, by a reproof which caused her to draw herself into a rigid, melancholy attitude, a sort of penance of decorum, but a rapid motion of the eyelids, a tendency to crack the joints of the fingers, and an unquietness at the ends of her shoes, betraying the restlessness of the digits therein contained.",believe do purpose whisper wriggle wide window seat precipitate kick bar table manifestation course succeed deferr hope reproof cause draw rigid melancholy attitude sort penance decorum rapid motion eyelid tendency crack joint finger unquietness end shoe betray restlessness digit contain 
14,"It was such a room as is often to be found in old country town houses, the two large windows looking out on a broad old-fashioned street, through heavy framework, and panes of glass scratched with various names and initials. The walls were painted blue, the skirting almost a third of the height, and so wide at the top as to form a narrow shelf. The fireplace, constructed in the days when fires were made to give as little heat as possible, was ornamented with blue and white Dutch tiles bearing marvellous representations of Scripture history, and was protected by a very tall green guard; the chairs were much of the same date, solid and heavy, the seats in faded carpet-work, but there was a sprinkling of lesser ones and of stools; a piano; a globe; a large table in the middle of the room, with three desks on it; a small one, and a light cane chair by each window; and loaded book-cases. Flora began, “If you don’t want this afternoon to yourself--”",room find old country town house large window look broad old fashioned street heavy framework pane glass scratch various name initial wall paint blue skirting third height wide top form narrow shelf fireplace construct day fire make give little heat possible ornament blue white dutch tile bear marvellous representation history protect tall green guard chair much same date solid heavy seat fade carpet work be sprinkling less one stool piano globe large table middle room desk small one light cane chair window load book case begin want afternoon

36,"“It is unlucky,” began the governess, but stopped at the incursion of some new-comers, nearly tumbling over each other, Ethel at the head of them. “Oh, Harry!” as the gathers of her frock gave way in the rude grasp of a twelve-year-old boy. “Miss Winter, ‘tis all right--Mr. Ernescliffe says he is quite up to the walk, and will like it very much, and he will undertake to defend you from the quarrymen.”",unlucky begin governess stop incursion new comer tumble other head gather frock give way rude grasp year old boy right say walk like undertake defend quarrymen

40,"Miss Winter glanced unutterable things at Margaret, and Ethel began to perceive she had done something wrong. Flora was going to speak, when Margaret, trying to appear unconscious of a certain deepening colour in her own cheeks, pressed a hand on her shoulder, and whispering, “I’ll see about it. Don’t say any more, please,” glided out of the room.",glance unutterable thing begin perceive do wrong go speak try appear unconscious certain deepening colour own cheek press hand shoulder whisper see say more glide room

45,"“I think so, since we are so nearly collected,” said Miss Winter; and Ethel, seating herself on the corner of the window-seat, with one leg doubled under her, took up a Shakespeare, holding it close to her eyes, and her brother Norman, who, in age, came between her and Flora, kneeling on one knee on the window-seat, and supporting himself with one arm against the shutter, leaned over her, reading it too, disregarding a tumultuous skirmish going on in that division of the family collectively termed “the boys,” namely, Harry, Mary, and Tom, until Tom was suddenly pushed down, and tumbled over into Ethel’s lap, thereby upsetting her and Norman together, and there was a general downfall, and a loud scream, “The sphynx!”",think collect say seating corner window seat leg double take hold eye brother age come kneel knee window seat support arm shutter learn read disregard tumultuous skirmish go division family term boy push tumble lap upsetting be general downfall loud scream sphynx

53,"Here entered, with a baby in her arms, a lady with a beautiful countenance of calm sweetness, looking almost too young to be the mother of the tall Margaret, who followed her. There was a general hush as she greeted Miss Winter, the girls crowding round to look at their little sister, not quite six weeks old.",enter baby arm lady beautiful countenance calm sweetness look young mother tall follow be general hush greet girl crowd look little sister week old

62,"In the meantime Margaret, with the little babe, to-morrow to be her godchild, lying gently in her arms, came out into the matted hall, and began to mount the broad shallow-stepped staircase, protected by low stout balusters, with a very thick, flat, and solid mahogany hand-rail, polished by the boys’ constant riding up and down upon it. She was only on the first step, when the dining-room door opened, and there came out a young man, slight, and delicate-looking, with bright blue eyes, and thickly-curling light hair. “Acting nurse?” he said, smiling. “What an odd little face it is! I didn’t think little white babies were so pretty! Well, I shall always consider myself as the real godfather--the other is all a sham.”",meantime little babe godchild lie arm come matted hall begin mount broad shallow step staircase protect low stout baluster thick flat solid mahogany hand rail polished boy constant ride first step dining room door open come young man slight delicate look bright blue eye curl light hair acting nurse say smile odd little face think little white baby pretty consider real godfather other sham

65,"Then depositing her little charge with the nurse, and trying to cheer up a solemn-looking boy of three, who evidently considered his deposition from babyhood as a great injury, she tripped lightly down again, to take part in the Saturday’s reading and catechising.",deposit little charge nurse try cheer solemn look boy consider deposition babyhood great injury trip take part reading catechising 
66,"It was pleasant to see that large family in the hush and reverence of such teaching, the mother’s gentle power preventing the outbreaks of restlessness to which even at such times the wild young spirits were liable. Margaret and Miss Winter especially rejoiced in it on this occasion, the first since the birth of the baby, that she had been able to preside. Under her, though seemingly without her taking any trouble, there was none of the smothered laughing at the little mistakes, the fidgeting of the boys, or Harry’s audacious impertinence to Miss Winter; and no less glad was Harry to have his mother there, and be guarded from himself.",pleasant see large family hush reverence such teaching mother gentle power prevent outbreak restlessness such time wild young spirit liable rejoice occasion first birth baby able preside take trouble be smother laugh little mistake fidget boy audacious impertinence glad have mother guard 
67,"The Catechism was repeated, and a comment on the Sunday Services read aloud. The Gospel was that on the taking the lowest place, and when they had finished, Ethel said, “I like the verse which explains that:",repeat comment service read take low place finish say like verse explain 
68,"        ‘They who now sit lowest here,         When their Master shall appear,         He shall bid them higher rise,         And be highest in the skies.’”",sit low master appear bid high rise high sky

86,"“You are quite right, my dear Ethel,” said her mother; “and I am glad you have found in the Gospel a practical lesson, that should be useful to you both. I had rather you did so than that you read it in Greek, though that is very nice too,” she added, smiling, as she put her hand on a little Greek Testament, in which Ethel had been reading it, within her English Bible. “Now, go and mend that deplorable frock, and if you don’t dream over it, you won’t waste too much of your holiday.”",right dear say mother glad find practical lesson useful have do read nice add smile put hand little greek read english go mend deplorable frock dream waste much holiday 
87,"“I’ll get it done in no time!” cried Ethel, rushing headlong upstairs, twice tripping in it before she reached the attic, where she slept, as well as Flora and Mary--a large room in the roof, the windows gay with bird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen any one but girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and treasures, and a very fine view, from the dormer window, of the town sloping downwards, and the river winding away, with some heathy hills in the distance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes, Ethel lighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw on a shawl, and sat down cross-legged on her bed, stitching vigorously, while meantime she spouted with great emphasis an ode of Horace, which Norman having learned by heart, she had followed his example; it being her great desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though eleven months younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday, he showed her what were his tasks for the week, and as soon as her rent was repaired, she swung herself downstairs in search of him for this purpose. She found him in the drawing-room, a pretty, pleasant room--its only fault that it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to the lawn, and was full of pretty things, works and knick-knacks. Ethel found the state of affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was intent on a book on the sofa, and at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work with calculations and mathematical instruments. Ethel would not for the world that any one should guess at her classical studies--she scarcely liked to believe that even her father knew of them, and to mention them before Mr. Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved Norman, and asked him to come.",get do time cry rush trip reach attic sleep large room roof window gay bird cage flower canary sing deaf one girl headache unknown plenty book treasure fine view dormer window town slope river wind heathy hill distance poke peer short sight eye light work basket rare disorder pull frock throw shawl sit cross-legg bed stitch spout great emphasis ode learn heart follow example great desire study month young fall show task week rent repair swing search purpose find draw room pretty pleasant room only fault low have window open lawn full pretty thing work knick knack find state affair unfavourable intent book sofa table sit hard work calculation mathematical instrument world one guess classical study like believe father know mention dreadful shove ask come

92,"She fidgeted, till Mr. Ernescliffe asked Norman if there was a table of logarithms in the house.",fidget ask be table logarithm house

Don’t you remember papa’s telling us the meaning of them, when we had the grand book-dusting?”",answer know brown book upper shelf dining room remember papa tell meaning have grand book dusting 
94,"He was conscious of nothing but his book; however, she found the logarithms, and brought them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying to look at his drawing, and asking what he was making out. He replied, smiling at the impossibility of her understanding, but she wrinkled her brown forehead, hooked her long nose, and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.",conscious book find logarithm bring stay look draw ask make reply smile impossibility understanding wrinkle brown forehead hook long nose spend next hour amateur navigation 
95,"Market Stoneborough was a fine old town. The Minster, grand with the architecture of the time of Henry III., stood beside a broad river, and round it were the buildings of a convent, made by a certain good Bishop Whichcote, the nucleus of a grammar school, which had survived the Reformation, and trained up many good scholars; among them, one of England’s princely merchants, Nicholas Randall, whose effigy knelt in a niche in the chancel wall, scarlet-cloaked, white-ruffed, and black doubletted, a desk bearing an open Bible before him, and a twisted pillar of Derbyshire spar on each side. He was the founder of thirteen almshouses, and had endowed two scholarships at Oxford, the object of ambition of the Stoneborough boys, every eighteen months.",fine old town grand architecture time stand broad river building convent make certain good nucleus grammar school survive train many good scholar princely merchant effigy knolt niche chancel wall scarlet cloaked white ruff black doublett desk bear open twist pillar spar side founder almshouse endow scholarship object ambition boy month 
96,"There were about sixty or seventy boarders, and the town boys slept at home, and spent their weekly holiday there on Saturday--the happiest day in the week to the May family, when alone, they had the company at dinner of Norman and Harry, otherwise known by their school names of June and July, given them because their elder brother had begun the series of months as May.",be border town boy sleep home spend weekly holiday happy day week family have company dinner know school name give elder brother begin series month 
97,"Some two hundred years back, a Dr. Thomas May had been headmaster, but ever since that time there had always been an M. D., not a D. D., in the family, owning a comfortable demesne of spacious garden, and field enough for two cows, still green and intact, among modern buildings and improvements.",year headmaster time be family own comfortable demesne spacious garden field cow green intact modern building improvement 
98,"The present Dr. May stood very high in his profession, and might soon have made a large fortune in London, had he not held fast to his home attachments. He was extremely skilful and clever, with a boyish character that seemed as if it could never grow older; ardent, sensitive, and heedless, with a quickness of sympathy and tenderness of heart that was increased, rather than blunted, by exercise in scenes of suffering.",present stand high profession make large fortune hold fast home attachment skilful clever boyish character seem grow old ardent sensitive heedless quickness sympathy tenderness heart increase blunt exercise scene suffering 
99,"At the end of the previous summer holidays, Dr. May had been called one morning to attend a gentleman who had been taken very ill, at the Swan Inn.",end previous summer holiday call morning attend gentleman take ill 
100,"He was received by a little boy of ten years old, in much grief, explaining that his brother had come two days ago from London, to bring him to school here; he had seemed unwell ever since they met, and last night had become much worse. And extremely ill the doctor found him; a youth of two or three and twenty, suffering under a severe attack of fever, oppressed, and scarcely conscious, so as quite to justify his little brother’s apprehensions. He advised the boy to write to his family, but was answered by a look that went to his heart--“Alan”  was all he had in the world--father and mother were dead, and their relations lived in Scotland, and were hardly known to them.",receive little boy year old much grief explain brother come day bring school seem unwell meet last night become bad ill doctor find youth suffer severe attack fever oppress conscious justify little brother apprehension advise boy write family answer look go heart have world father mother dead relation live know

103,"“What, is he in the navy?”",navy 
104,"“Yes,” said the boy proudly, “Lieutenant Ernescliffe. He got his promotion last week. My father was in the battle of Trafalgar; and Alan has been three years in the West Indies, and then he was in the Mediterranean, and now on the coast of Africa, in the Atalantis. You must have heard about him, for it was in the newspaper, how, when he was mate, he had the command of the Santa Isabel, the slaver they captured.”",say boy get promotion last week father battle year coast hear newspaper mate have command slaver capture 
105,"The boy would have gone on for ever, if Dr. May had not recalled him to his brother’s present condition, and proceeded to take every measure for the welfare and comfort of the forlorn pair. He learned from other sources that the Ernescliffes were well connected. The father had been a distinguished officer, but had been ill able to provide for his sons; indeed, he died, without ever having seen little Hector, who was born during his absence on a voyage--his last, and Alan’s first. Alan, the elder by thirteen years, had been like a father to the little boy, showing judgment and self-denial that marked him of a high cast of character. He had distinguished himself in encounters with slave ships, and in command of a prize that he had had to conduct to Sierra Leone, he had shown great coolness and seamanship, in several perilous conjunctures, such as a sudden storm, and an encounter with another slaver, when his Portuguese prisoners became mutinous, and nothing but his steadiness and intrepidity had saved the lives of himself and his few English companions. He was, in fact, as Dr. May reported, pretty much of a hero. He had not, at the time, felt the effects of the climate, but, owing to sickness and death among the other officers, he had suffered much fatigue and pressure of mind and body. Immediately on his return, had followed his examination, and though he had passed with great credit, and it had been at once followed by well-earned promotion, his nervous excitable frame had been overtasked, and the consequence was a long and severe illness.",boy go recall brother present condition proceed take measure welfare comfort forlorn pair learn other source connect father distinguished officer ill able provide son die see little bear absence voyage last first elder year father little boy show judgment self denial mark high cast character distinguish encounter slave ship command prize have conduct show great coolness seamanship several perilous conjuncture such sudden storm encounter slaver portuguese prisoner become mutinous steadiness intrepidity save life few english companion fact report much hero time feel effect climate ow sickness death other officer suffer much fatigue pressure mind body return follow examination pass great credit follow earn promotion nervous excitable frame overtask consequence long severe illness 
106,"The Swan Inn was not forty yards from Dr. May’s back gate, and, at every spare moment, he was doing the part of nurse as well as doctor, professionally obliged to Alan Ernescliffe for bringing him a curious exotic specimen of fever, and requiting him by the utmost care and attention, while, for their own sakes, he delighted in the two boys with all the enthusiasm of his warm heart. Before the first week was at an end, they had learned to look on the doctor as one of the kindest friends it had been their lot to meet with, and Alan knew that if he died, he should leave his little brother in the hands of one who would comfort him as a father.",yard back gate spare moment do part nurse doctor oblige bring curious exotic specimen fever requit utmost care attention own sake delight boy enthusiasm warm heart first week end learn look doctor kindest friend lot meet know die leave little brother hand comfort father 
107,"No sooner was young Ernescliffe able to sit up, than Dr. May insisted on conveying him to his own house, as his recovery was likely to be tedious in solitude at the Swan. It was not till he had been drawn in a chair along the sloping garden, and placed on the sofa to rest, that he discovered that the time the good doctor had chosen for bringing a helpless convalescent to his house, was two days after an eleventh child had been added to his family.",young able sit insist convey own house recovery likely tedious solitude draw chair slope garden place sofa rest discover time good doctor choose bring helpless convalescent house day eleventh child add family 
108,"Mrs. May was too sorry for the solitary youth, and too sympathising with her husband, to make any objection, though she was not fond of strangers, and had some anxieties. She had the utmost dependence on Margaret’s discretion, but there was a chance of awkward situations, which papa was not likely to see or guard against. However, all seemed to do very well, and no one ever came into her room without some degree of rapture about Mr. Ernescliffe. The doctor reiterated praises of his excellence, his principle, his ability and talent, his amusing talk; the girls were always bringing reports of his perfections; Norman retracted his grumbling at having his evenings spoiled; and “the boys” were bursting with the secret that he was teaching them to rig a little ship that was to astonish mamma on her first coming downstairs, and to be named after the baby; while Blanche did all the coquetry with him, from which Margaret abstained. The universal desire was for mamma to see him, and when the time came, she owned that papa’s swan had not turned out a goose.",sorry solitary youth sympathise husband make objection fond stranger have anxiety have utmost dependence discretion be chance awkward situation papa likely see guard seem do come room degree rapture doctor reiterate praise excellence principle ability talent amusing talk girl bring report perfection retract grumbling have evening spoiled boy burst secret teach rig little ship astonish mamma first come name baby do coquetry abstain universal desire mamma see time come own papa swan turn goose
