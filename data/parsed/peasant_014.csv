1,CHAPTER 10. THE MOB IN THE PALACE.,chapter mob palace 
2,"The angry people rose.  Twenty-thousand of the poorest, dirtiest, and most savage, went to the magistrates in a body, to declare their intention of planting the Tree of Liberty on a terrace of the Tuileries, on the 20th; and of presenting, at the same time, petitions to the king against his late prohibitions about the priests and the army.  It was easy to see what sort of petitions these were likely to be; but it had become difficult to make preparation for any expected public event,-- there were so many opinions to be consulted, and so much suspicion was abroad.",angry person rise poor dirtiest savage go magistrate body declare intention plant terrace 20th present same time petition king late prohibition priest army easy see sort petition likely become difficult make preparation expect public event be many opinion consult much suspicion 
3,"Early in the morning of the 20th, a tall Lombardy poplar, which the people called their tree of liberty, was lying on a car in the lower part of the city, and the people were collecting in multitudes to make a procession with it to the palace.  A messenger from the magistrates spoke to the people against their scheme; but they said they were only going to do what they had a right to do: it was lawful to petition; and that was their errand.  So, on they went, their numbers being swelled by groups from every by-street on their way.  They drew two pieces of cannon with them, and carried abundance of tricolour flags and ribbons; and also various significant emblems, one of which was a bullock's heart with a spear through it, labelled ""the Aristocrat's heart.""  The magistrates next met them: but again the crowd declared they intended only what was lawful, and pushed on.",morning 20th tall poplar person call tree liberty lie car low part city person collect multitude make procession palace messenger magistrate speak person scheme say go do have right do lawful petition errand go number swell group street way draw piece cannon carry abundance tricolour flag ribbon various significant emblem bullock heart spear label aristocrat heart magistrate meet crowd declare intend lawful push 
4,"They read their address in the Assembly, and then went, dancing and shouting, to plant their tree.  The iron gates of the Tuileries were all shut, and National soldiers and cannon appeared within; so that the tree could not be planted on the terrace, as designed.  There was a convent garden near, which served their purpose, and there was the tree of liberty erected.",read address go dance shouting plant tree iron gate shut national soldier appear tree plant terrace design be convent garden serve purpose be tree liberty erect 
5,"While this was doing, the Assembly dispersed till evening.  The crowd desired that the king would come out, and hear their petition.  They waited and waited, pressing against the iron gates, till some were near being pressed to death, and were not in the better humour for that.  The king did not appear.  After a while, the guard within were told that, if the king would not come out to his people, his people would go in to him.  As usual, there was no decision in the treatment of the people. After some hesitation, the guards opened one of the gates.  The multitude swarmed in; rushed at a wooden door of the palace; shivered it; and the royal household were at once at their mercy.",do disperse evening crowd desire king come hear petition wait wait press iron gate press death good humour king appear while guard tell king come person person go usual be decision treatment person hesitation guard open gate multitude swarm rush wooden door palace shiver royal household mercy 
6,"Now at last the sovereign and his craving people met, face to face: met, too, that they might petition, and he reply.  But they were no longer fitted for coming to an understanding.  They despised him as weak, and a double-dealer; and he despised them for their ignorance, their tatters, and dirt.  He showed this day that he was no coward.  He was indolent, irresolute, and unable to act; but he could endure.  After this day, no one could, unrebuked, call him a coward.  When the mob began battering upon the door of the room in which he was, he ordered it to be thrown open.  Some of the gentlemen of his household had rushed in through another door, and requested him to stand in the recess of a large window.  They drove up a heavy table before him, and ranged themselves in front of it.  They begged him not to be alarmed.  ""Put your hand on my heart,"" replied the king, ""and see if I am afraid.""  The Princess Elizabeth flew to see what was doing to her brother.  She heard fierce threats from the mob against the queen.  They vowed they would have the blood of the mischievous Austrian woman.  The attendants begged the princess to go away from this scene.  ""No,"" said she, ""let them take me for the queen, and then she may have time to escape.""  They forced her away, however, with what emotions of admiration words cannot express.",last sovereign craving person meet face face meet petition reply fit come understanding despise weak double dealer despise ignorance tatter dirt show day coward indolent irresolute unable act endure day unrebuked call coward mob begin batter door room order throw open gentleman household rush door request stand recess large window drive heavy table rang front begg alarm put hand heart reply king see afraid fly see do brother hear fierce threat mob queen vow have blood mischievous austrian woman attendant begg princess go scene say let take queen have time escape force emotion admiration word express 
7,"The king demanded of the riotous crowd what it was that they wanted. They cried that they would have the patriot ministers back again, and no prohibition about the clergy and the army.  The king replied that this was not the way, nor the time, to settle such matters.  Those who heard him must have respected him for having at last given a good and decided answer.  During the rest of the time, about three hours, he stood in the recess of the window, while the mob passed to and fro before the broad table which stood between him and them.  At the very beginning of the scene one of the people handed him a red woollen cap, such as the furious revolutionary people had taken to wearing, to show their patriotism.  This cap the king was bid to wear.  He put it on; and it was matter of complaint against him afterwards by his aristocratic adherents, that he had worn the red cap for three hours.  The fact was that he did not feel the cap on the top of his hair, matted with pomatum and powder as hair then was, and forgot it, till his family noticed it on his meeting them again.  He declared himself thirsty, and a ragamuffin handing him a half-empty bottle, he drank from it.",king demand riotous crowd want cry have patriot minister prohibition clergy army king reply way time settle such matter hear respect give good decide answer rest time hour stand recess window mob pass for broad table stand very beginning scene person hand red woollen cap such furious revolutionary person take wear show patriotism cap king bid wear put matter complaint aristocratic adherent wear red cap hour fact feel cap top hair matt pomatum powder hair forget family notice meeting declare thirsty ragamuffin hand half empty bottle drink 
8,"The queen had attempted, with her children, to reach the room where the king was, but could not.  Each seems to have believed that it was the intention of the mob to murder one or both of them, and there was much said of the murderers' arms which were carried; but it does not now appear probable that there was any such intention.  There was nothing to prevent its execution; for the multitude could in a moment have overpowered ten times the number of adherents that were about the royal family; and the Assembly were not seen or heard of till past six, when the mob had been parading about the palace for an hour and a half. However, the royal party did expect murder, and their suspense of three hours must have been terrible.",queen attempt child reach room king seem believe intention mob murder be say murderer arm carry appear probable be such intention be prevent execution multitude moment overpower time number adherent royal family see hear past mob parade palace hour half royal party expect murder suspense hour terrible 
9,"The queen was secured, like the king, behind a table.  She put a large tricolor cockade upon her head, and placed the Dauphin on a table before her.  There sat poor little Louis, with a great red woollen cap covering his head, down to his very eyes, seeing how his governess and the other ladies behind his mother were terrified, and perhaps finding out how his mother's heart was swelling, and well-nigh bursting, while her face and manner were calm and dignified.  He saw, too, the horrible things that were shown in the procession.  The bullock's heart was there; and there was a little gibbet, with a little doll hung to it, and his mother's name written below.  He heard many dreadful things said to her; but he also heard her answers, and saw that they pleased the people.  One angry woman stood and railed at the queen.  The queen asked whether she had ever seen her before, and whether she had ever done her any injury. ""No,"" said the woman; ""but it is you who have done the country so much harm.""",queen secure king table put large tricolor cockade head place table sit poor little great red woollen cap cover head very eye see governess other lady mother terrified find mother heart swell nigh burst face manner calm dignified see horrible thing show procession bullock heart be little gibbet little doll hang mother name write hear many dreadful thing say hear answer see pleased person angry woman stand rail queen queen ask see do injury say woman do country much harm 
10,"""You have been told so; but you are mistaken,"" said the queen.  ""Being the wife of the king of France, and mother of the Dauphin, I am a Frenchwoman.  I shall never see my own country again; it is in France that I must be happy or unhappy.  I was very happy till you began to hate me.""  The woman was softened at once.  She said, with tears, ""I did not know you.  I see now that you are good.""",tell mistaken say queen wife king mother see own country happy unhappy happy begin hate woman soften say tear know see good 
11,"The queen could not in the least comprehend the hatred of royalty, which had now become common.  She could not comprehend it, because she was born royal; and it seemed to her as natural that princes should be served and obeyed by everybody below them as that children should be ruled by their parents.  She also knew nothing of the miseries caused for long years past by the abuse of power by both kings and nobles, and by herself among the rest.  Unconscious of all this, she could make nothing of what she heard this evening from a member of the Assembly.-- Some of the members arrived at six o'clock, too late to do any good. The queen directed their notice to the broken doors, bidding them observe the outrageous way in which the home of the royal family had been violated.  She saw signs of emotion in the countenance of Monsieur Merlin de Thionville, and observed upon it.  Monsieur Merlin replied that he felt for her as a woman, a wife, and mother, but that she must not suppose that he shed a single tear for the king or the queen; that he hated kings and queens.  It was the only feeling he had towards them; it was his religion.--Now, however extravagant this man's feelings might be, and however harsh his expression of them, such sayings might have been a valuable lesson to one who could reflect and reason upon them, and diligently try to discover how such feelings could have grown up in millions of minds.  This, however, the poor queen never thought of doing.  She called it madness; and felt as if in Bedlam, while surrounded by those who were of the same mind as Monsieur Merlin.",queen least comprehend hatred royalty become common comprehend bear royal seem natural prince serve obey child rule parent know misery cause long year abuse power king noble rest unconscious make hear evening member member arrive o'clock late do good queen direct notice break door bid observe outrageous way home royal family violate see sign emotion countenance observe reply feel woman wife mother suppose shed single tear king queen hate king queen only feeling have religion extravagant man feeling harsh expression such saying valuable lesson reflect reason try discover such feeling grow million mind poor queen think do call madness feel surround same mind 
12,"At last the Mayor of Paris came.  Monsieur Petion was now mayor: the same who had pulled Louis's hair, on the return from Varennes, a year before.  He harangued the people: several others harangued; and at last the mob marched out through the broken doors of the violated palace.  It was eight in the evening.  When the members of this unhappy family could get to one another, again, when they felt that they were once more alone, they threw themselves into one another's arms, weeping bitterly. The monarch and his people had met at last, face to face; and it was only to find that there was, and could be, no agreement between them. One of the parties must give way: the people were strong; the king was weak, and his ruin was now certain.  Little Louis understood nothing of all this; but one wonders whether he could sleep that night,--whether he could forget the frightful procession he had seen filling the very rooms in which he lived.",last come mayor same pull hair return year harangue person several other harangue last mob march break door violate palace evening member unhappy family get feel alone throw arm weep monarch person meet last face face find be agreement party give way person strong king weak ruin certain little understand wonder sleep night forget frightful procession see fill very room live
