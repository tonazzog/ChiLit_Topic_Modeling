1,CHAPTER III.,
2," It may appear strange that, after having been in possession of the estate for ten years, and considering that he had younger children to provide for, Mr. Campbell had not laid up a larger sum; but this can be fully explained. As I before said, the estate was in very bad order when Mr. Campbell came into possession, and he devoted a large portion of the income to improving it; and, secondly, he had expended a considerable sum in building almshouses and schools, works which he would not delay, as he considered them as religious obligations. The consequence was, that it was not until a year before the claim was made to the estate, that he had commenced laying by for his younger children; and as the estate was then worth £2,000 per annum more than it was at the time that he came into possession of it, he had resolved to put by £5,000 per annum, and had done so for twelve months. The enormous legal expenses had, however, swallowed up this sum, and more, as we have already stated; and thus he was left a poorer man by some hundreds than he was when the property fell to him. The day after the valuation, the eldest son, Henry, made his appearance; he seemed much dejected, more so than his parents, and those who knew him, would have supposed. It was, however, ascribed to his feeling for his father and mother, rather than for himself.",appear strange possession estate year consider have young child provide lay large sum explain say estate bad order come possession devote large portion income improve expend considerable sum build almshouse school work delay consider religious obligation consequence year claim make estate commence lay young child estate worth annum more time come possession resolve put annum do month enormous legal expense swallow sum more state leave poorer man hundred property fall day valuation old son make appearance seem deject parent know suppose ascribe feeling father mother 
3,"Many were the consultations held by Mr. and Mrs. Campbell as to their future plans; but nothing at all feasible, or likely to prove advantageous, suggested itself to them. With only sixteen or seventeen hundred pounds, they scarcely knew where to go, or how to act. Return to his profession Mr. Campbell knew that he could not, with any chance of supporting his family. His eldest son, Henry, might obtain a situation, but he was really fit for nothing but the bar or holy orders; and how were they to support him till he could support himself? Alfred, who was now a master's mate, could, it is true, support himself, but it would be with difficulty, and there was little chance of his promotion. Then there were the two other boys, and the two girls growing up fast; in short, a family of eight people. To put so small a sum in the funds would be useless, as they could not live upon the interest which it would give, and how to employ it they knew not. They canvassed the matter over and over, but without success, and each night they laid their heads upon the pillow more and more disheartened. They were all ready to leave the Hall, but knew not where to direct their steps when they left it; and thus they continued wavering for a week, until they were embraced by their son Alfred, who had made all speed to join them, as soon as the ship had been paid off. After the first joy of meeting between those who had been separated so long was over, Mr. Campbell said, ""I'm sorry, Alfred, that I could not give your messmates any fishing.""",many consultation hold future plan feasible likely prove advantageous suggest pound know go act return profession know chance support family old son obtain situation fit bar holy order support support master mate true support difficulty be little chance promotion be other boy girl grow short family person put small sum fund useless live interest give employ know canvass matter success night lay head pillow dishearten ready leave know direct step leave continue waver week embrace son make speed join ship pay first joy meeting separate say sorry give messmate fishing 
4,"""And so am I, and so were they, for your sakes, my dear father and mother; but what is, is--and what can't be helped, can't--so we must make the best of it; but where's Henry and my cousins?""",sake dear father mother help make good cousin 
5,"""They are walking in the park, Alfred; you had better join them; they are most anxious to see you.""",walk park good join anxious see 
6,"""I will, mother; let us get over these huggings and kissings, and then we shall be more rational: so good-by for half an hour,"" said Alfred, kissing his mother again, and then hastening out of the room.",mother let get hugging kissing rational good hour say kiss mother hasten room 
7,"""His spirits are not subdued, at all events,"" observed Mrs. Campbell. ""I thank God for it.""",spirit subdued event observe thank 
8,"Alfred soon fell in with his brother and his cousins, Mary and Emma, and after the huggings and kissings, as he termed them, were over, he made inquiries into the real state of his father's affairs. After a short conversation, Henry, who was very much depressed in his spirits, said, ""Mary and Emma, perhaps you will now go in; I wish to have some conversation with Alfred.""",fall brother cousin hugging kissing term make inquiry real state father affair short conversation depressed spirit say go wish have conversation 
9,"""You are terribly out of heart, Harry,"" observed Alfred, after his cousins had left them. ""Are things so very bad?""",heart observe cousin leave thing bad 
10,"""They are bad enough, Alfred; but what makes me so low-spirited is, that I fear my folly has made them worse.""",bad make low spirit fear folly make bad 
11,"""How so?"" replied Alfred.",reply 
12,"""The fact is, that my father has but £1,700 left in the world, a sum small enough; but what annoys me is this. When I was at college, little imagining such a reverse of fortune, I anticipated my allowance, because I knew that I could pay at Christmas, and I ran in debt about £200; My father always cautioned me not to exceed my allowance, and thinks that I have not done so. Now, I can not bear the idea of leaving college in debt, and, at the same time, it will be a heavy blow to my poor father, if he has to part with £200, out of his trifling remainder, to pay my debt. This is what has made me so unhappy. I can not bear to tell him, because I feel convinced that he is so honorable, he will pay it immediately. I am mad with myself, and really do not know what to do. I do nothing but reproach myself all day, and I can not sleep at night. I have been very foolish, but I am sure you will kindly enter into my present feelings. I waited till you came home, because I thought you had better tell my father the fact, for I feel as if I should die with shame and vexation.""",fact father have leave world sum small annoy college little imagin reverse fortune anticipate allowance know pay run debt father caution exceed allowance think do bear idea leave college debt same time heavy blow poor father have part trifling remainder pay debt make unhappy bear tell feel convinced honorable pay mad know do do reproach day sleep night foolish sure enter present feeling wait come think good tell father fact feel die shame vexation 
13,"""Look you, Harry,"" replied Alfred, ""as for outrunning the constable, as we term it at sea, it's a very common thing, and, all things considered, no great harm done, when you suppose that you have the means, and intend to pay; so don't lay that to heart. That you would give your right hand not to have done so, as things have turned out, I really believe; but, however, there is no occasion to fret any more about it. I have received three years' pay, and the prize-money for the last eighteen months, and there is still some more due, for a French privateer. Altogether it amounts to £250, which I had intended to have made over to my father, now that he is on a lee-shore; but it will come to the same thing, whether I give it to you to pay your debts, or give it to him, as he will pay them, if you do not; so here it is, take what you want, and hand me over what's left. My father don't know that I have any money, and now he won't know it; at the same time he won't know that you owe any; so that squares the account, and he will be as well off as ever.""",look reply outrunn constable term sea common thing thing consider great harm do suppose have means intend pay lay heart give right hand do thing turn believe be occasion fret more receive year pay prize money last month be due french privateer amount intend make father shore come same thing give pay debt give pay take want hand leave father know have money know same time know owe square account 
14,"""Thank you, my dear Alfred; you don't know what a relief this will be to my mind. Now I can look my father in his face.""",thank dear know relief mind look father face 
15,"""I hope you will; we are not troubled with such delicate feelings on board ship, Harry. I should have told him the truth long before this. I couldn't bear to keep any thing on my conscience. If this misfortune had happened last cruise, I should have been just in your position; for I had a tailor's bill to pay as long as a frigate's pennant, and not enough in my pocket to buy a mouse's breakfast. Now, let's go in again, and be as merry as possible, and cheer them up a little.""",hope trouble such delicate feeling board ship tell truth bear keep thing conscience misfortune happen last cruise position have tailor bill pay frigate pennant pocket buy mouse breakfast let go merry possible cheer little 
16,"Alfred's high spirits did certainly do much to cheer them all up; and after tea, Mr. Campbell, who had previously consulted his wife, as soon as the servant had quitted the room, entered on a full explanation of the means which were left to them; and stated, that he wished in his difficulty to put the question before the whole family, and ascertain whether any project might come into their heads upon which they might decide and act. Henry, who had recovered his spirits since the assistance he had received from Alfred, was desired to speak first. He replied:",high spirit do much cheer tea consult wife servant quit room enter full explanation means leave state wish difficulty put question whole family ascertain project come head decide act recover spirit assistance receive desire speak reply 
17,"""My dear father and mother, if you can not between you hit upon any plan, I am afraid it is not likely that I can assist you. All I have to say is, that whatever may be decided upon, I shall most cheerfully do my duty toward you and my brothers and sisters. My education has not been one likely to be very useful to a poor man, but I am ready to work with my hands as well as with my head, to the best of my abilities.""",dear father mother hit plan afraid likely assist have say decide do duty brother sister education likely useful poor man ready work hand head good ability 
18,"""That I am sure of, my dear boy,"" replied his father. ""Now, Alfred, we must look to you as our last hope, for your two cousins are not likely to give us much advice.""",sure dear boy reply father look last hope cousin likely give much advice 
19,"""Well, father, I have been thinking a good deal about it, and I have a proposal to make which may at first startle you, but it appears to me that it is our only, and our best, resource. The few hundred pounds which you have left are of no use in this country, except to keep you from starving for a year or two; but in another country they may be made to be worth as many thousands. In this country, a large family becomes a heavy charge and expense; in another country, the more children you have, the richer man you are. If, therefore, you would consent to transport your family and your present means into another country, instead of being a poor, you might be a rich man.""",father think good deal have proposal make first startle appear only good resource few pound leave use country keep starve year country make worth many thousand country large family become heavy charge expense country more child have richer man consent transport family present means country poor rich man 
20,"""What country is that, Alfred?""",country 
21,"""Why, father, the purser of our ship had a brother, who, soon after the French were beaten out of the Canadas, went out there to try his fortune. He had only three hundred pounds in the world: he has been there now about four years, and I read a letter from him which the purser received when the frigate arrived at Portsmouth, in which he states that he is doing well, and getting rich fast; that he has a farm of five hundred acres, of which two hundred are cleared; and that if he only had some children large enough to help him, he would soon be worth ten times the money, as he would purchase more land immediately. Land is to be bought there at a dollar an acre, and you may pick and choose. With your money, you might buy a large property; with your children, you might improve it fast; and in a few years, you would at all events be comfortable, if not flourishing, in your circumstances. Your children would work for you, and you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you left them independent and happy.""",father purser ship have brother beat go try fortune have pound world year read letter purser receive frigate arrive state do get rich have farm acre clear have child large help worth time money purchase more land land buy dollar acre pick choose money buy large property child improve few year event comfortable flourish circumstance child work have satisfaction know leave independent happy 
22,"""I acknowledge, my dear boy, that you have struck upon a plan which has much to recommend it. Still there are drawbacks.""",acknowledge dear boy strike plan have much recommend be drawback 
23,"""Drawbacks!"" replied Alfred, ""yes, to be sure, there are; if estates were to be picked up for merely going out for them, there would not be many left for you to choose; but, my dear father, I know no drawbacks which can not be surmounted. Let us see what these drawbacks are. First, hard labor; occasional privation; a log hut, till we can get a better; severe winter; isolation from the world; occasional danger, even from wild beasts and savages. I grant these are but sorry exchanges for such a splendid mansion as this--fine furniture, excellent cooking, polished society, and the interest one feels for what is going on in our own country, which is daily communicated to us. Now, as to hard labor, I and Henry will take as much of that off your hands as we can: if the winter is severe, there is no want of firewood; if the cabin is rude, at least we will make it comfortable; if we are shut out from the world, we shall have society enough among ourselves; if we are in danger, we will have firearms and stout hearts to defend ourselves; and, really, I do not see but we may be very happy, very comfortable, and, at all events, very independent.""",drawback reply sure be estate pick go be many left choose dear father know drawback surmount let see drawback first hard labor occasional privation log hut get good severe winter isolation world occasional danger wild beast savage grant sorry exchange splendid mansion fine furniture excellent cooking polished society interest feel go own country communicate hard labor take much hand winter severe be want firewood cabin rude least make comfortable shut world have society danger have firearm stout heart defend see happy comfortable event independent

No--no--I love the service, it is true, but I know my duty, which is, to assist my father and mother: in fact, I prefer it; a midshipman's ideas of independence are very great; and I had rather range the wilds of America free and independent, than remain in the service, and have to touch my hat to every junior lieutenant, perhaps for twenty years to come. If you go, I go, that is certain. Why, I should be miserable if you went without me; I should dream every night that an Indian had run away with Mary, or that a bear had eaten up my little Emma.""",think dear mother imagine remain presence useful love service true know duty assist father mother fact prefer midshipman idea independence great range wild free independent remain service have touch hat junior lieutenant year come go go certain miserable go dream night run bear eat little

53,"A few hours after this conversation, Henry and Alfred left the Hall upon their several destinations. Mr. and Mrs. Campbell and the two girls had plenty of employment for three or four days in packing up. It was soon spread through the neighborhood that they were going to emigrate to Canada; and the tenants who had held their farms under Mr. Campbell, all came forward and proffered their wagons and horses to transport the effects to Liverpool, without his being put to any expense.",few hour conversation leave several destination girl have plenty employment day pack spread neighborhood go emigrate tenant hold farm come proffer wagon horse transport effect put expense 
54,"In the meantime a letter had been received from Alfred, who had not been idle. He had made acquaintance with some merchants who traded to Canada, and by them had been introduced to two or three persons who had settled there a few years before, and who were able to give him every information. They informed him what was most advisable to take out; how they were to proceed upon their landing; and, what was of more importance, the merchants gave him letters of introduction to English merchants at Quebec, who would afford them every assistance in the selecting and purchasing of land, and in their transport up the country. Alfred had also examined a fine timber-ship, which was to sail in three weeks; and had bargained for the price of their passage, in case they could get ready in time to go by her. He wrote all these particulars to his father, waiting for his reply to act upon his wishes.",meantime letter receive idle make acquaintance merchant trade introduce person settle few year able give information inform advisable take proceed landing more importance merchant give letter introduction english merchant afford assistance select purchase land transport country examine fine timber ship sail week bargain price passage case get ready time go write particular father wait reply act wish

He was full of spirits, and of the greatest assistance to his father and mother.",return settle account produce sale classic other book pocket full spirit great assistance father mother 
56,"Alfred had shown so much judgment in all he had undertaken, that his father wrote to him stating that they would be ready for the ship which he named, and that he might engage the cabins, and also at once procure the various articles which they were advised to take out with them, and draw upon him for the amount, if the people would not wait for the money. In a fortnight they were all ready; the wagons had left with their effects some days before. Mr. Campbell wrote a letter to Mr. Douglas Campbell, thanking him for his kindness and consideration to them, and informing him that they would leave Wexton Hall on the following day. He only begged, as a favor, that the schoolmaster and schoolmistress of the village school should be continued on, as it was of great importance that the instruction of the poor should not be neglected; and added, that perceiving by the newspapers that Mr. Douglas Campbell had lately married, Mrs. Campbell and he wished him and his wife every happiness, etc., etc.",show much judgment undertake father write state ready ship name engage cabin procure various article advise take draw amount person wait money fortnight ready wagon leave effect day write letter thank kindness consideration inform leave follow day begg favor schoolmaster schoolmistress village school continue great importance instruction poor neglect add perceive newspaper marry wish wife happiness etc. etc. 
57,"Having dispatched this letter, there was nothing more to be done, previous to their departure from the Hall, except to pay and dismiss the few servants who were with them; for Mrs. Campbell had resolved upon taking none out with her. That afternoon they walked round the plantation and park for the last time. Mrs. Campbell and the girls went round the rooms of the Hall to ascertain that every thing was left tidy, neat, and clean. The poor girls sighed as they passed by the harp and piano in the drawing-room, for they were old friends.",dispatch letter be more do previous departure pay dismiss few servant resolve take afternoon walk plantation park last time girl go room ascertain thing leave tidy neat clean poor girl sigh pass harp piano draw room old friend

59,"The following morning, the coach, of which they had secured the whole of the inside, drove up to the Hall door, and they all got in, the tenants and poor people standing round them, all with their hats in their hands out of respect, and wishing them every success as they drove away through the avenue to the park gates. The Hall and the park itself had been long out of sight before a word was exchanged. They checked their tears, but their hearts were too full for them to venture to speak.",follow morning coach secure whole inside drive door get tenant poor person stand hat hand respect wish success drive avenue park gate park long sight word exchange check tear heart full venture speak 
60,"The day afterward they arrived at Liverpool, where Alfred had provided lodgings. Every thing had been sent on board, and the ship had hauled out in the stream. As they had nothing to detain them on the shore, and the captain wished to take advantage of the first fair wind, they all embarked four days after their arrival at Liverpool; and I shall now leave them on board of the London Merchant, which was the name of the vessel, making all their little arrangements previous to their sailing, under the superintendence of Alfred, while I give some little more insight into the characters, ages, and dispositions of the family.",day arrive provide lodging thing send board ship haul stream have detain shore captain wish take advantage first fair wind embark day arrival leave board name vessel make little arrangement previous sailing superintendence give little more insight character age disposition family
