2," Horace was feeling particularly happy as he walked back the next evening to Vincent Square. He had the consciousness of having done a good day's work, for the sketch-plans for Mr. Wackerbath's mansion were actually completed and despatched to his business address, while Ventimore now felt a comfortable assurance that his designs would more than satisfy his client.",feel happy walk next evening have consciousness do good day work sketch plan mansion complete despatch business address feel comfortable assurance design satisfy client 
3,"But it was not that which made him so light of heart. That night his rooms were to be honoured for the first time by Sylvia's presence. She would tread upon his carpet, sit in his chairs, comment upon, and perhaps even handle, his books and ornaments--and all of them would retain something of her charm for ever after. If she only came! For even now he could not quite believe that she really would; that some untoward event would not make a point of happening to prevent her, as he sometimes doubted whether his engagement was not too sweet and wonderful to be true--or, at all events, to last.",make light heart night room honoure first time presence tread carpet sit chair comment handle book ornament retain charm come believe untoward event make point happen prevent doubt engagement sweet wonderful true event last 
4,"As to the dinner, his mind was tolerably easy, for he had settled the remaining details of the _menu_ with his landlady that morning, and he could hope that without being so sumptuous as to excite the Professor's wrath, it would still be not altogether unworthy--and what goods could be rare and dainty enough?--to be set before Sylvia.",dinner mind easy settle remain detail _menu_ landlady morning hope sumptuous excite wrath unworthy goods rare dainty set 
5,"He would have liked to provide champagne, but he knew that wine would savour of ostentation in the Professor's judgment, so he had contented himself instead with claret, a sound vintage which he knew he could depend upon. Flowers, he thought, were clearly permissible, and he had called at a florist's on his way and got some chrysanthemums of palest yellow and deepest terra-cotta, the finest he could see. Some of them would look well on the centre of the table in an old Nankin blue-and-white bowl he had; the rest he could arrange about the room: there would just be time to see to all that before dressing.",like provide champagne know wine savour ostentation judgment content claret sound vintage know depend flower think permissible call florist way get chrysanthemuum palest yellow deep terra cotta fine see look centre table old blue white bowl have rest arrange room be time see dress 
6,"Occupied with these thoughts, he turned into Vincent Square, which looked vaster than ever with the murky haze, enclosed by its high railings, and under a wide expanse of steel-blue sky, across which the clouds were driving fast like ships in full sail scudding for harbour before a storm. Against the mist below, the young and nearly leafless trees showed flat, black profiles as of pressed seaweed, and the sky immediately above the house-tops was tinged with a sullen red from miles of lighted streets; from the river came the long-drawn tooting of tugs, mingled with the more distant wail and hysterical shrieks of railway engines on the Lambeth lines.",occupy thought turn look vaster murky haze enclose high railing wide expanse steel blue sky cloud drive ship full sail scudding harbour storm mist young leafless tree show flat black profile press seaweed sky house top ting sullen red mile light street river come long draw tooting tug mingle distant wail hysterical shriek railway engine line 
7,"And now he reached the old semi-detached house in which he lodged, and noticed for the first time how the trellis-work of the veranda made, with the bared creepers and hanging baskets, a kind of decorative pattern against the windows, which were suffused with a roseate glow that looked warm and comfortable and hospitable. He wondered whether Sylvia would notice it when she arrived.",reach old semi detach house lodg notice first time trellis work veranda make bare creeper hanging basket kind decorative pattern window suffuse roseate glow look warm comfortable hospitable wonder notice arrive 
8,"He passed under the old wrought-iron arch that once held an oil-lamp, and up a short but rather steep flight of steps, which led to a brick porch built out at the side. Then he let himself in, and stood spellbound with perplexed amazement,--for he was in a strange house.",pass old wrought iron arch hold oil lamp short steep flight step lead brick porch build side let stand spellbound perplex amazement strange house 
9,"In place of the modest passage with the yellow marble wall-paper, the mahogany hat-stand, and the elderly barometer in a state of chronic depression which he knew so well, he found an arched octagonal entrance-hall with arabesques of blue, crimson, and gold, and richly-embroidered hangings; the floor was marble, and from a shallow basin of alabaster in the centre a perfumed fountain rose and fell with a lulling patter.",place modest passage yellow marble wall paper mahogany hat stand elderly barometer state chronic depression know find arched octagonal entrance hall arabesque blue crimson gold embroider hanging floor marble shallow basin alabaster centre perfumed fountain rise fall lull patter 
10,"""I must have mistaken the number,"" he thought, quite forgetting that his latch-key had fitted, and he was just about to retreat before his intrusion was discovered, when the hangings parted, and Mrs. Rapkin presented herself, making so deplorably incongruous a figure in such surroundings, and looking so bewildered and woebegone, that Horace, in spite of his own increasing uneasiness, had some difficulty in keeping his gravity.",mistaken number think forget latch key fit about retreat intrusion discover hanging part present make incongruous figure such surroundings look bewilder woebegone spite own increase uneasiness have difficulty keep gravity 
11,"""Oh, Mr. Ventimore, sir,"" she lamented; ""whatever _will_ you go and do next, I wonder? To think of your going and having the whole place done up and altered out of knowledge like this, without a word of warning! If any halterations were required, I _do_ think as me and Rapkin had the right to be consulted.""",sir lament _will_ go do wonder think go have whole place do alter knowledge word warning halteration require think have right consult 
12,"Horace let all his chrysanthemums drop unheeded into the fountain. He understood now: indeed, he seemed in some way to have understood almost from the first, only he would not admit it even to himself.",let chrysanthemuum drop unheeded fountain understand seem way understand first admit 
13,"The irrepressible Jinnee was at the bottom of this, of course. He remembered now having made that unfortunate remark the day before about the limited accommodation his rooms afforded.",irrepressible bottom course remember make unfortunate remark day limited accommodation room afford 
14,"Clearly Fakrash must have taken a mental note of it, and, with that insatiable munificence which was one of his worst failings, had determined, by way of a pleasant surprise, to entirely refurnish and redecorate the apartments according to his own ideas.",take mental note insatiable munificence bad failing determine way pleasant surprise refurnish redecorate apartment accord own idea 
15,"It was extremely kind of him; it showed a truly grateful disposition--""but, oh!"" as Horace thought, in the bitterness of his soul, ""if he would only learn to let well alone and mind his own business!""",kind show grateful disposition think bitterness soul learn let alone mind own business 
16,"However, the thing was done now, and he must accept the responsibility for it, since he could hardly disclose the truth. ""Didn't I mention I was having some alterations made?"" he said carelessly. ""They've got the work done rather sooner than I expected. Were--were they long over it?""",thing do accept responsibility disclose truth mention have alteration make say get work do expect long 
17,"""I'm sure I can't tell you, sir, having stepped out to get some things I wanted in for to-night; and Rapkin, he was round the corner at his reading-room; and when I come back it was all done and the workmen gone 'ome; and how they could have finished such a job in the time beats me altogether, for when we 'ad the men in to do the back kitchen they took ten days over it.""",sure tell sir step get thing want night corner reading room come do workmen go finish job time beat ad man do back kitchen take day 
18,"""Well,"" said Horace, evading this point, ""however they've done this, they've done it remarkably well--you'll admit that, Mrs. Rapkin?""",say evade point do do admit 
19,"""That's as may be sir,"" said Mrs. Rapkin, with a sniff, ""but it ain't _my_ taste, nor yet I don't think it will be Rapkin's taste when he comes to see it.""",sir say sniff taste think taste come see 
20,"It was not Ventimore's taste either, though he was not going to confess it. ""Sorry for that, Mrs. Rapkin,"" he said, ""but I've no time to talk about it now. I must rush upstairs and dress.""",taste go confess sorry say have time talk rush dress 
21,"""Begging your pardon, sir, but that's a total unpossibility--for they've been and took away the staircase.'",begg pardon sir total unpossibility take staircase 
22,"""Taken away the staircase? Nonsense!"" cried Horace.",take staircase nonsense cry 
23,"""So _I_ think, Mr. Ventimore--but it's what them men have done, and if you don't believe me, come and see for yourself!""",think man do believe come see 
24,"She drew the hangings aside, and revealed to Ventimore's astonished gaze a vast pillared hall with a lofty domed roof, from which hung several lamps, diffusing a subdued radiance. High up in the wall, on his left, were the two windows which he judged to have formerly belonged to his sitting-room (for either from delicacy or inability, or simply because it had not occurred to him, the Jinnee had not interfered with the external structure), but the windows were now masked by a perforated and gilded lattice, which accounted for the pattern Horace had noticed from without. The walls were covered with blue-and-white Oriental tiles, and a raised platform of alabaster on which were divans ran round two sides of the hall, while the side opposite to him was pierced with horseshoe-shaped arches, apparently leading to other apartments. The centre of the marble floor was spread with costly rugs and piles of cushions, their rich hues glowing through the gold with which they were intricately embroidered.",draw hanging reveal astonished gaze vast pillare hall lofty domed roof hang several lamp diffuse subdued radiance high wall left window judge belong sitting room delicacy inability occur interfer external structure window mask perforate gilded lattice account pattern notice wall cover blue white oriental tile raise platform alabaster divan run side hall side opposite pierce horseshoe shape arche lead other apartment centre marble floor spread costly rug pile cushion rich hue glow gold embroider

26,"""It's not for me to say, sir; but I should like to know where you thought of dining?""",say sir like know think dining

30,"He got rid of her, and, on entering one of the archways, discovered a smaller room, in cedar-wood encrusted with ivory and mother-o'-pearl, which was evidently his bedroom. A gorgeous robe, stiff with gold and glittering with ancient gems, was laid out for him--for the Jinnee had thought of everything--but Ventimore, naturally, preferred his own evening clothes.",get rid enter archway discover small room cedar wood encrust ivory mother o' pearl bedroom gorgeous robe stiff gold glittering ancient gem lay think prefer own evening clothes 
31,"""Mr. Rapkin!"" he shouted, going to another arch that seemed to communicate with the basement.",shout go arch seem communicate basement 
32,"""Sir?"" replied his landlord, who had just returned from his ""reading-room,"" and now appeared, without a tie and in his shirt-sleeves, looking pale and wild, as was, perhaps, intelligible in the circumstances. As he entered his unfamiliar marble halls he staggered, and his red eyes rolled and his mouth gaped in a cod-like fashion. ""They've been at it 'ere, too, seemin'ly,"" he remarked huskily.",reply landlord return reading room appear tie shirt sleeve look pale wild intelligible circumstance enter unfamiliar marble hall stagger red eye roll mouth gape cod-like fashion remark

39,"""Now, look here,"" said Ventimore, sharply--for it was obvious that Mr. Rapkin's studies had been lightened by copious refreshment--""pull yourself together, man, and listen to me.""",look say obvious study lighten copious refreshment pull listen 
40,"""I respeckfully decline to pull myshelf togerrer f'r anybody livin',"" said Mr. Rapkin, with a noble air. ""I shtan' 'ere upon my dignity as a man, sir.

41,"""You can stand on anything you like--or can,"" said Horace; ""but hear what I've got to say. The--the people who made all these alterations went beyond my instructions. I never wanted the house interfered with like this. Still, if your landlord doesn't see that its value is immensely improved, he's a fool, that's all. Anyway, I'll take care _you_ shan't suffer.

43,"""Of course you are,"" said Horace genially, ""and I'll tell you how you're going to show it. You're going straight downstairs to get your good wife to pour some cold water over your head; and then you will finish dressing, see what you can do to get a table of some sort and lay it for dinner, and be ready to announce my friends when they arrive, and wait afterwards. Do you see?""",course say tell go show go get good wife pour cold water head finish dress see do get table sort lay dinner ready announce friend arrive wait see 
44,"""That will be all ri', Mr. Ventimore,"" said Rapkin, who was not far gone enough to be beyond understanding or obeying. ""You leave it entirely to me. I'll unnertake that your friends shall be made comforrable, perfelly comforrable.

Rapkin would be sober enough after his head had been under the tap for a few minutes, and in any case there would be the hired waiter to rely upon.",assurance stumble leave relieve extent sober head tap few minute case be hire waiter rely 
46,"If he could only find out where his evening clothes were! He returned to his room and made another frantic search--but they were nowhere to be found; and as he could not bring himself to receive his guests in his ordinary morning costume--which the Professor would probably construe as a deliberate slight, and which would certainly seem a solecism in Mrs. Futvoye's eyes, if not in her daughter's--he decided to put on the Eastern robes, with the exception of a turban, which he could not manage to wind round his head.",find evening clothes return room make frantic search find bring receive guest ordinary morning costume construe deliberate slight seem solecism eye daughter decide put eastern robe exception turban manage wind head 
47,"Thus arrayed he re-entered the domed hall, where he was annoyed to find that no attempt had been made as yet to prepare a dinner-table, and he was just looking forlornly round for a bell when Rapkin appeared. He had apparently followed Horace's advice, for his hair looked wet and sleek, and he was comparatively sober.",array re-enter domed hall annoy find attempt make prepare dinner table look bell appear follow advice hair look wet sleek sober 
48,"""This is too bad!"" cried Horace; ""my friends may be here at any moment now--and nothing done.

55,"There was a knock, as he spoke, at the front door; and odd enough was the familiar sound of the cast-iron knocker in that Arabian hall.",be knock speak front door odd familiar sound cast iron knocker arabian hall 
56,"""There they are!"" he said, and the idea of meeting them at the door and proposing an instant adjournment to a restaurant occurred to him--till he suddenly recollected that he would have to change and try to find some money, even for that. ""For the last time, Rapkin,"" he cried in despair, ""do you mean to tell me there's no dinner ready?""",say idea meet door propose instant adjournment restaurant occur recollect have change try find money last time cry despair mean tell be dinner ready

60,"He went out by the farther archway, while from the entrance-hall Horace could hear voices he knew only too well. The Futvoyes had come; well, at all events, it seemed that there would be something for them to eat, since Fakrash, in his anxiety to do the thing thoroughly, had furnished both the feast and attendance himself--but who was there to announce the guests? Where were these waiters Rapkin had spoken of? Ought he to go and bring in his visitors himself?",go far archway entrance hall hear voice know come event seem be eat anxiety do thing furnish feast attendance announce guest waiter speak ought go bring visitor 
61,"These questions answered themselves the next instant, for, as he stood there under the dome, the curtains of the central arch were drawn with a rattle, and disclosed a double line of tall slaves in rich raiment, their onyx eyes rolling and their teeth flashing in their chocolate-hued countenances, as they salaamed.",question answer next instant stand dome curtain central arch draw rattle disclose double line tall slave rich raiment onyx eye roll tooth flash chocolate hued countenance salaam

63,"Horace advanced to receive them; he felt he was in for it now, and the only course left him was to put as good a face as he could on the matter, and trust to luck to pull him through without discovery or disaster.",advance receive feel only course leave put good face matter trust luck pull discovery disaster
