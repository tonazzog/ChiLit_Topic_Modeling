4," Lady Harriet was confined to bed for several days after Frank's departure from home, and during all that week Harry and Laura felt so melancholy, that even Mrs. Crabtree became sorry for them, saying it was quite distressing to see how quiet and good they had become, for Master Harry was as mild as milk now, and she almost wished he would be at some of his old tricks again.",confine bed several day departure home week feel melancholy become sorry say distressing see quiet good become mild milk wish old trick 
5,"On the following Monday, a message arrived from Lady Rockville, to say that she was going a long drive in her phaeton, to visit some boys at Musselburgh school, and would be happy to take Harry and Laura of the party, if their grandmama had no objection. None being made by anybody, they flew up stairs to get ready, while Harry did not take above three steps at a time, and Laura, when she followed, felt quite astonished to find Mrs. Crabtree looking almost as pleased as herself, and saying she hoped the expedition would do them both good.",follow message arrive say go long drive phaeton visit boy school happy take party grandmama have objection make fly stair get ready take step time follow feel astonished find look pleased say hope expedition do good 
6,"Before five minutes had elapsed, Harry was mounted on the dickey, where Lady Rockville desired him to sit, instead of the footman, who was now dismissed, as no room could be made for both; so after that Harry touched his hat whenever any of the party spoke to him, as if he had really been the servant.",minute elapse mount dickey desire sit footman dismiss room make touch hat party speak servant 
7,"Laura, meanwhile, was placed between Lady Rockville and Miss Perceval, where she could hardly keep quiet a minute for joy, though afraid to turn her head or to stir her little finger, in case of being thought troublesome.",place keep quiet minute joy afraid turn head stir little finger case think troublesome 
8,"""I am told that the races take place at Musselburgh to-day,"" said Lady Rockville. ""It is a cruel amusement, derived from the sufferings of noble animals; they have as good a right to be happy in the world as ourselves, Laura; but we shall pass that way, so Harry and you will probably see the crowds of carriages.""",tell race take place day say cruel amusement derive suffering noble animal have good right happy world pass way see crowd carriage

10,"""Hurra!"" exclaimed Harry, clapping his hands; ""what a delightful surprise! Oh! I am so dreadfully happy!""",exclaim clap hand delightful surprise happy 
11,"""After all, my dear Lady Rockville,"" said Miss Perceval, yawning, ""what have horses got legs for, except to run?""",dear say yawning horse get leg run 
12,"""Yes, but not at such a pace! It always shocked me--formerly at Doncaster, where the jockeys were sometimes paid £1000 for winning--to see how the poor animals were lashed and spurred along the course, foaming with fatigue, gasping till they nearly expired. Horses, poor creatures, from the hour of their birth till their death, have a sad time of it!""",pace shock jockey pay win see poor animal lash spur course foam fatigue gasp expire horse poor creature hour birth death have sad time 
13,"""Grandmama once read me a beautiful description of a wild horse in his natural state of liberty,"" said Laura. ""Among the South American forests he was to be seen carrying his head erect, with sparkling eyes, flowing mane, and splendid tail, trotting about among the noble trees, or cropping the grass at his feet, looking quite princely, and doing precisely what he pleased.""",read beautiful description wild horse natural state liberty say american forest see carry head erect sparkling eye flow mane splendid tail trot noble tree cropp grass foot look princely do pleased 
14,"""Then look at the contrast,"" said Lady Rockville, pointing to a long row of cart-horses with galled sides, shrivelled skins, broken knees, and emaciated bodies, which were all dragging their weary load along. ""Animals are all meant for the use of man, but not to be abused, like these poor creatures!""",look contrast say point long row cart horse galled side shrivell skin break knee emaciated body drag weary load animal mean use man abuse poor creature 
15,"""As for racing,"" said Miss Perceval, ""a thorough-bred horse enters into the spirit of it quite as much as his rider. Did you never hear of Quin's celebrated steed, which became so eager to win, that when his antagonist passed he seized him violently by the leg, and both jockeys had to dismount that the furious animal might be torn away. The famous horse Forester, too, caught hold of his opponent by the jaw, and could scarcely be disengaged.""",racing say thorough breed horse enter spirit much rider hear celebrate steed become eager win antagonist pass seize leg jockey have dismount furious animal tear famous horse catch hold opponent jaw disengage 
16,"""Think of all the cruel training these poor creatures went through before they came to that,"" added Lady Rockville; ""of the way in which horses are beaten, spurred, and severely cut with the whip; then, after their strength fails, like the well-known 'high-mettled racer,' the poor animal is probably sold at last to perpetual hard labour and ill-usage.""",think cruel training poor creature go come add way horse beat spur cut whip strength fail know high mettle racer poor animal sell last perpetual hard labour ill usage 
17,"""Uncle David shewed me yesterday,"" said Laura, ""that horrid picture which you have probably seen, by Cruickshanks, of the Knackers' Yards in London, where old horses are sent to end their miserable days, after it is impossible to torture them any longer into working. Oh! it was dreadful! and yet grandmama said the whole sketch had been taken from life.""",shew yesterday say horrid picture see old horse send end miserable day impossible torture work dreadful grandmama say whole sketch take life 
18,"""I know that,"" answered Lady Rockville. ""In these places the wretched animals are literally put to death by starvation, and may be seen gnawing each other's manes in the last agonies of hunger.""",know answer place wretch animal put death starvation see gnaw other mane last agony hunger 
19,"""My dear Lady Rockville,"" exclaimed Miss Perceval, affectedly, ""how can you talk of such unpleasant things!--there is an Act of Parliament against cruelty to animals, so of course no such thing exists now. Many gentlemen are vastly kind to old horses, turning them out to grass for years, that they may enjoy a life of elegant leisure and rural retirement, to which, no doubt, some are well entitled; for instance, the famous horse Eclipse, which gained his owner £25,000! I wish he had been mine!""",dear exclaim talk such unpleasant thing be act cruelty animal course such thing exist many gentleman kind old horse turn grass year enjoy life elegant leisure rural retirement doubt entitle instance famous horse gain owner wish 
20,"""But think how many are ruined when one is enriched, and indeed both are ruined in morals and good feeling; therefore I am glad that our sex have never yet taken to the turf. It is bad enough, my dear Miss Perceval, to see that they have taken to the moors; for were I to say all I think of those amazons who lately killed their six brace of grouse on the 12th of August, they would probably challenge me to single combat. Lord Rockville says, 'What with gentlemen doing worsted work, and ladies shouldering double-barrelled guns, he scarcely thinks this can be the same world he was born in long ago.'""",think many ruin enrich ruin moral good feeling glad sex take turf bad dear see take moor say think amazon kill brace grouse 12th challenge single combat say gentleman do worsted work lady shoulder double barrell gun think same world bear 
21,"The carriage, at this moment, began to proceed along the road with such extraordinary rapidity, that there seemed no danger of their following in the dust of any other equipage, and Miss Perceval became exceedingly alarmed, especially when Lady Rockville mentioned that this was one of the first times she had been driven by her new coachman, who seemed so very unsteady on his seat, she had felt apprehensive, for some time, that he might be drunk.",carriage moment begin proceed road such extraordinary rapidity seem danger follow dust other equipage become alarmed mention first time drive new coachman seem unsteady seat feel apprehensive time drunk 
22,"""A tipsy coachman! Dear Lady Rockville, do let me out! We shall certainly be killed in this crowd of carriages! I can walk home! Pray stop him, Miss Laura! I came to look on at a race, but not to run one myself! This fast driving is like a railroad, only not quite so straight! I do verily believe we are run off with! Stop, coachman!--stop!""",tipsy coachman dear let kill crowd carriage walk pray stop come look race run fast driving railroad straight believe run stop coachman stop 
23,"In spite of all Miss Perceval's exclamations and vociferations, the carriage flew on with frightful rapidity, though it reeled from side to side of the road, as if it had become intoxicated like the driver himself, who lashed his horses and galloped along, within an inch of hedges and ditches all the way, till at last, having reached the race-course, he pulled up so suddenly and violently, that the horses nearly fell back on their haunches, while he swore at them in the most furious and shocking manner.",spite exclamation vociferation carriage fly frightful rapidity reel side side road become intoxicated driver lash horse gallop inch hedge ditch way last reach race course pull horse fall haunch swore furious shocking manner 
24,"Lady Rockville now stood up, and spoke to the coachman very severely on his misconduct, in first driving her so dangerously fast, and then being disrespectful enough to use profane language in her presence, adding, that if he did not conduct himself more properly, she must complain to Lord Rockville as soon as the carriage returned home. Upon hearing this, the man looked exceedingly sulky, and muttered angrily to himself in a tipsy voice, till at last he suddenly threw away the reins, and, rising from the box, he began to scramble his way down, nearly falling to the ground in his haste, and saying, ""if your ladyship is not pleased with my driving, you may drive yourself!""",stand speak coachman misconduct drive disrespectful use profane language presence add conduct complain carriage return hear man look sulky mutter tipsy voice last throw rein rise box begin scramble way fall ground haste say ladyship pleased driving drive 
25,"After this the intoxicated man staggered towards a drinking-booth not far off, and disappeared, leaving Miss Perceval perfectly planet-struck with astonishment, and actually dumb during several minutes with wonder, at all she heard and saw. There sat Harry, alone on the dicky, behind two spirited blood-horses, foaming at the mouth with the speed at which they had come, and ready to start off again at the slightest hint, while noises on every side were to be heard enough to frighten a pair of hobby-horses. Piemen ringing their bells--blind fiddlers playing out of tune--boys calling lists of the horses--drums beating at the starting-post--ballad singers squalling at the full pitch of their voices--horses galloping--grooms quarrelling--dogs barking--and children crying.",intoxicated man stagger drinking booth disappear leave planet strike astonishment dumb several minute wonder hear see sit dicky spirit blood horse foam mouth speed come ready start slight hint noise side hear frighten pair hobby horse ring bell blind fiddler play tune boy call list horse drum beat starting post ballad singer squall full pitch voice horse gallop groom quarrell dog bark child cry 
26,"In the midst of all this uproar, Harry unexpectedly observed Captain Digby on horseback not far off. Without losing a moment, he stood up, waving his handkerchief, and calling to beg he would come to the carriage immediately, as they were in want of assistance; and Lady Rockville told, as soon as he arrived, though hardly able to help laughing while she explained it, the extraordinary predicament they had been placed in. Captain Digby, upon hearing the story, looked ready to go off like a squib with rage at the offending coachman, and instantly seizing the driving-whip, he desired his servant to hold the horses' heads, while he proceeded towards the drinking-booth, flourishing the long lash in his hand as he went in a most ominous manner. Several minutes elapsed, during which Harry overheard a prodigious outcry in the tent, and then the drunken coachman was seen reeling away along the road, while Captain Digby, still brandishing the whip, returned, and mounting the dicky himself, he gathered up the reins, and insisted on driving Lady Rockville's phaeton for her. Before long it was ranged close beside a chariot so full of ladies, it seemed ready to burst, when Harry was amused to perceive that Peter Grey and another boy, who were seated on the rumble behind, had spread a table-cloth on the roof of the carriage, using it for a dining-table, while they all seemed determined to astonish their appetites by the quantity of oysters and sandwiches they ate, and by drinking at the same time large tumblers of porter. Lady Rockville wished she could have the loan of Harry and Laura's spirits for an hour or two, when she saw how perfectly bewildered with delight they were on beholding the thousands of eager persons assembled on the race-ground,--jockeys riding about in liveries as gay as tulips--officers in scarlet uniform--red flags fluttering in the breeze--caravans exhibiting pictures of the wildest-looking beasts in the world--bands of music--recruiting parties--fire-eaters, who dined on red-hot pokers--portraits representing pigs fatter than the fattest in the world--giants a head and three pair of shoulders taller than any one else, and little dwarfs, scarcely visible with the naked eye--all of which were shown to children for half price!",midst uproar observe horseback lose moment stand wave handkerchief call beg come carriage want assistance tell arrive able help laugh explain extraordinary predicament place hear story look ready go squib rage offend coachman seize driving whip desire servant hold horse head proceed drinking booth flourish long lash hand go ominous manner several minute elapse overhear prodigious outcry tent drunken coachman see reel road brandish whip return mount dicky gather rein insist drive phaeton rang chariot full lady seem ready burst amuse perceive boy seat rumble spread table cloth roof carriage use dining table seem determined astonish appetite quantity oyster sandwich eat drink same time large tumbler porter wish have loan spirit hour see bewilder delight behold thousand eager person assemble race ground jockey ride livery gay tulip officer scarlet uniform red flag flutter breeze caravan exhibit picture wild look beast world band music recruiting party fire eater dine red hot poker portrait represent pig fatter fattest world giant head pair shoulder tall one else little dwarf visible naked eye show child half price 
27,"Lady Rockville very good naturedly gave Harry half-a-crown, promising that, before leaving the race-ground, he should either buy some oranges to lay the dust in his throat after so long a drive, or visit as many shows as he pleased for his half-crown; and they were anxiously discussing what five sights would be worth sixpence each, when a loud hurra was heard, the drums beat, and five horses started off for the first heat. Harry stood up in an ecstacy of delight, and spoke loudly in admiration of the jockey on a grey horse, with a pink jacket, who took the lead, and seemed perfectly to fly, as if he need never touch the ground; but Harry exclaimed angrily against the next rider, in a yellow dress and green cap, who pulled back his own bay horse, as if he really wished to lose. To Laura's astonishment, however, Captain Digby preferred him, and Miss Perceval declared in favour of a light-blue jacket and chesnut horse. Harry now thought everybody stupid not to agree with him, and called out in the height of his eagerness, ""I would bet this half-crown upon the pink jacket!""",good give half crown promise leave race ground buy orange lay dust throat drive visit many show pleased half crown discuss sight worth loud hurra hear drum beat horse start first heat stand ecstacy delight speak admiration jockey grey horse pink jacket take lead seem fly touch ground exclaim next rider yellow dress green cap pull own bay horse wish lose astonishment prefer declare favour light blue jacket chesnut horse think stupid agree call height eagerness bet half crown pink jacket 
28,"""Done!"" cried Peter, laughing. ""The yellow dress and green cap for my money!""",do cry laugh yellow dress green cap money 
29,"""Then I shall soon have five shillings!"" exclaimed Harry in great glee; but scarcely had he spoken, before a loud murmuring sound arose among the surrounding crowd, upon hearing which he looked anxiously about, and was astonished to see the green cap and yellow dress already at the winning-post, while his own favourite grey horse cantered slowly along, far behind all the others, carrying the jockey in the pink jacket, who hung his head, and was bent nearly double, with shame and fatigue.",have shilling exclaim great glee speak loud murmure sound arise surround crowd hear look astonished see green cap yellow dress win post own favourite grey horse canter other carry jockey pink jacket hang head bend double shame fatigue 
30,"Peter Grey gave a loud laugh of triumph when he glanced at Harry's disappointed angry countenance, and held out his hand for the half-crown, saying, ""Pay your debt of honour, Master Harry! It is rather fortunate I won, seeing that not one sixpence had I to have paid you with! not a penny to jingle on a mile-stone. You had more money than wit, and I had more wit than money, so we are well met. Did you not see that the grey horse had fallen lame? Good-bye, youngster! I shall tell all the giants and wild beasts to expect you another day!""",give loud laugh triumph glance disappoint angry countenance hold hand half crown say pay debt honour master fortunate win see sixpence have pay penny jingle mile stone have more money wit have more wit money meet see grey horse fall lame good youngster tell giant wild beast expect day 
31,"""Harry!"" said Lady Rockville, looking gravely at his enraged countenance, ""it is a foolish fish that is caught with every bait! I am quite relieved that you lost that money. This is an early lesson against gambling, and no one can ever be rich or happy who becomes fond of it. We were wrong to bring you here at all; and I now see you could easily be led into that dreadful vice, which has caused misery and ruin to thousands of young men. If you had possessed an estate, it would have been thrown away quite as foolishly as the poor half-crown, making you perhaps miserable afterwards for life.""",say look enrage countenance foolish fish catch bait relieved lose money early lesson gambling rich happy become fond wrong bring see lead dreadful vice cause misery ruin thousand young man possess estate throw poor half crown make miserable life 
32,"""I thought myself quite sure to win!"" exclaimed Harry, still looking with angry astonishment after Peter, who was making odd grimaces, and holding up the half-crown in a most teazing manner. ""I would rather have thrown my money into the sea than given it to Peter.""",think sure win exclaim look angry astonishment make odd grimace hold half crown teazing manner throw money sea give 
33,"""Think, too, how many pleasanter and better ways there are, in which you might have spent it!"" added Lady Rockville. ""Look at that poor blind man whom you could have relieved, or consider what a nice present you should have given to Laura! But there seem to be no more brains in your head, Harry, than in her thimble!""",think many pleasanter good way spend add look poor blind man relieve consider nice present give seem be more brain head thimble 
34,"""Peter is quite a little black-leg already,"" observed Miss Perceval. ""I never saw such a boy! So fond of attracting notice, that he would put on a cap and bells if that would make him stared at. Last Saturday he undertook for a bet to make a ceremonious bow to every lamp-post along Prince's Street, and I wish you could have seen the wondering crowd that gradually collected as he went along, performing his task with the most perfect composure and impudence.""",little black leg observe see boy fond attract notice put cap bell make stare last undertake bet make ceremonious bow lamp post wish see wonder crowd collect go perform task perfect composure impudence 
35,"""For cool assurance, I hope there are not many boys equal to him,"" said Lady Rockville. ""He scattered out of the window lately several red-hot half-pence, among some beggars, and I am told they perfectly stuck to the poor creatures' fingers when trying to pick them up; and he was sent a message, on his pony, one very cold day lately, to Lady De Vere's, who offered, when he was taking leave, to cut him one of her finest camellias, to which he replied, 'I would much rather you offered me a hot potatoe!'""",cool assurance hope be many boy equal say scatter window several red hot half pence beggar tell stick poor creature finger try pick send message pony cold day offer take leave cut fine camellias reply offer hot potatoe 
36,"""Peter feels no sympathy in your disappointment, Harry,"" added Miss Perceval; ""but we might as well expect wool on a dog, as friendship from a gambler, who would ruin his own father, and always laughs at those who lose.""",feel sympathy disappointment add expect wool dog friendship gambler ruin own father laugh lose 
37,"""Go and cut your wisdom teeth, Harry!"" said Captain Digby, smiling. ""Any one must have been born blind not to observe that the grey horse was falling behind; but you have bought half-a-crown's worth of wisdom by experience, and I hope it will last for life. Never venture to bet even that your own head is on your shoulders, or it may turn out a mistake.""",go cut wisdom tooth say smile one bear blind observe grey horse fall buy half crown worth wisdom experience hope last life venture bet own head shoulder turn mistake 
38,"""Harry is now the monkey that has seen the world, and I think it will be a whole year of Saturdays before he ever commits such a blunder again,"" continued Lady Rockville. ""We must for this once, not complain of what has occurred to Lady Harriet, because she would be exceedingly displeased, but certainly you are a most ingenious little gentleman for getting into scrapes!""",monkey see world think whole year commit blunder continue complain occur displeased ingenious little gentleman get scrape 
39,"Harry told upon himself, however, on his return home, because he had always been accustomed to do so, knowing Major Graham and his grandmama were never very angry at any fault that was confessed and repented of, therefore he went straight up stairs, and related his whole history to uncle David, who gave him a very serious exhortation against the foolish and sinful vice of gambling. To keep him in mind of his silly adventure that day, Harry was also desired, during the whole evening, to wear his coat turned inside out, a very frequent punishment administered by Major Graham for small offences, and which was generally felt to be a terrible disgrace.",tell return accustom do know grandmama angry fault confess repent go stair relate whole history uncle give serious exhortation foolish sinful vice gambling keep mind silly adventure day desire whole evening wear coat turn frequent punishment administer small offence feel terrible disgrace
