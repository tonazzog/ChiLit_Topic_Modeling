3,"As the boys scattered away from the ground, and East, leaning on Tom’s arm, and limping along, was beginning to consider what luxury they should go and buy for tea to celebrate that glorious victory, the two Brookes came striding by. Old Brooke caught sight of East, and stopped; put his hand kindly on his shoulder, and said, “Bravo, youngster; you played famously. Not much the matter, I hope?”",boy scatter ground lean arm limp begin consider luxury go buy tea celebrate glorious victory come strid old catch sight stop put hand shoulder say youngster play matter hope

5,"“Well, mind and get all right for next Saturday.” And the leader passed on, leaving East better for those few words than all the opodeldoc in England would have made him, and Tom ready to give one of his ears for as much notice. Ah! light words of those whom we love and honour, what a power ye are, and how carelessly wielded by those who can use you! Surely for these things also God will ask an account.",mind get right next leader pass leave good few word opodeldoc make ready give ear much notice light word love honour power wield use thing ask account 
6,"“Tea’s directly after locking-up, you see,” said East, hobbling along as fast as he could, “so you come along down to Sally Harrowell’s; that’s our School-house tuck-shop. She bakes such stunning murphies, we’ll have a penn’orth each for tea. Come along, or they’ll all be gone.”",tea lock see say hobble come school house tuck shop bake such stunning murphie have penn’orth tea come gone 
7,"Tom’s new purse and money burnt in his pocket; he wondered, as they toddled through the quadrangle and along the street, whether East would be insulted if he suggested further extravagance, as he had not sufficient faith in a pennyworth of potatoes. At last he blurted out,--",new purse money burn pocket wonder toddle quadrangle street insult suggest further extravagance have sufficient faith pennyworth potato last blurt 
8,"“I say, East, can’t we get something else besides potatoes? I’ve got lots of money, you know.”",say get else potato get lot money know 
9,"“Bless us, yes; I forgot,” said East, “you’ve only just come. You see all my tin’s been gone this twelve weeks--it hardly ever lasts beyond the first fortnight; and our allowances were all stopped this morning for broken windows, so I haven’t got a penny. I’ve got a tick at Sally’s, of course; but then I hate running it high, you see, towards the end of the half, ‘cause one has to shell out for it all directly one comes back, and that’s a bore.”",bless forget say come see tin go week last first fortnight allowance stop morning break window get penny get tick course hate run high see end half have shell come bore 
10,"Tom didn’t understand much of this talk, but seized on the fact that East had no money, and was denying himself some little pet luxury in consequence. “Well, what shall I buy?” said he, “I’m uncommon hungry.”",understand much talk seize fact have money deny little pet luxury consequence buy say uncommon hungry 
11,"“I say,” said East, stopping to look at him and rest his leg, “you’re a trump, Brown. I’ll do the same by you next half. Let’s have a pound of sausages then. That’s the best grub for tea I know of.”",say say stop look rest leg trump do same next half let have pound sausages good grub tea know 
12,"“Very well,” said Tom, as pleased as possible; “where do they sell them?”",say pleased possible sell 
13,"“Oh, over here, just opposite.” And they crossed the street and walked into the cleanest little front room of a small house, half parlour, half shop, and bought a pound of most particular sausages, East talking pleasantly to Mrs. Porter while she put them in paper, and Tom doing the paying part.",opposite cross street walk clean little front room small house half parlour half shop buy pound most particular sausages talk put paper do pay part 
14,"From Porter’s they adjourned to Sally Harrowell’s, where they found a lot of School-house boys waiting for the roast potatoes, and relating their own exploits in the day’s match at the top of their voices. The street opened at once into Sally’s kitchen, a low brick-floored room, with large recess for fire, and chimney-corner seats. Poor little Sally, the most good-natured and much-enduring of womankind, was bustling about, with a napkin in her hand, from her own oven to those of the neighbours’ cottages up the yard at the back of the house. Stumps, her husband, a short, easy-going shoemaker, with a beery, humorous eye and ponderous calves, who lived mostly on his wife’s earnings, stood in a corner of the room, exchanging shots of the roughest description of repartee with every boy in turn. “Stumps, you lout, you’ve had too much beer again to-day.” “‘Twasn’t of your paying for, then.” “Stumps’s calves are running down into his ankles; they want to get to grass.”  “Better be doing that than gone altogether like yours,” etc. Very poor stuff it was, but it served to make time pass; and every now and then Sally arrived in the middle with a smoking tin of potatoes, which was cleared off in a few seconds, each boy as he seized his lot running off to the house with “Put me down two-penn’orth, Sally;” “Put down three-penn’orth between me and Davis,” etc. How she ever kept the accounts so straight as she did, in her head and on her slate, was a perfect wonder.",adjourn find lot school house boy wait roast potato relate own exploit day match top voice street open kitchen low brick floor room large recess fire chimney corner seat poor little good natured endure womankind bustle napkin hand own oven neighbour cottage yard back house stump husband short easy go shoemaker beery humorous eye ponderous calve live wife earnings stand corner room exchang shot roughest description repartee boy turn stump lout have much beer day twa pay stump calve run ankle want get grass do go etc. poor stuff serve make time pass arrive middle smoking tin potato clear few second boy seize lot run house put penn’orth put penn’orth etc. keep account straight head slate perfect wonder 
15,"East and Tom got served at last, and started back for the School-house, just as the locking-up bell began to ring, East on the way recounting the life and adventures of Stumps, who was a character. Amongst his other small avocations, he was the hind carrier of a sedan-chair, the last of its race, in which the Rugby ladies still went out to tea, and in which, when he was fairly harnessed and carrying a load, it was the delight of small and mischievous boys to follow him and whip his calves. This was too much for the temper even of Stumps, and he would pursue his tormentors in a vindictive and apoplectic manner when released, but was easily pacified by twopence to buy beer with.",serve last start house locking bell begin ring way recount life adventure character other small avocation hind carrier sedan chair last race lady go tea harness carry load delight small mischievous boy follow whip calve much temper pursue tormentor vindictive apoplectic manner release pacify twopence buy beer 
16,"The lower-school boys of the School-house, some fifteen in number, had tea in the lower-fifth school, and were presided over by the old verger or head-porter. Each boy had a quarter of a loaf of bread and pat of butter, and as much tea as he pleased; and there was scarcely one who didn’t add to this some further luxury, such as baked potatoes, a herring, sprats, or something of the sort. But few at this period of the half-year could live up to a pound of Porter’s sausages, and East was in great magnificence upon the strength of theirs. He had produced a toasting-fork from his study, and set Tom to toast the sausages, while he mounted guard over their butter and potatoes. “‘Cause,” as he explained, “you’re a new boy, and they’ll play you some trick and get our butter; but you can toast just as well as I.” So Tom, in the midst of three or four more urchins similarly employed, toasted his face and the sausages at the same time before the huge fire, till the latter cracked; when East from his watch-tower shouted that they were done, and then the feast proceeded, and the festive cups of tea were filled and emptied, and Tom imparted of the sausages in small bits to many neighbours, and thought he had never tasted such good potatoes or seen such jolly boys. They on their parts waived all ceremony, and pegged away at the sausages and potatoes, and remembering Tom’s performance in goal, voted East’s new crony a brick. After tea, and while the things were being cleared away, they gathered round the fire, and the talk on the match still went on; and those who had them to show pulled up their trousers and showed the hacks they had received in the good cause.",low school boy house number have tea low fifth school preside old verger head porter boy have quarter loaf bread pat butter much tea pleased be add further luxury such bake potato herring sprat sort few period half year live pound sausages great magnificence strength produce toasting fork study set toast sausages mount guard butter potato explain new boy play trick get butter toast midst more urchin employ toast face sausages same time huge fire latter crack watch tower shout do feast proceed festive cup tea fill empty impart sausages small bit many neighbour think taste such good potato see such jolly boy part waive ceremony peg sausages potato remember performance goal vote new crony brick tea thing clear gather fire talk match go have show pull trousers show hack receive good cause 
17,"They were soon, however, all turned out of the school; and East conducted Tom up to his bedroom, that he might get on clean things, and wash himself before singing.",turn school conduct bedroom get clean thing wash sing 
18,"“What’s singing?” said Tom, taking his head out of his basin, where he had been plunging it in cold water.",sing say take head basin plung cold water 
19,"“Well, you are jolly green,” answered his friend, from a neighbouring basin. “Why, the last six Saturdays of every half we sing of course; and this is the first of them. No first lesson to do, you know, and lie in bed to-morrow morning.”",jolly green answer friend neighbour basin last saturday half sing course first first lesson do know lie bed morning 
20,“But who sings?”,sing 
21,"“Why, everybody, of course; you’ll see soon enough. We begin directly after supper, and sing till bed-time. It ain’t such good fun now, though, as in the summer half; ‘cause then we sing in the little fives court, under the library, you know. We take out tables, and the big boys sit round and drink beer--double allowance on Saturday nights; and we cut about the quadrangle between the songs, and it looks like a lot of robbers in a cave. And the louts come and pound at the great gates, and we pound back again, and shout at them. But this half we only sing in the hall.

23,"Supper came in due course at seven o’clock, consisting of bread and cheese and beer, which was all saved for the singing; and directly afterwards the fags went to work to prepare the hall. The School-house hall, as has been said, is a great long high room, with two large fires on one side, and two large iron-bound tables, one running down the middle, and the other along the wall opposite the fireplaces. Around the upper fire the fags placed the tables in the form of a horse-shoe, and upon them the jugs with the Saturday night’s allowance of beer. Then the big boys used to drop in and take their seats, bringing with them bottled beer and song books; for although they all knew the songs by heart, it was the thing to have an old manuscript book descended from some departed hero, in which they were all carefully written out.",supper come due course o'clock consist bread cheese beer save singing fag go work prepare hall house hall say great long high room large fire side large iron bound table run middle other wall fireplace upper fire fag place table form horse shoe jug night allowance beer big boy use drop take seat bring bottled beer song book know song heart thing have old manuscript book descend depart hero write 
24,"The sixth-form boys had not yet appeared; so, to fill up the gap, an interesting and time-honoured ceremony was gone through. Each new boy was placed on the table in turn, and made to sing a solo, under the penalty of drinking a large mug of salt and water if he resisted or broke down. However, the new boys all sing like nightingales to-night, and the salt water is not in requisition--Tom, as his part, performing the old west-country song of “The Leather Bottel” with considerable applause. And at the half-hour down come the sixth and fifth form boys, and take their places at the tables, which are filled up by the next biggest boys, the rest, for whom there is no room at the table, standing round outside.",sixth form boy appear fill gap interesting time honoure ceremony go new boy place table turn make sing solo penalty drink large mug salt water resist break new boy sing nightingale night salt water requisition part perform old west country song considerable applause half hour come sixth fifth form boy take place table fill next big boy rest be room table stand

And then follow “The British Grenadiers,” “Billy Taylor,” “The Siege of Seringapatam,”  “Three Jolly Postboys,” and other vociferous songs in rapid succession, including “The Chesapeake and Shannon,” a song lately introduced in honour of old Brooke; and when they come to the words,",invariable first song house voice join mindful harmony bend noise attain general effect bad follow british other vociferous song rapid succession include song introduce honour old come word

The fourth form are uncertain in their belief, but for the most part hold that old Brooke was a midshipman then on board his uncle’s ship. And the lower school never doubt for a moment that it was our old Brooke who led the boarders, in what capacity they care not a straw. During the pauses the bottled-beer corks fly rapidly, and the talk is fast and merry, and the big boys--at least all of them who have a fellow-feeling for dry throats--hand their mugs over their shoulders to be emptied by the small ones who stand round behind.",expect roof come sixth fifth know brave break sort relation old fourth form uncertain belief most part hold old midshipman board uncle ship low school doubt moment old lead border capacity care straw pause bottled beer cork fly talk fast merry big boy least have fellow feeling dry throat hand mug shoulder empty small one stand 
30,"Then Warner, the head of the house, gets up and wants to speak; but he can’t, for every boy knows what’s coming. And the big boys who sit at the tables pound them and cheer; and the small boys who stand behind pound one another, and cheer, and rush about the hall cheering. Then silence being made, Warner reminds them of the old School-house custom of drinking the healths, on the first night of singing, of those who are going to leave at the end of the half. “He sees that they know what he is going to say already” (loud cheers), “and so won’t keep them, but only ask them to treat the toast as it deserves.

31,"And away goes the pounding and cheering again, becoming deafening when old Brooke gets on his legs; till, a table having broken down, and a gallon or so of beer been upset, and all throats getting dry, silence ensues, and the hero speaks, leaning his hands on the table, and bending a little forwards. No action, no tricks of oratory--plain, strong, and straight, like his play.",go pounding cheer become deafen old get leg table break gallon beer upset throat get dry silence ensue hero speak lean hand table bending little forward action trick oratory plain strong straight play 
32,"“Gentlemen of the School-house! I am very proud of the way in which you have received my name, and I wish I could say all I should like in return. But I know I shan’t. However, I’ll do the best I can to say what seems to me ought to be said by a fellow who’s just going to leave, and who has spent a good slice of his life here. Eight years it is, and eight such years as I can never hope to have again. So now I hope you’ll all listen to me” (loud cheers of “That we will”), “for I’m going to talk seriously. You’re bound to listen to me for what’s the use of calling me ‘pater,’ and all that, if you don’t mind what I say? And I’m going to talk seriously, because I feel so. It’s a jolly time, too, getting to the end of the half, and a goal kicked by us first day”  (tremendous applause), “after one of the hardest and fiercest day’s play I can remember in eight years.” (Frantic shoutings.) “The School played splendidly, too, I will say, and kept it up to the last. That last charge of theirs would have carried away a house. I never thought to see anything again of old Crab there, except little pieces, when I saw him tumbled over by it.” (Laughter and shouting, and great slapping on the back of Jones by the boys nearest him.) “Well, but we beat ‘em.”  (Cheers.) “Ay, but why did we beat ‘em? Answer me that.” (Shouts of “Your play.”) “Nonsense! ‘Twasn’t the wind and kick-off either--that wouldn’t do it. ‘Twasn’t because we’ve half a dozen of the best players in the school, as we have. I wouldn’t change Warner, and Hedge, and Crab, and the young un, for any six on their side.” (Violent cheers.) “But half a dozen fellows can’t keep it up for two hours against two hundred. Why is it, then? I’ll tell you what I think. It’s because we’ve more reliance on one another, more of a house feeling, more fellowship than the School can have. Each of us knows and can depend on his next-hand man better. That’s why we beat ‘em to-day. We’ve union, they’ve division--there’s the secret.” (Cheers.) “But how’s this to be kept up? How’s it to be improved? That’s the question. For I take it we’re all in earnest about beating the School, whatever else we care about. I know I’d sooner win two School-house matches running than get the Balliol scholarship any day.” (Frantic cheers.)",house proud way receive name wish say like return know do good say seem say fellow go leave spend good slice life year such year hope have hope listen loud cheer go talk bind listen use call pater mind say go talk feel jolly time get end half goal kick first day tremendous applause hard fiercest day play remember year frantic shouting play say keep last last charge carry house think see old crab little piece see tumble laughter shouting great slap back boy near beat cheer beat answer shout play nonsense twa wind kick do twa good player school have change young un side violent cheer fellow keep hour tell think have more reliance more house feeling more fellowship school have know depend next hand man good beat day union division be secret cheer keep improve question take earnest beat care know win school house match run get scholarship day frantic cheer 
33,"“Now, I’m as proud of the house as any one. I believe it’s the best house in the school, out and out.” (Cheers.) “But it’s a long way from what I want to see it. First, there’s a deal of bullying going on. I know it well. I don’t pry about and interfere; that only makes it more underhand, and encourages the small boys to come to us with their fingers in their eyes telling tales, and so we should be worse off than ever. It’s very little kindness for the sixth to meddle generally--you youngsters mind that. You’ll be all the better football players for learning to stand it, and to take your own parts, and fight it through. But depend on it, there’s nothing breaks up a house like bullying. Bullies are cowards, and one coward makes many; so good-bye to the School-house match if bullying gets ahead here.” (Loud applause from the small boys, who look meaningly at Flashman and other boys at the tables.) “Then there’s fuddling about in the public-house, and drinking bad spirits, and punch, and such rot-gut stuff. That won’t make good drop-kicks or chargers of you, take my word for it. You get plenty of good beer here, and that’s enough for you; and drinking isn’t fine or manly, whatever some of you may think of it.",proud house one believe good house school cheer long way want see be deal bullying go know pry interfere make underhand encourage small boy come finger eye tell tale bad little kindness sixth meddle youngster mind good football player learn stand take own part fight depend be break house bullying bully coward coward make many good bye house match bullying get loud applause small boy look other boy table be fuddle public house drink bad spirit punch such rot gut stuff make good drop kick charger take word get plenty good beer enough drinking fine manly think 
34,"“One other thing I must have a word about. A lot of you think and say, for I’ve heard you, ‘There’s this new Doctor hasn’t been here so long as some of us, and he’s changing all the old customs. Rugby, and the Schoolhouse especially, are going to the dogs. Stand up for the good old ways, and down with the Doctor!’ Now I’m as fond of old Rugby customs and ways as any of you, and I’ve been here longer than any of you, and I’ll give you a word of advice in time, for I shouldn’t like to see any of you getting sacked. ‘Down with the Doctor’s’ easier said than done. You’ll find him pretty tight on his perch, I take it, and an awkwardish customer to handle in that line. Besides now, what customs has he put down? There was the good old custom of taking the linchpins out of the farmers’ and bagmen’s gigs at the fairs, and a cowardly, blackguard custom it was. We all know what came of it, and no wonder the Doctor objected to it.

And mind now, I say again, look out for squalls if you will go your own way, and that way ain’t the Doctor’s, for it’ll lead to grief. You all know that I’m not the fellow to back a master through thick and thin. If I saw him stopping football, or cricket, or bathing, or sparring, I’d be as ready as any fellow to stand up about it. But he don’t; he encourages them. Didn’t you see him out to-day for half an hour watching us?” (loud cheers for the Doctor); “and he’s a strong, true man, and a wise one too, and a public-school man too” (cheers), “and so let’s stick to him, and talk no more rot, and drink his health as the head of the house.”  (Loud cheers.) “And now I’ve done blowing up, and very glad I am to have done. But it’s a solemn thing to be thinking of leaving a place which one has lived in and loved for eight years; and if one can say a word for the good of the old house at such a time, why, it should be said, whether bitter or sweet. If I hadn’t been proud of the house and you--ay, no one knows how proud--I shouldn’t be blowing you up. And now let’s get to singing. But before I sit down I must give you a toast to be drunk with three-times-three and all the honours. It’s a toast which I hope every one of us, wherever he may go hereafter, will never fail to drink when he thinks of the brave, bright days of his boyhood.

40,"The last few words hit the audience in their weakest place. They had been not altogether enthusiastic at several parts of old Brooke’s speech; but “the best house of the best school in England” was too much for them all, and carried even the sporting and drinking interests off their legs into rapturous applause, and (it is to be hoped) resolutions to lead a new life and remember old Brooke’s words--which, however, they didn’t altogether do, as will appear hereafter.",last few word hit audience weak place enthusiastic several part old speech good house good school much carry sport drinking interest leg rapturous applause hope resolution lead new life remember old word do appear 
41,"But it required all old Brooke’s popularity to carry down parts of his speech--especially that relating to the Doctor. For there are no such bigoted holders by established forms and customs, be they never so foolish or meaningless, as English school-boys--at least, as the school-boys of our generation. We magnified into heroes every boy who had left, and looked upon him with awe and reverence when he revisited the place a year or so afterwards, on his way to or from Oxford or Cambridge; and happy was the boy who remembered him, and sure of an audience as he expounded what he used to do and say, though it were sad enough stuff to make angels, not to say head-masters, weep.",require old popularity carry part speech relate be such bigoted holder establish form custom foolish meaningless english school boy least school boy generation magnify hero boy leave look awe reverence revisite place year way happy boy remember sure audience expound use do say sad enough stuff make angel say head master weep 
42,"We looked upon every trumpery little custom and habit which had obtained in the School as though it had been a law of the Medes and Persians, and regarded the infringement or variation of it as a sort of sacrilege. And the Doctor, than whom no man or boy had a stronger liking for old school customs which were good and sensible, had, as has already been hinted, come into most decided collision with several which were neither the one nor the other. And as old Brooke had said, when he came into collision with boys or customs, there was nothing for them but to give in or take themselves off; because what he said had to be done, and no mistake about it. And this was beginning to be pretty clearly understood. The boys felt that there was a strong man over them, who would have things his own way, and hadn’t yet learnt that he was a wise and loving man also. His personal character and influence had not had time to make itself felt, except by a very few of the bigger boys with whom he came more directly into contact; and he was looked upon with great fear and dislike by the great majority even of his own house. For he had found School and School-house in a state of monstrous license and misrule, and was still employed in the necessary but unpopular work of setting up order with a strong hand.",look trumpery little custom habit obtain school law regard infringement variation sort sacrilege man boy have strong like old school custom good sensible hint come decide collision several one other old say come collision boy custom be give take say have do mistake begin understand boy feel be strong man have thing own way learn wise loving man personal character influence have time make feel few big boy come contact look great fear dislike great majority own house find house state monstrous license misrule employ necessary unpopular work set order strong hand 
43,"However, as has been said, old Brooke triumphed, and the boys cheered him and then the Doctor. And then more songs came, and the healths of the other boys about to leave, who each made a speech, one flowery, another maudlin, a third prosy, and so on, which are not necessary to be here recorded.",say old triumph boy cheer more song come health other boy about leave make speech flowery maudlin third prosy necessary record 
44,"Half-past nine struck in the middle of the performance of “Auld Lang Syne,” a most obstreperous proceeding, during which there was an immense amount of standing with one foot on the table, knocking mugs together and shaking hands, without which accompaniments it seems impossible for the youths of Britain to take part in that famous old song. The under-porter of the School-house entered during the performance, bearing five or six long wooden candlesticks with lighted dips in them, which he proceeded to stick into their holes in such part of the great tables as he could get at; and then stood outside the ring till the end of the song, when he was hailed with shouts.",half past strike middle performance obstreperous proceeding be immense amount stand foot table knock mug shake hand accompaniment seem impossible youth take part famous old song under porter house enter performance bear long wooden candlestick light dip proceed stick hole such part great table get stand ring end song hail shout

46,"Shouts of “No, no!” and a violent effort to strike up “Billy Taylor” for the third time. Bill looked appealingly to old Brooke, who got up and stopped the noise. “Now then, lend a hand, you youngsters, and get the tables back; clear away the jugs and glasses. Bill’s right. Open the windows, Warner.” The boy addressed, who sat by the long ropes, proceeded to pull up the great windows, and let in a clear, fresh rush of night air, which made the candles flicker and gutter, and the fires roar. The circle broke up, each collaring his own jug, glass, and song-book; Bill pounced on the big table, and began to rattle it away to its place outside the buttery door. The lower-passage boys carried off their small tables, aided by their friends; while above all, standing on the great hall-table, a knot of untiring sons of harmony made night doleful by a prolonged performance of “God Save the King.” His Majesty King William the Fourth then reigned over us, a monarch deservedly popular amongst the boys addicted to melody, to whom he was chiefly known from the beginning of that excellent if slightly vulgar song in which they much delighted,--",shout violent effort strike third time look old get stop noise lend hand youngster get table clear jug glasses right open window boy address sit long rope proceed pull great window let clear fresh rush night air make candle flicker gutter fire roar circle break collare own jug glass song book pounce big table begin rattle place buttery door low passage boy carry small table aid friend stand great hall table knot untire son harmony make night doleful prolonged performance save reign monarch popular boy addicted melody know beginning excellent vulgar song delight

51,"Then the quarter to ten struck, and the prayer-bell rang. The sixth and fifth form boys ranged themselves in their school order along the wall, on either side of the great fires, the middle-fifth and upper-school boys round the long table in the middle of the hall, and the lower-school boys round the upper part of the second long table, which ran down the side of the hall farthest from the fires. Here Tom found himself at the bottom of all, in a state of mind and body not at all fit for prayers, as he thought; and so tried hard to make himself serious, but couldn’t, for the life of him, do anything but repeat in his head the choruses of some of the songs, and stare at all the boys opposite, wondering at the brilliancy of their waistcoats, and speculating what sort of fellows they were. The steps of the head-porter are heard on the stairs, and a light gleams at the door. “Hush!” from the fifth-form boys who stand there, and then in strides the Doctor, cap on head, book in one hand, and gathering up his gown in the other. He walks up the middle, and takes his post by Warner, who begins calling over the names. The Doctor takes no notice of anything, but quietly turns over his book and finds the place, and then stands, cap in hand and finger in book, looking straight before his nose. He knows better than any one when to look, and when to see nothing. To-night is singing night, and there’s been lots of noise and no harm done--nothing but beer drunk, and nobody the worse for it, though some of them do look hot and excited. So the Doctor sees nothing, but fascinates Tom in a horrible manner as he stands there, and reads out the psalm, in that deep, ringing, searching voice of his. Prayers are over, and Tom still stares open-mouthed after the Doctor’s retiring figure, when he feels a pull at his sleeve, and turning round, sees East.",quarter strike prayer bell ring sixth fifth form boy rang school order wall side great fire middle fifth upper school boy long table middle hall low school boy upper part second long table run side hall farthest fire find bottom state mind body fit prayer think try make serious life do repeat head choruse song stare boy opposite wonder brilliancy waistcoat speculate sort fellow step head porter hear stair light gleam door fifth form boy stand stride doctor cap head book hand gather gown other walk middle take post begin call name take notice turn book find place stand cap hand finger book look nose know good one look see night sing night be lot noise harm do beer drunk bad look hot excited see fascinate horrible manner stand read psalm deep ring search voice prayer stare open mouthed retire figure feel pull sleeve turn see 
52,"“I say, were you ever tossed in a blanket?”",say toss blanket 
53,"“No,” said Tom; “why?”",say 
54,"“‘Cause there’ll be tossing to-night, most likely, before the sixth come up to bed. So if you funk, you just come along and hide, or else they’ll catch you and toss you.”",toss night likely sixth come bed funk come hide catch toss 
55,“Were you ever tossed? Does it hurt?” inquired Tom.,toss hurt inquire

57,"They stopped at the fireplace in the top passage, where were a crowd of small boys whispering together, and evidently unwilling to go up into the bedrooms. In a minute, however, a study door opened, and a sixth-form boy came out, and off they all scuttled up the stairs, and then noiselessly dispersed to their different rooms. Tom’s heart beat rather quick as he and East reached their room, but he had made up his mind. “I shan’t hide, East,” said he.",stop fireplace top passage crowd small boy whisper unwilling go bedroom minute study door open sixth form boy come scuttle stair disperse different room heart beat reach room make mind hide say

59,"The room was a great big one, with a dozen beds in it, but not a boy that Tom could see except East and himself. East pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and then sat on the bottom of his bed whistling and pulling off his boots. Tom followed his example.",room great big one bed boy see pull coat waistcoat sit bottom bed whistle pull boot follow example 
60,"A noise and steps are heard in the passage, the door opens, and in rush four or five great fifth-form boys, headed by Flashman in his glory.",noise step hear passage door open rush great fifth form boy head glory

62,"“Gone to ground, eh?” roared Flashman. “Push ‘em out then, boys; look under the beds.” And he pulled up the little white curtain of the one nearest him. “Who-o-op!” he roared, pulling away at the leg of a small boy, who held on tight to the leg of the bed, and sang out lustily for mercy.",gone ground roar push boy look bed pull little white curtain one roar pull leg small boy hold tight leg bed sing mercy

67,"Flashman, with an oath and a kick, released his prey, who rushed headlong under his bed again, for fear they should change their minds, and crept along underneath the other beds, till he got under that of the sixth-form boy, which he knew they daren’t disturb.",oath kick release prey rush bed fear change mind creep other bed get sixth form boy know disturb 
68,"“There’s plenty of youngsters don’t care about it,” said Walker. “Here, here’s Scud East--you’ll be tossed, won’t you, young un?” Scud was East’s nickname, or Black, as we called it, gained by his fleetness of foot.",be plenty youngster care say toss young un nickname call gain fleetness foot

78,"Meantime the procession went down the passage to Number 7, the largest room, and the scene of the tossing, in the middle of which was a great open space. Here they joined other parties of the bigger boys, each with a captive or two, some willing to be tossed, some sullen, and some frightened to death. At Walker’s suggestion all who were afraid were let off, in honour of Pater Brooke’s speech.",procession go passage large room scene tossing middle great open space join other party big boy captive willing toss sullen frighten death suggestion afraid let honour speech 
79,"Then a dozen big boys seized hold of a blanket, dragged from one of the beds. “In with Scud; quick! there’s no time to lose.” East was chucked into the blanket. “Once, twice, thrice, and away!” Up he went like a shuttlecock, but not quite up to the ceiling.",big boy seize hold blanket drag bed quick be time lose chuck blanket go shuttlecock ceiling 
80,"“Now, boys, with a will,” cried Walker; “once, twice, thrice, and away!”  This time he went clean up, and kept himself from touching the ceiling with his hand, and so again a third time, when he was turned out, and up went another boy. And then came Tom’s turn. He lay quite still, by East’s advice, and didn’t dislike the “once, twice, thrice;” but the “away” wasn’t so pleasant. They were in good wind now, and sent him slap up to the ceiling first time, against which his knees came rather sharply. But the moment’s pause before descending was the rub--the feeling of utter helplessness and of leaving his whole inside behind him sticking to the ceiling. Tom was very near shouting to be set down when he found himself back in the blanket, but thought of East, and didn’t; and so took his three tosses without a kick or a cry, and was called a young trump for his pains.",boy will cry time go clean keep touch ceiling hand third time turn go boy come turn lay advice dislike pleasant good wind send slap ceiling first time knee come moment pause descend rub feeling utter helplessness leave whole inside stick ceiling shouting set find blanket think take toss kick cry call young trump pain 
81,"He and East, having earned it, stood now looking on. No catastrophe happened, as all the captives were cool hands, and didn’t struggle. This didn’t suit Flashman. What your real bully likes in tossing is when the boys kick and struggle, or hold on to one side of the blanket, and so get pitched bodily on to the floor; it’s no fun to him when no one is hurt or frightened.",earn stand look catastrophe happen captive cool hand struggle suit real bully like toss boy kick struggle hold side blanket pitch floor fun hurt frighten

83,"“What a cursed bully you are, Flashey!” rejoined the other. “Up with another one.”",curse bully rejoin other one 
84,"And so now two boys were tossed together, the peculiar hardship of which is, that it’s too much for human nature to lie still then and share troubles; and so the wretched pair of small boys struggle in the air which shall fall a-top in the descent, to the no small risk of both falling out of the blanket, and the huge delight of brutes like Flashman.",boy toss peculiar hardship much human nature lie share trouble wretched pair small boy struggle air fall top descent small risk fall blanket huge delight brute 
85,"But now there’s a cry that the praepostor of the room is coming; so the tossing stops, and all scatter to their different rooms; and Tom is left to turn in, with the first day’s experience of a public school to meditate upon.",be cry praepostor room come tossing stop scatter different room leave turn first day experience public school meditate
