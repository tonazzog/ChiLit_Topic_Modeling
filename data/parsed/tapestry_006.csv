13,"They sat perfectly still to listen, but for a minute or two the sound which had caught Hugh's attention was not repeated. Everything about them was silent, except that now and then a soft faint breeze seemed to flutter across the water, slightly rippling its surface as it passed. The strange, even light which had shone over all the scene ever since the children had stepped out at the hillside door had now grown paler: it was not now bright enough to distinguish more than can be seen by an autumn twilight. The air was fresh and clear, though not the least cold; the drooping forms of the low-hanging branches of the island trees gave the children a melancholy feeling when they glanced in that direction.",sit listen minute sound catch attention repeat silent soft faint breeze seem flutter water ripple surface pass strange even light shine scene child step hillside door grow paler bright distinguish more see autumn twilight air fresh clear least cold droop form low hanging branch island tree give child melancholy feeling glance direction

16,"""It"" was a low sort of ""call"" which seemed to run round the shores of the lake like a preliminary note, and then completely died away. Instantly began from all sides the most curious music that Hugh and Jeanne had ever heard. It was croaking, but croaking in unison and regular time, and harsh as it was, there was a very strange charm about it--quite impossible to describe. It sounded pathetic at times, and at times monotonous, and yet inspiriting, like the beating of a drum; and the children listened to it with actual enjoyment. It went on for a good while, and then stopped as suddenly as it had begun; and then again, after some minutes of perfect silence, it recommenced in a low and regular chant--if such a word can be used for croaking--a steady, regular croak, croak, as if an immense number of harsh-sounding instruments were giving forth one note in such precise tune and measure that the harshness was softened and lost by the union of sound. It grew lower and lower, seeming almost to be about to die altogether away, when, from another direction--from the tree-shaded island in the centre of the lake--rose, low and faint at first, gathering strange strength as it mounted ever higher and higher, the song of the swan.",low sort call seem run shore lake preliminary note die begin side curious music hear croak croak unison regular time harsh be strange charm impossible describe sound pathetic time time monotonous inspiriting beating drum child listen actual enjoyment go good while stop begin minute perfect silence recommence low regular chant word use croak steady regular croak croak immense number harsh sound instrument give note such precise tune measure harshness soften lose union sound grow low low seem about die direction tree shade island centre lake rose low faint first gather strange strength mount high high song swan 
17,"The children listened breathlessly and in perfect silence to the wonderful notes which fell on their ears--notes which no words of mine could describe, for in themselves they were words, telling of suffering and sorrow, of beautiful things and sad things, of strange fantastic dreams, of sunshine and flowers and summer days, of icy winds from the snow-clad hills, and days of dreariness and solitude. Each and all came in their turn; but, at the last, all melted, all grew rather, into one magnificent song of bliss and triumph, of joyful tenderness and brilliant hope, too pure and perfect to be imagined but in a dream. And as the last clear mellow notes fell on the children's ears, a sound of wings seemed to come with them, and gazing ever more intently towards the island they saw rising upwards the pure white snow-like bird--upwards and upwards, ever higher, till at last, with the sound of its own joyous song, it faded and melted into the opal radiance of the calm sky above.",child listen perfect silence wonderful note fall ear note word describe word tell suffering sorrow beautiful thing sad thing strange fantastic dream sunshine flower summer day icy wind snow clad hill day dreariness solitude come turn last melt grow magnificent song bliss triumph joyful tenderness brilliant hope pure perfect imagine dream last clear mellow note fall child ear sound wing seem come gaze island see rise upwards pure white snow bird upwards high last sound own joyous song fade melt opal radiance calm sky 
18,"For long the children gazed after it--a spot of light seemed to linger for some time in the sky just where it had disappeared--almost, to their fancy, as if the white swan was resting there, again to return to earth. But it was not so. Slowly, like the light of a dying star, the brightness faded; there was no longer a trace of the swan's radiant flight; again a soft low breeze, like a farewell sigh, fluttered across the lake, and the children withdrew their eyes from the sky and looked at each other.",child gaze spot light seem linger time sky disappear fancy white swan rest return earth light die star brightness fade be trace swan radiant flight soft low breeze farewell sigh flutter lake child withdraw eye sky look other

You might go to sleep too, if you like. I should think there will be time before we row back to the shore, only I do not know how we shall get the boat through the narrow part if the frogs have all gone.

31,"""We can whistle for Dudu again if we need,"" said Hugh. ""He helped us very well the last time. I too am rather sleepy, Jeanne, but still I think I had better not go _quite_ asleep.

32,"Jeanne seemed to fall asleep in a moment when she lay down. Hugh paddled on quietly, as he had said, thinking dreamily of the queer things they had seen and heard in this nameless country inside the tapestry door. He did not feel troubled as to how they were to get back again; he had great faith in Dudu, and felt sure it would all come right. But gradually he too began to feel very sleepy; the dip of the oars and the sound of little Jeanne's regular breathing seemed to keep time together in a curious way. And at last the oars slipped from Hugh's hold; he lay down beside Jeanne, letting the boat drift; he was so _very_ sleepy, he could keep up no more.",seem fall asleep moment lay paddle say think queer thing see hear nameless country tapestry door feel trouble get have great faith feel sure come begin feel sleepy dip oar sound little regular breathing seem keep time curious way last oar slip hold lay let boat drift sleepy keep more 
33,"But after a minute or two when, not _quite_ asleep, he lay listening to the soft breathing of the little girl, it seemed to him he heard still the gentle dip of the oars. The more he listened, the more sure he became that it was so, and at last his curiosity grew so great that it half overcame his drowsiness. He opened his eyes just enough to look up. Yes, he was right, the boat was gliding steadily along, the oars were doing their work, and who do you think were the rowers? Dudu on one side, Houpet on the other, rowing away as cleverly as if they had never done anything else in their lives, steadying themselves on one claw, rowing with the other. Hugh did not feel the least surprised; he smiled sleepily, and turned over quite satisfied.",minute asleep lay listen soft breathing little girl seem hear gentle dip oar listen sure become last curiosity grow great half overcame drowsiness open eye look right boat glide oar do work think rower side other row do else life steady claw row other feel least surprise smile turn satisfied

36,Hugh half sat up and rubbed his eyes.,half sit rub eye 
37,Where was he?,
38,"Not in the boat, there was no sound of oars, the light that met his gaze was not that of the strange country where Jeanne and he had had all these adventures, it was just clear ordinary moonlight; and as for where he was, he was lying on the floor of the tapestry room close to the part of the wall where stood, or hung, the castle with the long flight of steps, which Jeanne and he had so wished to enter. And from the other side of the tapestry--from inside the castle, one might almost say--came the voice he had heard in his sleep, the voice which seemed to have awakened him.",boat be sound oar light meet gaze strange country have adventure clear ordinary moonlight lie floor tapestry room part wall stand hang castle long flight step wish enter other side tapestry castle say come voice hear sleep voice seem awaken

40,"""Jeanne, Jeanne, where are you? Wait!"" cried Hugh, starting to his feet. But there was no reply.",wait cry start foot be reply 
41,"Hugh looked all round. The room seemed just the same as usual, and if he had looked out of the window, though this he did not know, he would have seen the old raven on the terrace marching about, and, in his usual philosophical way, failing the sunshine, enjoying the moonlight; while down in the chickens' house, in the corner of the yard, Houpet and his friends were calmly roosting; fat little Nibble soundly sleeping in his cage, cuddled up in the hay; poor, placid Grignan reposing in his usual corner under the laurel bush. All these things Hugh would have seen, and would no doubt have wondered much at them. But though neither tired nor cold, he was still sleepy, very sleepy, so, after another stare all round, he decided that he would defer further inquiry till the morning, and in the meantime follow the advice of Jeanne's farewell ""good-night.""",look room seem same usual look window know see old raven terrace march usual philosophical way fail sunshine enjoy moonlight chicken house corner yard friend roost fat little nibble sleep cage cuddle hay poor placid repose usual corner laurel bush thing see wonder tired cold sleepy sleepy stare decide defer further inquiry morning meantime follow advice farewell good night 
42,"And ""after all,"" he said to himself, as he climbed up into his comfortable bed, ""after all, bed is very nice, even though that little carriage was awfully jolly, and the boat almost better. What fun it will be to talk about it all to-morrow morning with Jeanne.""",say climb comfortable bed bed nice little carriage jolly boat good fun talk morning 
43,"It was rather queer when to-morrow morning came--when he woke to find it had come, at least; it was rather queer to see everything looking just the same as on other to-morrow mornings. Hugh had not time to think very much about it, for it had been Marcelline's knock at the door that had wakened him, and she told him it was rather later than usual. Hugh, however, was so eager to see Jeanne and talk over with her their wonderful adventures that he needed no hurrying. But, to his surprise, when he got to Jeanne's room, where as usual their ""little breakfast"" was prepared for them on the table by the fire, Jeanne was seated on her low chair, drinking her coffee in her every-day manner, not the least different from what she always was, not in any particular hurry to see him, nor, apparently, with anything particular to say.",queer morning come wake find come least queer see look same other morning have time think knock door waken tell late usual eager see talk wonderful adventure need hurrying surprise get room usual little breakfast prepare table fire seat low chair drink coffee day manner least different particular hurry see particular say

61,"""I think--I think,"" she said, and then she stopped. ""When you say that of the trees, I think I did see rainbow colours all turning into each other. I think, Chéri, part of me was there and part not; can there be two of me, I wonder? But please, Chéri, don't ask me any more. It puzzles me so, and then perhaps I may say something to vex you.

62,"So they kissed and made friends. But still it seemed very queer to Hugh. Till now Jeanne had always been eager to talk about the tapestry castle, and full of fancies about Dudu and Houpet and the rest of the animals, and anxious to hear Hugh's dreams. Now she seemed perfectly content with her every-day world, delighted with a new and beautiful china dinner-service which her godmother had sent her, and absorbed in cooking all manner of wonderful dishes for a grand dolls' feast, for which she was sending invitations to all her dolls, young and old, ugly and pretty, armless, footless, as were some, in the perfection of Parisian toilettes as were others. For she had, like most only daughters, an immense collection of dolls, though she was not as fond of them as many little girls.",kiss make friend seem queer eager talk tapestry castle full fancy rest animal anxious hear dream seem content day world delight new beautiful china dinner service godmother send absorb cook manner wonderful dish grand doll feast send invitation doll young old ugly pretty armless footless perfection parisian toilette other most only daughter immense collection doll fond many little girl 
63,"""I thought you didn't much care for dolls. It was one of the things I liked you for at the first,"" said Hugh, in a slightly aggrieved tone of voice. Lessons were over, and the children were busy at the important business of cooking the feast. Hugh didn't mind the cooking; he had even submitted to a paper cap which Jeanne had constructed for him on the model of that of the ""chef"" downstairs; he found great consolation in the beating up an egg which Marcelline had got for them as a great treat, and immense satisfaction in watching the stewing, in one of Jeanne's toy pans on the nursery fire, of a preparation of squashed prunes, powdered chocolate, and bread crumbs, which was to represent a ""ragout à la""--I really do not remember what.",think much care doll thing like first say aggrieved tone voice lesson child busy important business cook feast mind cooking submit paper cap construct model chef find great consolation beating egg get great treat immense satisfaction watch stewing toy pan nursery fire preparation squash prune powder chocolate bread crumb represent ragout remember

65,"""They wouldn't sit still one minute,"" said Jeanne. ""How funny you are to think of such a thing, Chéri! Of course it would be fun if they _would_, but fancy Dudu and Grignan helping themselves with knives and forks like people.""",sit minute say funny think thing course fun fancy help knife fork person 
66,"Jeanne burst out laughing at the idea, and laughed so heartily that Hugh could not help laughing too. But all the same he said to himself,",burst laugh idea laugh help laugh same say 
67,"""I'm sure Dudu and the others _could_ sit at the table and behave like ladies and gentlemen if they chose. How _very_ funny of Jeanne to forget about all the clever things they did!

68,"And as Hugh, for all his fancifulness, was a good deal of a philosopher, he made up his mind to amuse himself happily with little Jeanne as she was. The feast was a great success. The dolls behaved irreproachably, with which their owner was rather inclined to twit Hugh, when, just at the end of the banquet, greatly to his satisfaction, a certain Mademoiselle Zéphyrine, a blonde with flaxen ringlets and turquoise blue eyes, suddenly toppled over, something having no doubt upset her equilibrium, and fell flat on her nose on the table.",fancifulness good deal philosopher make mind amuse little feast great success doll behave owner inclined twit end banquet satisfaction certain blonde flaxen ringlet turquoise blue eye topple have doubt upset equilibrium fall flat nose table 
69,"""Ah!"" cried Jeanne, greatly concerned, ""my poor Zéphyrine has fainted,"" and, rushing forward to her assistance, worse results followed. Mesdames Lili and Joséphine, two middle-aged ladies somewhat the worse for wear, overcome by the distressing spectacle, _or_ by the sleeve of Jeanne's dress as she leant across them, fell off their chairs too--one, like Zéphyrine, on to the table, the other on to the floor, dragging down with her the plateful of ragout in front of her, while her friend's sudden descent upon the table completed the general knockings over and spillings which Zéphyrine had begun.",cry concerned poor faint rush assistance bad result follow middle aged lady bad wear overcome distressing spectacle sleeve dress lean fall chair table other floor drag plateful ragout front friend sudden descent table complete general knocking spilling begin 
70,"""Oh dear! oh dear!"" cried Jeanne; ""all the chocolate ragout is spilt, and the whipped-up egg is mixed with the orange-juice soup.

73,"""I don't think I _do_ care much for dolls,"" said Jeanne meditatively, when she had munched the last crumbs of the snipped-up almonds, which were supposed to represent some very marvellous dish. (""I like almonds terribly--don't you, Chéri?"") she added, as a parenthesis. ""No, I don't care for dolls. You are quite right about them; they _are_ stupid, and you can't make fancies about them, because their faces always have the same silly look. I don't know what I like playing at best.

85,"""Dear me,"" exclaimed Jeanne, ""how very queer! I had no idea of that. You haven't been there for a great many years any way, Marcelline.

105," Some days went on, and nothing more was said by the children about the adventures which had so puzzled poor Hugh. After a while he seemed to lose the wish to talk about them to little Jeanne; or rather, he began to feel as if he could not, that the words would not come, or that if they did, they would not tell what he wanted. He thought about the strange things he had seen very often, but it was as if he had read of them rather than as if he had seen and heard them, or as if they had happened to some one else. Whenever he saw Dudu and Houpet and the rest of the pets, he looked at them at first in a half dreamy way, wondering if they too were puzzled about it all, or if, being really fairies, they did not find anything to puzzle them! The only person (for, after all, he could often not prevent himself from looking upon all the animals as persons)--the only person who he somehow felt sure _did_ understand him, was Marcelline, and this was a great satisfaction. She said nothing; she almost never even smiled in what Jeanne called her ""funny"" way; but there was just a very tiny little undersound in the tone of her voice sometimes, a little wee smile in her eyes more than on her lips, that told Hugh that, fairy or no fairy, old Marcelline knew all about it, and it pleased him to think so.",day go more say child adventure puzzle poor while seem lose wish talk little begin feel word come tell want think strange thing see read see hear happen one else see rest pet look first half dreamy way wonder puzzled fairy find puzzle only person prevent look animal person only person feel sure _did_ understand great satisfaction say smile call funny way be tiny little undersound tone voice little wee smile eye lip tell fairy fairy old know pleased think

But you know what I like it for, Marcelline, and you said the other day that I hadn't half seen the tapestry castle, and I want very much to see it, Marcelline, only I'd like Jeanne to be with me; for I don't think I could tell her well about the fairy things if she hadn't been with me.

113,"""No,"" she said, ""you're right. The words wouldn't come, and if they did, it would be no use. You're older than Mademoiselle Jeanne, Monsieur Hugh, and it's different for her.

121,"Curiously enough Hugh had gone to sleep _that_ night without any thought of tapestry adventures. He and Jeanne had been very merry indeed; they had been dressing up, and playing delightful tricks--such as tapping at the salon door, and on being told to come in, making their appearance like two very, very old peasants, hobbling along on sticks--Jeanne with a cap and little knitted shawl of Marcelline's, Hugh with a blouse and cotton nightcap, so that Jeanne's mother quite jumped at first sight of the quaint little figures. Then Jeanne dressed up like a fairy, and pretended to turn Hugh into a guinea-pig, and they got Nibble up into the nursery, and Hugh hid in a cupboard, and tried to make his voice sound as if it came from Nibble, and the effect of his ventriloquism was so comical that the children laughed till they actually rolled on the floor. And they had hardly got over the laughing--though Marcelline did her best to make them sit still for half an hour or so before going to bed--when it was time to say good-night and compose themselves to sleep.",go sleep night thought tapestry adventure merry dress play delightful trick such tap salon door tell come make appearance old peasant hobble stick cap little knite shawl blouse cotton nightcap mother jump first sight quaint little figure dress fairy pretend turn guinea pig get nibble nursery hide cupboard try make voice sound come effect ventriloquism comical child laugh roll floor get laugh do good make sit hour go bed time say good night compose sleep

124,"And strange to say, hardly had she shut the door when Hugh did fall asleep--soundly asleep. He knew no more about who he was, or where he was, or anything--he just slept as soundly as a little top, without dreaming or starting in the least, for--dear me, I don't know for how long!--any way it must have been for several hours, when--in the strange sudden way in which once or twice before it had happened to him to awake in this curious tapestry room, he opened his eyes as if startled by an electric shock, and gazed out before him, as much awake as if he had never been asleep in his life.",strange say shut door fall asleep asleep know more sleep little top dreaming start least dear know way several hour strange sudden way happen awake curious tapestry room open eye startle electric shock gaze asleep life 
125,"What had awakened him, and what did he see? He could hardly have told what had awakened him but for what he _now_ saw and heard. A voice, a very well-known little voice, was speaking to him. ""Chéri dear,"" it said, ""Chéri, I have come for you. And see what I have got for you."" And there before him stood little Jeanne--but Jeanne as he had never seen her before. She seemed all glistening and shining--her dress was of some kind of sparkling white, and round her waist was a lovely silver girdle--her sleeves too were looped up with silver bands, and, prettiest of all, two snow-white wings were fastened to her shoulders. She looked like a fairy queen, or like a silvery bird turned into a little girl. And in her hand she held another pair of wings exactly like her own.",awaken see tell awaken see hear voice know little voice speak dear say come see get stand little see seem glisten shine dress kind sparkling white waist lovely silver girdle sleeve loop silver band prettiest snow white wing fasten shoulder look fairy queen silvery bird turn little girl hand hold pair wing own

129,"She gave her head a little toss, which made Hugh look at it. And now he noticed that on it she wore something very funny indeed, which at first, being black--for Jeanne's hair, you know, was black too--had not caught his attention. At first he thought it was some kind of black silk hood or cap, such as he had seen worn by some of the peasants in Switzerland, but looking again--no, it was nothing of the kind--the head-dress had a head of its own, and as Hugh stared, it cocked it pertly on one side in a way Hugh would have known again anywhere. Yes, it was Dudu, sitting on Jeanne's smooth little head as comfortably as if he had always been intended to serve the purpose of a bonnet.",give head little toss make look notice wear funny first black hair know black catch attention think kind black silk hood cap such wear peasant look kind head dress have head own stare cocked side way know sit smooth little head intend serve purpose bonnet

134,"The word made Hugh glance towards the window, for, for the first time he began to wonder how it was his room was so bright.

137,"She slipped them over his head--they seemed to be fastened to a band, and in a moment they had fitted themselves perfectly into their place. They were so light that Hugh was hardly conscious of them, and yet he could move them about--backwards and forwards, swiftly or slowly, just as he chose--and as easily as he could move his arms. Hugh was extremely pleased with them, but he looked at his little night-gown with sudden dismay.",slip head seem fasten band moment fit place light conscious move forward choose move arm pleased look little night gown sudden dismay

142,"Dudu nodded his wise head. Jeanne took Hugh's hand, and without Hugh's quite knowing how it was managed, they all flew up the wall together, and found themselves standing on the castle terrace.

145,"They were standing just in front of the door, by which, the last time, Hugh had entered the long lighted-up passage. As they stood waiting, the door slowly opened, but to Hugh's great surprise the inside was perfectly different. A very large white-painted hall was revealed to them. The ceiling was arched, and looking up, it seemed so very high, that it gave one more the feeling of being the sky than the roof of a house. This great hall was perfectly empty, but yet it did not feel chilly, and a faint pleasant perfume stole through it, as if not far off sweet-scented flowers and plants were growing.",stand front door last time enter long light passage stand wait door open great surprise inside different large white paint hall reveal ceiling arched look seem high give feeling sky roof house great hall empty feel chilly faint pleasant perfume steal sweet scented flower plant grow

I see no way out of this hall, and though it's rather nice, it's not very amusing.

159,"Off they set. The flying this time was really quite a pleasure in itself, and the higher up they rose the easier and swifter it seemed to become. The hall was lighted from the roof--at least the light seemed to come down from among the arches so high up that their form was only vaguely seen. But whether it was daylight or what, the children did not know, and perhaps it did not occur to them to think. They just flew softly on, till suddenly Dudu veered to one side and stopped them in front of a low carved door with a step before it just large enough for them to stand on. They had not noticed this door before--the hall was so very large and the door in comparison so small, and the step before it had looked just like a little jutting-out ledge in the carving, till they were close to it.",set fly time pleasure high rise easy swifter seem become hall light roof least light seem come arche high form see daylight child know occur think fly veer side stop front low carve door step large stand notice door hall large door comparison small step look little jutting out ledge carving close
