3,"A year had passed since the events narrated in the last chapter, and had brought with it many changes.",year pass event narrate last chapter bring many change 
4,"To Eric the changes were not for good. The memories of Russell were getting dim; the resolutions made during his illness had vanished; the bad habits laid aside after his death had been resumed. All this took place very gradually; there were many inward struggles, much occasional remorse, but the struggles by degrees grew weaker, and remorse lost its sting, and Eric Williams soon learned again to follow the multitude to do evil.",change good memory get dim resolution make illness vanish bad habit lay death resume take place be many inward struggle occasional remorse struggle degree grow weak remorse lose sting learn follow multitude do evil 
5,"He was now sixteen years old, and high in the fifth form, and, besides this, he was captain of the school eleven. In work he had fallen off and no one now expected the fulfilment of that promise of genius which he had given when he first came. But in all school sports he had improved, and was the acknowledged leader and champion in matters requiring boldness and courage. His popularity made him giddy; favor of man led him to forgetfulness of God; and even a glance at his countenance showed a self-sufficiency and arrogance which ill became the refinement of his features, and ill replaced the ingenuous modesty of former years.",year old high fifth form captain school work fall expect fulfilment promise genius give come school sport improve acknowledge leader champion matter require boldness courage popularity make giddy favor man lead forgetfulness glance countenance show self sufficiency arrogance ill become refinement feature ill replace ingenuous modesty former year 
6,"And Vernon Williams was no longer a new boy. The worst had happened to him, which Eric in his better moments could have feared. He had fallen into thoroughly bad hands, and Eric, who should have been his natural guardian and guide, began to treat him with indifference, and scarcely ever had any affectionate intercourse with him. It is by no means unfrequent that brothers at school see but little of each other, and follow their several pursuits, and choose their various companions, with small regard to the relationship between them.",new boy bad happen good moment fear fall bad hand natural guardian guide begin treat indifference have affectionate intercourse means unfrequent brother school see little other follow several pursuit choose various companion small regard relationship 
7,"Yet Eric could not overlook or be blind to the fact, that Vernon's chief friend or leader was the most undesirable whom he could have chosen. It was a new boy named Brigson. This boy had been expelled from one of the most ill-managed schools in Ireland, although, of course, the fact had been most treacherously concealed from the authorities at Roslyn; and now he was let loose, without warning or caution, among the Roslyn boys. Better for them if their gates had been open to the pestilence! the pestilence could but have killed the body, but this boy--this fore-front fighter in the devil's battle--did ruin many an immortal soul. He systematically, from the very first, called evil good and good evil, put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter. He openly threw aside the admission of any one moral obligation. Never did some of the Roslyn boys, to their dying day, forget the deep, intolerable, unfathomable flood of moral turpitude and iniquity which he bore with him; a flood, which seemed so irresistible, and the influence of such boys as Montagu and Owen to stay its onrush seemed as futile as the weight of a feather to bar the fury of a mountain stream. Eric might have done much, Duncan might have done much, to aid the better cause, had they tried; but they resisted at first but faintly, and then not at all, until they too were swept away in the broadening tide of degeneracy and sin.",overlook blind fact chief friend leader undesirable choose new boy name boy expel ill manage school course fact conceal authority let loose warning caution boy good gate open pestilence pestilence kill body boy fore front fighter battle ruin many immortal soul very first call evil good good evil put bitter sweet sweet bitter throw admission moral obligation do boy die day forget deep intolerable unfathomable flood moral turpitude iniquity bear flood seem irresistible influence such boy stay onrush seem futile weight feather bar fury mountain stream do much do much aid good cause try resist first sweep broaden tide degeneracy sin 
8,"Big, burly, and strong, though much younger than he looked (if he stated his age correctly, which I doubt), Brigson, being low in the school, naturally became the bully and the Coryphaeus of all the lower forms--the bully if they opposed him, the Coryphaeus if they accepted his guidance. A little army of small boys attended him, and were ever ready for the schemes of mischief to which he deliberately trained them, until they grew almost as turbulent, as disobedient, and as wicked, as himself. He taught, both, by precept and example, that towards masters neither honor was to be recognized, nor respect to be considered due. To cheat them, to lie to them, to annoy them in every possible way--to misrepresent their motives, mimic their defects, and calumniate their actions--was the conduct which he inaugurated towards them; and for the time that he continued at Roslyn the whole lower school was a Pandemonium of evil passions and despicable habits.",big burly strong young look state age doubt low school become bully low form bully oppose accept guidance little army small boy attend ready scheme mischief train grow turbulent disobedient wicked teach precept example master honor recognize respect consider due cheat lie annoy possible way misrepresent motive mimic defect calumniate action conduct inaugurate time continue whole low school pandemonium evil passion despicable habit 
9,"Every one of the little boys became more or less amenable to his influence, and among them. Vernon Williams. Had Eric done his duty this would never have been; but he was half-ashamed to be often with his brother, and disliked to find him so often creeping to his side. He flattered himself that in this feeling he was only anxious that Vernon should grow spirited and independent; but, had he examined himself, he would have found selfishness at the bottom of it. Once or twice his manner showed harshness to Vernon, and the little boy both observed and resented it. Montagu and others noticed him for Eric's sake; but, being in the same form with Brigson, Vernon was thrown much with him, and feeling, as he did, deserted and lonely, he was easily caught by the ascendancy of his physical strength and reckless daring. Before three months were over, he became, to Eric's intolerable disgust, a ringleader in the band of troublesome scapegraces, whose increasing numbers were the despair of all who had the interests of the school at heart.",little boy become amenable influence do duty half ashamed brother dislike find creep side flatter feeling anxious grow spirit independent examine find selfishness bottom manner show harshness little boy observe resent other notice sake same form throw much feel desert lonely catch ascendancy physical strength reckless dare month become intolerable disgust ringleader band troublesome scapegrace increase number despair have interest school heart 
10,"Unfortunately, Owen was now head of the school, and from his constitutional want of geniality, he was so little of a boy that he had no sympathy from the others, and little authority over them. He simply kept aloof, holding his own way, and retiring into his own tastes and pursuits, and the society of one or two congenial spirits in the school, so as in no way to come in contact with the spreading corruption.",head school constitutional want geniality little boy have sympathy other little authority keep aloof hold own way retire own taste pursuit society congenial spirit school way come contact spread corruption 
11,"Montagu, now Owen's chief friend, was also in the sixth, and fearlessly expressed at once his contempt for Brigson, and his dread of the evil he was effecting. Had the monitorial system existed, that contagion could have been checked at once; but, as it was, brute force the unlimited authority. Ill indeed are those informed who raise a cry, and join in the ignorant abuse of that noble safeguard of English schools. Any who have had personal and intimate experience of how schools work _with_ it and _without_ it, know what a Palladium it is of happiness and morality; how it prevents bullying, upholds manliness, is the bulwark of discipline, and makes boys more earnest and thoughtful, often at the most critical period of their lives, by enlisting all their sympathies and interests on the side of the honorable and the just.",chief friend sixth express contempt dread evil effect monitorial system exist contagion check brute force unlimited authority inform raise cry join ignorant abuse noble safeguard english school have personal intimate experience school work _without know happiness morality prevent bullying uphold manliness bulwark discipline make boy earnest thoughtful critical period life enlist sympathy interest side honorable 
12,"Brigson knew at a glance whom he had most to fear; Bull, Attlay, Llewellyn, Graham, all tolerated or even approved of him. Owen did not come in his way, so he left him unmolested. To Eric and Duncan he was scrupulously civil, and by flattery and deference managed to keep apparently on excellent terms with them. Eric pretended to be ignorant of the harm he was bringing about, and in answer to the indignant and measureless invectives of Montagu and others, professed to see in Brigson a very good fellow; rather wild, perhaps, but still a very good fellow.",know glance have most fear tolerate approve come way leave unmolested civil flattery deference manage keep excellent term pretend ignorant harm bring answer indignant measureless invective other profess see good fellow wild good fellow 
13,"Brigson hated Montagu, because he read on his features the unvarying glance of withering contempt. He dared not come across him openly, since Montagu was so high in the school; and besides, though much the bigger of the two, Brigson was decidedly afraid of him. But he chose sly methods of perpetual annoyance. He nick-named him ""Rosebud;"" he talked _at_ him whenever he had an opportunity; he poisoned the minds of the gang of youngsters against him; he spread malicious reports about him; he diminished his popularity, and embittered his feelings, by every secret and underhand means which, lay in his power.",hate read feature unvarying glance wither contempt come high school big afraid choose sly method perpetual annoyance name talk have opportunity poison mind gang youngster spread malicious report diminish popularity embitter feeling secret underhand means lay power 
14,"One method of torment was most successful. As a study-boy, Montagu did not come to bed till an hour later than _the_ lower part of the school, and Brigson taught some of the little fellows to play all kinds of tricks to his bed and room, so that, when he came down, it was with the certainty of finding everything in confusion. Sometimes his bed would be turned right on end, and he would have to put it to the ground and remake it before he could lie down. Sometimes all the furniture in the room would be thrown about in different corners, with no trace of the offender. Sometimes he would find all sorts of things put inside the bed itself. The intolerable part of the vexation was, to be certain that this was done by Brigson's instigation, or by his own hand, without having the means of convicting or preventing him. Poor Monty grew very sad at heart, and this perpetual dastardly annoyance weighed the more heavily on his spirits, from its being of a kind which peculiarly grated on his refined taste, and his natural sense of what was gentlemanly and fair.",method torment successful study boy come bed hour low part school teach little fellow play kind trick bed room come certainty find confusion bed turn end have put ground remake lie furniture room throw different corner trace offender find sort thing put bed intolerable part vexation certain do instigation own hand have means convict prevent poor grow sad heart perpetual dastardly annoyance weigh spirit being kind grate refine taste natural sense gentlemanly fair 
15,"One night, coming down, as usual, in melancholy dread, he saw a light under the door of his room. It struck him that he was earlier than usual, and he walked up quickly and noiselessly. There they were at it! The instant he entered, there was a rush through the opposite door, and he felt convinced that one of the retreating figures was Brigson's. In a second he had sprung across, so as to prevent the rest from running, and with heaving breast and flaming eyes, glared at the intruders as they stood there, sheepish and afraid.",night come usual melancholy dread see light door room strike early usual walk instant enter be rush opposite door feel convince retreat figure second spring prevent rest run heave breast flaming eye glare intruder stand sheepish afraid 
16,"""What!"" he said angrily, ""so _you_ are the fellows who have had the cowardice to annoy me thus, night after night, for weeks; you miserable, degraded young animals!"" And he looked at the four or five who had not made their escape. ""What! and _you_ among them,"" he said with a start, as he caught the eye of Vernon Williams--""Oh, this is too bad."" His tone showed the deepest sorrow and vexation, and for a moment he said no more. Instantly Vernon was by him.",say fellow have cowardice annoy night night week miserable degrade young animal look make escape say start catch eye bad tone show deep sorrow vexation moment say more 
17,"""_Do_ forgive me, _do_ forgive me, Montagu,"" he said; ""I really didn't know it teased you so much.""",forgive forgive say know tease 
18,"But Montagu shook him off, and at once recovered himself. ""Wretched boys! let me see what you have been doing to-night. Oh, as usual,"" he said, glancing at the complete disorder which they had been effecting. ""Ha! but what is this? So Brigson has introduced another vile secret among you. Well, he shall rue it!"" and he pointed to some small, almost invisible flakes of a whitish substance scattered here and there over his pillow. It was a kind of powder, which if once it touched the skin, caused the most violent and painful irritation.",shake recover wretch boy let see do night usual say glance complete disorder effect introduce vile secret rue point small invisible flake whitish substance scatter pillow kind powder touch skin cause violent painful irritation 
19,"""By heavens, this is _too_ bad!"" he exclaimed, stamping his foot with anger. ""What have I ever done to you young blackguards, that you should treat me thus? Have I ever been a bully? Have I ever harmed one of you? And _you_, too, Vernon Williams!""",heaven bad exclaim stamp foot anger do young blackguard treat bully harm 
20,The little boy trembled and looked ashamed under his noble glance of sorrow and scorn.,little boy tremble look ashamed noble glance sorrow scorn 
21,"""Well, I _know_ who has put you up to this; but you shall not escape so. I shall thrash you every one.""",_know put escape thrash one 
22,"Very quietly he suited the action to the word, sparing none. They took it patiently enough, conscious of richly deserving it; and when it was over, Vernon said, ""Forgive me, Montagu. I am very sorry, and will never do so again."" Montagu, without deigning a reply, motioned them to go, and then sat down, full of grief, on his bed. But the outrage was not over for that night, and no sooner had he put out the light than he became painfully aware that several boys were stealing into the room, and the next moment he felt a bolster fall on his head. He was out of bed in an instant, and with a few fierce and indignant blows, had scattered the crowd of his cowardly assailants, and driven them away. A number of fellows had set on him in the dark--on _him_, of all others. Oh, what a change must have happened in the school that this should be possible! He felt that the contagion of Brigson's baseness had spread far indeed.",suit action word spare take conscious deserve say forgive sorry do deign reply motion go sit full grief bed outrage night put light become aware several boy steal room next moment feel bolster fall head bed instant few fierce indignant blow scatter crowd cowardly assailant drive number fellow set dark other change happen school possible feel contagion baseness spread 
23,"He fought like a lion, and several of the conspirators had reason to repent their miscalculation in assaulting so spirited an antagonist. But this did not content him; his blood was up, and he determined to attack the evil at its source. He strode through his discomfited enemies straight into Brigson's room, struck a match, and said, ""Brigson, get out of bed this instant.""",fight lion several conspirator have reason repent miscalculation assault spirit antagonist content blood determine attack evil source strode discomfited enemy room strike match say get bed instant 
24,"""Hullo!"" grunted Brigson, pretending to be only just awake.",grunt pretend awake 
25,"""None of that, you blackguard! Will you take a thrashing?""",blackguard take thrashing 
26,"""No!"" roared Brigson, ""I should think not.""",roar think 
27,"""Well, then, take _that_!"" he shouted, striking him in the face.",take shout strike face 
28,"The fight that followed was very short. In a single round Montagu had utterly thrashed, and stricken to the earth, and forced to beg for mercy, his cumbrous and brutal opponent. He seemed to tower above him with a magnificent superiority, and there was a self-controlled passion about him which gave tremendous energy to every blow. Brigson was utterly dashed, confounded, and cowed, and took without a word the parting kick of ineffable contempt which Montagu bestowed on him.",fight follow short single round thrash stricken earth force beg mercy cumbrous brutal opponent seem tower magnificent superiority be self control passion give tremendous energy blow dash confound cow take word part kick ineffable contempt bestow 
29,"""There,"" he said to the fellows, who had thronged in from all the dormitories at the first hint of a fight, ""I, a sixth-form fellow, have condescended to thrash that base coward there, whom all you miserable lower boys have been making an idol and hero of, and from whom you have been so readily learning every sort of blackguardly and debasing trick. But let me tell you and your hero, that if any of you dare to annoy or lift a finger at me again, you shall do it at your peril. I despise you all; there is hardly one gentlemanly or honorable fellow left among you since that fellow Brigson has come here; yes, I despise you, and you know that you deserve it."" And every one of them _did_ shrink before his just and fiery rebuke.",say fellow throng dormitory first hint fight sixth form fellow condescend thrash base coward miserable low boy make idol hero learn sort blackguardly debase trick let tell hero dare annoy lift finger do peril despise be gentlemanly honorable fellow leave fellow come despise know deserve _did_ shrink fiery rebuke 
30,"The scene was not over when the door suddenly opened, and Mr. Rose appeared. He stood amazed to see Montagu there in his night-shirt, the boys all round, and Brigson washing his nose, which was bleeding profusely, at his basin.",scene door open appear stand amaze see night shirt boy wash nose bleed basin 
31,"Montagu instantly stepped up to him. ""You can trust me, sir; may I ask you kindly to say nothing of this? I have been thrashing some one that deserved it, and teaching these fellows a lesson.""",step trust sir ask say thrash one deserve teach fellow lesson 
32,"Mr. Rose saw and allowed for his excited manner. ""I can trust you,"" he said, ""Montagu, and shall take no farther notice of this irregularity. And now get instantly to your beds.""",see allow excited manner trust say take far notice irregularity get bed 
33,"But Montagu, slipping on his clothes, went straight up to the studies, and called the upper boys together. He briefly told them what had occurred, and they rejoiced greatly, binding themselves for the future to check, if they could, by all fair means, Brigson's pernicious influence and abominable example.",slip clothes go study call upper boy tell occur rejoice bind future check fair means pernicious influence abominable example 
34,But it was too late now; the mischief was done.,late mischief do 
35,"""O Eric,"" said Montagu, ""why did you not make a stand against all this before? Your own brother was one of them.""",say make stand own brother 
36,"""Little wretch. I'll kick him well for it,"" said Eric.",little wretch kick say 
37,"""No, no!"" said Montagu, ""that'll do no good. Try rather to look after him a little more.""",say do good try look little more 
38,"""I hope _you_ will forgive him, and try and rescue him.""",hope forgive try rescue 
39,"""I will do what I can,"" said Montagu, coldly.",do say 
40,"Eric sighed, and they parted.",sigh part 
41,"Montagu had hoped that after this Eric would at least break off all open connection with Brigson; and, indeed, Eric had meant to do so. But that personage kept carefully out of his way until the first burst of indignation against him had subsided, and after a time began to address Eric as if nothing had happened. Meanwhile he had completely regained his ascendancy over the lower part of the school, which was not difficult, because they were wincing under Montagu's contempt, and mingled no little dislike with it; a dislike which all are too apt to feel towards those whose very presence and moral superiority are a tacit rebuke of their own failings. But while Montagu was hated, Eric was at the zenith of popular favor, a favor which Brigson ostentatiously encouraged. He was openly flattered and caressed, and if ever he got a large score at cricket, it was chalked triumphantly over the walls. All this he was weak enough to enjoy immensely, and it was one of the reasons why he did not wish to risk his popularity by breaking with Brigson. So, after a little constraint and coldness, he began to stand in much the same relation to him as before.",hope least break open connection mean do personage keep way first burst indignation subside time begin address happen regain ascendancy low part school difficult wince contempt mingle little dislike dislike apt feel very presence moral superiority tacit rebuke own failing hate zenith popular favor favor encourage flatter caress get large score cricket chalk wall weak enjoy reason wish risk popularity break little constraint coldness begin stand same relation 
42,"The best-disposed of the upper boys disliked all this very much, and the sixth and fifth forms began to be split up into two main parties--the one, headed by Eric, and, to a much less degree, by Duncan, who devoted themselves to the games and diversions of the school, and troubled themselves comparatively little about anything else; the other, headed by Montagu, who took the lead in intellectual pursuits, and endeavored, by every means in their power, to counteract the pernicious effects of the spreading immorality.",dispose upper boy dislike sixth fifth form begin split main party one head less degree devote game diversion school trouble little else other head take lead intellectual pursuit endeavor means power counteract pernicious effect spread immorality 
43,"And so at Roslyn, owing mainly to the wickedness of one depraved boy, and the weak fear of man which actuated others, all was disunion, misery, and deterioration. The community which had once been peaceful, happy, and united, was filled with violent jealousy and heart-burnings; every boy's hand seemed to be against his neighbor; lying, bad language, dishonesty, grew fearfully rife, and the few who, like Owen and Montagu, remained uncontaminated by the general mischief, walked alone and despondent amid their uncongenial and degraded schoolfellow.",ow wickedness depraved boy weak fear man actuate other disunion misery deterioration community peaceful happy unite fill violent jealousy heart burning boy hand seem neighbor lie bad language dishonesty grow rife few remain uncontaminated general mischief walk despondent uncongenial degrade schoolfellow
