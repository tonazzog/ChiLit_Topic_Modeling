1,CHAPTER XVI. A FIGHT OF HEROES.,fight 
2," The horse was a good and spirited one, and when he had once descended to the plains, Cuthbert rode gaily along, exulting in his freedom, and in once again possessing arms to defend himself should it be needed. His appearance was so exactly that of the horsemen who were continually passing and repassing that no observation whatever was attracted by it. Through villages, and even through camps, Cuthbert rode fearlessly, and arrived, without having once been accosted, near the main camp of the Saracens, which extended for miles parallel to the sea. But at a distance of some three leagues beyond, could be seen the white tents of the Christian host, and Cuthbert felt that the time of trial was now at hand.",horse good spirit one descend plain ride exult freedom possess arm defend need appearance horsemen pass repass observation attract village camp ride arrive accost main camp extend mile parallel sea distance league see white tent christian host feel time trial hand 
3,"He dismounted for an hour to allow his steed to rest itself, fed it with dates from his wallet, and gave it a drink of water at the stream. Then, when he felt that it had thoroughly recovered its strength and freshness, he re-mounted, and rode briskly on as before. He passed unchallenged, attracting no more notice than a person now-a-days would do in walking along a crowded street. Without hesitation he passed through the tents and started across the open country. Bands of horsemen were seen here and there, some going, and some coming from the direction of the Christian camp. As it was doubtless supposed that he was on his way to join some band that had gone on in advance, the passage of the solitary horseman excited no comment until he approached within about two miles of the Christian camp. There were now, so far as he could see, no enemies between him and the point he so longed to gain. But at this minute a group of Arab horsemen, gathered, apparently on the look-out against any movement of the Christians, shouted to him ""Halt!"" demanding whither he was going.",dismount hour allow steed rest feed date wallet give drink water stream feel recover strength freshness re-mount ride pass attract more notice person day do walk crowded street hesitation pass tent start open country band horsemen see go come direction christian camp suppose way join band go advance passage solitary horseman excite comment approach mile christian camp be see enemy point long gain minute group arab horsemen gather look movement shout halt demand go 
4,"Up to this point Cuthbert had ridden at a gentle canter; but at the challenge he put spurs into his steed and made across the plain at full speed. With a wild yell the Arabs started in pursuit. They lay at first some 200 yards on his right, and he had therefore a considerable start of them. His horse was fairly fresh, for the journey that he had made had only been about fifteen miles--an inconsiderable distance to an Arab steed. For half a mile he did not think that his pursuers gained much upon him, riding as they had done sideways. They had now gathered in his rear, and the nearest was some 150 yards behind him. A quarter of a mile farther he again looked round, and found that two of the Arabs, far better mounted than the others, had come within half the distance which separated them from him when he last glanced back. His horse was straining to the utmost, and he felt that it could do no more; he therefore prepared himself for a desperate fight should his pursuers overtake him. In another quarter of a mile they were but a short distance behind, and an arrow whizzing by Cuthbert's ear told him they had be-taken themselves to their bows.",point ride gentle canter challenge put spur steed make plain full speed wild yell start pursuit lay first yard right have considerable start horse fresh journey make mile inconsiderable distance arab steed mile think pursuer gain much ride do gather rear near yard quarter mile far look find mount other come distance separate glance horse strain utmost feel do prepare desperate fight pursuer overtake quarter mile short distance arrow whizz ear tell take bow 
5,"Half a mile ahead he saw riding towards him a group of Christian knights; but he felt that it was too late for him to hope to reach them, and that his only chance now was to boldly encounter his pursuers. The main body of the Arabs was fully 200 yards behind--a short distance when going at a gallop--which left him but little time to shake off the pursuit of the two immediately behind him.",mile see ride group christian knight feel late hope reach only chance encounter pursuer main body yard short distance go gallop leave little time shake pursuit 
6,"A sharp stinging pain in his leg told him that it was time to make his effort; and checking his horse, he wheeled suddenly round. The two Arabs with a yell rode at him with pointed lance. With his right hand Cuthbert grasped the short heavy mace which hung at his saddle-bow, and being well practised in the hurling of this weapon--which formed part of the education of a good knight--he cast it with all his force at the chest of the Arab approaching on that side. The point of the spear was within a few yards of his breast as he flung the mace; but his aim was true, for it smote the Saracen full on the chest, and hurled him from his horse as if struck with a thunderbolt. At the same instant Cuthbert threw himself flat on the neck of his steed and the lance of the Arab who came up on the other side passed harmlessly between his shoulders, tearing his clothes as it went. In an instant Cuthbert had wheeled his horse, and before the Arab could turn his steed Cuthbert, coming up from behind, had run him through the body.",sharp sting pain leg tell time make effort check horse wheel yell ride point lance right hand grasp short heavy mace hang saddle bow practise hurl weapon form part education good knight cast force chest arab approaching side point spear few yard breast flung mace aim true smeat full chest hurl horse strike thunderbolt same instant throw flat neck steed lance come other side pass shoulder tear clothes go instant wheel horse turn steed come run body 
7,"Short as the delay had been, the main body of the pursuers were scarcely fifty yards away; but Cuthbert now continued his flight towards the knights, who were galloping forward at full speed; and a moment afterwards glancing back, he saw that his pursuers had turned and were in full flight.",short delay main body pursuer yard continue flight knight gallop full speed moment glance see pursuer turn full flight 
8,"With a shout of joy he rode forward to the party who had viewed with astonishment this conflict between what appeared to be three of the infidels. Even louder than his first shout of exultation was the cry of joy which he raised at seeing among the party to whom he rode up, the Earl of Evesham, who reined in his horse in astonishment, and drew his sword as the supposed enemy galloped towards him.",shout joy ride party view astonishment conflict appear infidel louder first shout exultation cry joy raise see party ride rein horse astonishment draw sword suppose enemy gallop 
9,"""My lord, my lord!"" Cuthbert said. ""Thank heaven I am safe with you again.""",lord lord say thank heaven safe 
10,The earl lowered his sword in astonishment.,earl lower sword astonishment 
11,"""Am I mad,"" he said, ""or dreaming, or is this really Sir Cuthbert?""",mad say dreaming 
12,"""It is I sure enough,"" Cuthbert exclaimed, ""although truly I look more like a Bedouin soldier than a Christian knight.""",sure exclaim look bedouin soldier christian knight 
13,"""My dear boy!"" exclaimed the earl, galloping forward and throwing his arms around Cuthbert's neck, ""we thought you were dead. But by what wonderful fortune have you succeeded in escaping?""",dear boy exclaim earl gallop throw arm neck think dead wonderful fortune succeed escape 
14,"In a few words Cuthbert related the principal incidents of his adventures, and he was heartily congratulated by the assembled knights.",few word relate principal incident adventure congratulate assemble knight 
15,"There was, however, no time for long explanations. Large bodies of the Saracen horse were already sweeping down, to capture, if possible, this small band of knights who had ventured so far from the camp; and as King Richard's orders were that none should venture upon conflicts except by his orders, the party reluctantly turned their horses and galloped back to the camp.",be time long explanation large body horse sweep capture possible small band knight venture camp order venture conflict order party turn horse gallop camp 
16,"Great as had been the earl's joy, it was, if possible, exceeded by that of Cnut on discovering in the Arab chief who rode up alongside the earl, the lad he loved so well. Loud and hearty were the cheers which rang out from the earl's camp as the news spread, and Cuthbert was compelled to shake hands with the whole party before entering the earl's tent, to refresh himself and give the narrative of what had happened.",great earl joy possible exceed discover arab chief ride earl lad love loud hearty cheer ring earl camp news spread compel shake hand whole party enter earl tent refresh give narrative happen 
17,"Cuthbert, retiring to his tent with the Earl of Evesham, inquired of him what had taken place during his absence.",retire tent inquire take place absence 
18,"""For,"" he said, ""although but a short three days' march from here, I have been as one of the dead, and have heard nothing whatever of what has taken place.""",say short day march dead hear take place 
19,"""Nothing could have gone worse,"" the earl said. ""We have had nothing but dissensions and quarrels. First, the king fell out with the Archduke of Austria.""",go bad earl say have dissension quarrel king fall 
20,"""On what ground did this happen?"" Cuthbert asked.",ground happen ask 
21,"""For once,"" the earl said, ""the king our master was wholly in the wrong, which is not generally the case. We had just taken Ascalon, and were hard at work fortifying the place. King Richard with his usual zeal, in order to encourage the army, seized heavy stones and himself bore them into their place. The Archduke stood near with some of his knights: and it may be that the haughty Austrian looked somewhat superciliously at our king, thus labouring.",earl say king master wrong case take hard work fortify place usual zeal order encourage army seize heavy stone bear place stand knight haughty look king labour 
22,"""'Why do you not make a show of helping?' King Richard said, going up to him. 'It would encourage the men, and show that the labour upon which we are engaged can be undertaken by all without derogation.'",make show help say go encourage man show labour engage undertake derogation 
23,"""To this the Archduke replied,--",reply 
24,"""'I am not the son of a mason!'",son mason 
25,"""Whereupon Richard, whose blood no doubt had been excited by the air of the Austrian, struck him with his hand a fierce blow across the face. We nearly betook ourselves to our swords on both sides; but King Richard himself could have scattered half the Austrians, and these, knowing that against his impetuous valour they could do nothing, simply withdrew from our camp, and sailed the next day for home. Then the king, in order to conciliate some at least of his allies, conferred the crown of Jerusalem upon Conrad of Montferat. No sooner had he done this than Conrad was mysteriously wounded. By whom it was done none knew. Some say that it was by emissaries of the Old Man of the Mountain. Others affirm that it was the jealousy of some of the knights of the holy orders. But be that as it may, he died. Some of the French, ever jealous of the valour of our king, ascribed it to his orders. This monstrous accusation coming to the ears of King Richard, he had hot words with the Duke of Burgundy. In this I blame him not, for it is beyond all reason that a man like the king, whose faults, such as they are, arise from too much openness, and from the want of concealment of such dislikes as he may have, should resort to poison to free himself of a man whom he himself had but a day or two before appointed King of Jerusalem. However it be, the consequences were most unfortunate, for the result of the quarrel was that the Duke of Burgundy and his Frenchmen followed the example of the Austrians, and we were left alone. Before this we had marched upon Jerusalem. But the weather had been so bad, and our train was so insufficient to carry the engines of war, that we had been forced to fall back again. King Richard again advanced, and with much toil we went as far as the village of Bethany.""",blood doubt excite air strike hand fierce blow face betak sword side scatter know impetuous valour do withdraw camp sail next day home king order conciliate least ally confer crown do wound do know say emissary old other affirm jealousy knight holy order die jealous valour king ascribe order monstrous accusation come ear have hot word blame reason man king fault such arise much openness want concealment such dislike resort poison free man have day appoint consequence unfortunate result quarrel follow example leave alone march weather bad train insufficient carry engine war force fall advance much toil go village 
26,"""Why,"" Cuthbert exclaimed, ""I passed through that village, and it is but three miles from the holy city.""",exclaim pass village mile holy city 
27,"""That is so,"" the earl said; ""and many of us, ascending the hill in front, saw Jerusalem. But even then it was certain that we must again retrace our steps; and when we asked King Richard to come to the crest of the hill to see the holy city, he refused to do so, saying, 'No; those who are not worthy of conquering Jerusalem should not look at it!' This was but a short time since, and we are now retracing our steps to Acre, and are treating with Saladin for a peace.""",earl say many ascend hill front see certain retrace step ask come crest hill see holy city refuse do say worthy conquer look short time retrace step treat peace 
28,"""Then,"" Cuthbert said sadly, ""all our hopes and efforts are thrown away; all this blood has been shed for nothing; and after the three great powers of Europe have engaged themselves solemnly in the war, we are baffled, and have to fall back before the hordes of the infidels.""",say hope effort throw blood shed great power engage war baffle have fall horde infidel 
29,"""Partly before them,"" the earl said, ""partly as the result of our own jealousies and passions. Had King Richard been a lesser man than he is, we might have conquered Jerusalem. But he is so extraordinary a warrior that his glory throws all others into the shade. He is a good general, perhaps the best in Europe; and had he done nothing but lead, assuredly we should have carried out our purpose. See how ably he maneuvered the army at the fight of Azotus. Never was a more complete defeat than that which he inflicted there upon the Saracens; and although the fact that his generalship achieved this, might have caused some jealousy to the other commanders, this might have died away could he between the battles have been a general, and nothing more. But alas! he is in addition a knight-errant--and such a knight-errant as Europe has never seen before. Wherever there is danger, Richard will plunge into the midst. There are brave men in all the three armies; but the strongest and bravest are as children to King Richard. Alone he can dart into ranks of the infidels, and cut a lane for himself by the strength of his right arm. More than this, when danger has threatened he has snatched up his battle-axe and dashed into the fray without helm or cuirass, performing such prodigies of valour and strength that it has been to his prowess alone that victory was to be ascribed. Hence he is the idol of all the soldiers, whatever their nationality; for he is as ready to rush to the rescue of a French or Austrian knight when pressed as to that of his own men. But the devotion which the whole army felt for him was as gall and wormwood to the haughty Austrian and the indolent Frenchman; and the retirement of the King of France, which left Richard in supreme command, was in every way unfortunate.""",earl say result own jealousy passion less man conquer extraordinary warrior glory throw other shade good general good do lead carry purpose see maneuver army fight complete defeat inflict fact generalship achieve cause jealousy other commander die battle general more addition knight errant knight errant see be danger plunge midst be brave man army strong bravest child dart rank infidel cut lane strength right arm more danger threaten snatch battle axe dash fray helm cuirass perform such prodigy valour strength prowess victory ascribe idol soldier nationality ready rush rescue french austrian knight press own man devotion whole army feel gall wormwood haughty indolent retirement leave supreme command way unfortunate 
30,"Upon the following day the army again marched, and Cuthbert could not but notice the difference, not only in number but in demeanour, from the splendid array which had left Acre a few months before. There was little now of the glory of pennon and banner; the bright helms and cuirasses were rusted and dinted, and none seemed to care aught for bravery of show. The knights and men-at-arms were sunburnt and thin, and seemed but half the weight that they had been when they landed. Fatigue, hardship, and the heat had done their work; disease had swept off vast numbers. But the remains of the army were so formidable in their fighting powers that the Saracens, although following them at a distance in vast numbers, did not venture an attack upon them.",follow day army march notice difference number demeanour splendid array leave few month be little glory pennon banner bright helm cuirass rust dint seem care aught bravery show knight man arm sunburnt thin seem weight land fatigue hardship heat do work disease sweep vast number remains army formidable fighting power follow distance vast number venture attack 
31,"A few days after their arrival at Acre, the king gave orders for the embarcation of the troops. Just as they were preparing to enter the ships a small vessel was seen entering the harbour. It drew up to the shore, and a knight leaped from it, and, inquiring where King Richard was to be found, made his way to the king, who was standing superintending the embarcation of some of the horses.",few day arrival king give order embarcation troops prepare enter ship small vessel see enter harbour draw shore knight leap inquire find make way king stand superintend embarcation horse 
32,"""The Saracens, sire!"" he exclaimed. ""The Saracens are besieging Jaffa, and the place must be lost unless assistance arrives in a day or two.""",sire exclaim besieg place lose assistance arrive day 
33,"The king leaped on board the nearest ship, shouted to his leading officers to follow him, and gave orders to others to bring down the troops with all possible speed, to waste not a moment, and to see that all was done, and then, in five minutes after the receipt of the news he started for Jaffa. The Earl of Evesham and Cuthbert had been standing near the king when the order was given, and followed him at once on board the bark which he had chosen.",king leap board near ship shout lead officer follow give order other bring troops possible speed waste moment see do minute receipt news start stand king order give follow board bark choose 
34,"""Ah, my gallant young knight,"" the king exclaimed, ""I am right glad to see you with me. We shall have more fighting before we have done, and I know that that suits your mood as well as my own.""",gallant young knight king exclaim glad see have more fighting do know suit mood own 
35,"The king's vessel was far in advance of any of the others, when early the following morning it arrived at Jaffa.",king vessel advance other follow morning arrive

40,"As the vessel neared the shore a monk ran out into the water up to his shoulders, and said to the king that the citadel still held out, and that even now the Saracens might be driven back. Without delay the king leaped into the water, followed by the knights and men-at-arms, and entering the gate, threw himself upon the infidels within, who, busy plundering, had not noticed the arrival of the ship.",vessel near shore monk run water shoulder say king citadel hold drive delay king leap water follow knight man arm enter gate throw infidel busy plundering notice arrival ship 
41,"The war cry of ""St. George! St. George!"" which the king always shouted in battle, struck panic among the infidels; and although the king was followed but by five knights and a few men-at-arms, the Saracens, to the number of 3000, fled before him, and all who tarried were smitten down. The king followed them out upon the plain, driving them before him as a lion would drive a flock of sheep, and then returned triumphant into the city.",war cry king shout battle strike panic infidel king follow knight few man arm number flead tarry smite king follow plain drive lion drive flock sheep return triumphant city 
42,"The next day, some more ships having arrived, King Richard found that in all, including the garrison, he could muster 2000 combatants. The enemy renewed the attack in great numbers, and the assaults upon the walls were continuous and desperate. King Richard, who loved fighting in the plain rather than behind walls, was impatient at this, and at one time so fierce was the attack that he resolved to sally out. Only ten horses remained in the town, and King Richard, mounting one, called upon nine of the knights to mount and sally out with him. The little band of ten warriors charged down upon the host of the Saracens and swept them before them. It was a marvellous sight indeed to see so small a group of horsemen dashing through a crowd of Saracen warriors. These, although at first beaten back, yet rallied, and the ten knights had great difficulty in fighting their way back to the town. When near the walls the Christians again made a stand, and a few knights sallied out from the town on foot and joined them. Among these was Cuthbert, the Earl of Evesham having accompanied King Richard in his charge. In all, seventeen knights were now rallied round the king. So fierce was the charge of the Saracens that the king ordered those on horseback to dismount, and with their horses in the centre, the little body knelt with their lances opposed to the Saracens. Again and again the wild cavalry swept down upon this little force, but in vain did they attempt to break their ranks. The scene was indeed an extraordinary one. At last the king, seeing that the enemy were losing heart, again ordered the knights to mount, and these dashing among the enemy, completed their defeat.",next day more ship arrive find include garrison muster combatant enemy renew attack great number assault wall continuous desperate love fight plain wall impatient time fierce attack resolve sally horse remain town mount call knight mount sally little band warrior charge host sweep marvellous sight see small group horsemen dash crowd warrior first beat rally knight have great difficulty fight way town wall make stand few knight sall town foot join accompany charge knight rally king fierce charge king order horseback dismount horse centre little body knolt lance oppose wild cavalry sweep little force vain attempt break rank scene extraordinary one last king see enemy lose heart order knight mount dash enemy complete defeat 
43,"While this had been going on, news came to the king that the Saracens from another side had made their way into Jaffa, and were massacring the Christians. Without an instant's delay he flew to their succour, followed only by two knights and a few archers, the rest being so worn by their exertions as to be unable to move. The Mamelukes, the chosen guard of Saladin, had headed the attack; but even these were driven out from the town, and Richard dashed out from the city in their pursuit. One Saracen emir, distinguished for his stature and strength, ventured to match himself against the king, and rode boldly at him. But with one blow Richard severed his head, and his right shoulder and arm, from his body. Then having, by his single arm, put to rout the Saracens at this point, he dashed through them to the aid of the little band of knights who had remained on the defensive when he left them at the alarm of the city being entered. These were almost sinking with fatigue and wounds; but King Richard opened a way around them by slaying numbers of the enemy, and then charged again alone into the midst of the Mussulman host, and was lost to the sight of his companions. All thought that they would never see him again. But he soon reappeared, his horse covered with blood, but himself unwounded; and the attack of the enemy ceased.",go news come king side make way massacre instant delay fly succour follow knight few archer rest wear exertion unable move choose guard head attack drive town dash city pursuit emir distinguish stature strength venture match king ride blow sever head right shoulder arm body have single arm put rout point dash aid little band knight remain defensive leave alarm city enter sink fatigue wound open way slay number enemy charge midst host lose sight companion think see reappear horse cover blood unwounded attack enemy cease 
44,"From the hour of daybreak, it is said, Richard had not ceased for a moment to deal out his blows, and the skin of his hand adhered to the handle of his battle-axe. This narration would appear almost fabulous, were it not that it is attested in the chronicles of several eye-witnesses, and for centuries afterwards the Saracen women hushed their babes when fractious by threatening them with Malek-Rik, the name which they gave to King Richard.",hour daybreak say cease moment deal blow skin hand adhere handle battle axe narration appear fabulous attest chronicle several eye witness century woman hush babe fractious threaten name give 
45,"Glorious as was the success, it was a sad one, for several of the most devoted of the followers of King Richard were wounded badly, some few to death. Among these last, to the terrible grief of Cuthbert, was his friend and patron, the Earl of Evesham. The king, on taking off his armour, hurried to his tent.",glorious success sad one several devoted follower wound few death last terrible grief friend patron king take armour hurry tent

47,"""I fear that it must even be so, my lord,"" the dying earl said. ""I am glad that I have seen this day, for never did I think to witness such feats as those which your Majesty has performed; and though the crusade has failed, and the Holy City remains in the hands of the infidel, yet assuredly no shadow of disgrace has fallen upon the English arms, and, indeed, great glory has accrued to us. Whatever may be said of the Great Crusade, it will, at least, be allowed by all men, and for all time, that had the princes and soldiers of other nations done as your Majesty and your followers have done, the holy city would have fallen into our hands within a month of our putting foot upon the soil.

I have, as your Majesty knows, no male heirs, and my daughter is but young, and will now be a royal ward. I beseech your Majesty to bestow her in marriage, when the time comes, upon Sir Cuthbert. They have known each other as children, and the union will bring happiness, methinks, to both, as well as strength and protection to her; and further, if it might be, I would fain that you should bestow upon him my title and dignity.""",say point young knight kneel bedside son relationship blood slight affection close own majesty know male heir daughter young royal ward beseech bestow marriage time come know other child union bring happiness methink strength protection fain bestow title dignity

51,"Cuthbert was too overwhelmed with grief to feel a shadow of exaltation at the gracious intimation of the king; although, even then, a thought of future happiness in the care of the fair young lady Margaret passed before his mind.
