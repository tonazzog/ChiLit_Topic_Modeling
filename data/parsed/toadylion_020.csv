1,CHAPTER XX. THE SECRET PASSAGE.,secret 
2," For a full hour Hugh John sat on the top step of the stairs, or went back and forward between these and the narrow circular opening so high above his head, which was now filled with a sort of ruddy haze, the sign that the sun was setting comfortably and sedately outside, behind the smooth green hills in which the Cheviots broke down into the Solway Marshes. It was not so much that the boy dared not descend into the secret passage. Rather he did not wish to confront the blankness of disappointment. The steps might lead nowhere at all. They might drop off suddenly into the depths of a well.",full hour sit top step stair go narrow circular opening high head fill sort ruddy haze sign sun set smooth green hill break much boy descend secret passage wish confront blankness disappointment step lead drop depth 
3,"To prove to himself that he was quite calm, and also that he was in no hurry, Hugh John ate the third of his bread-squares and drank the water which had meantime collected in the stone shell. Heroes always refreshed themselves thus before an adventure.",prove calm hurry eat third bread square drink water meantime collect stone shell heroe refresh adventure 
4,"""'None knoweth when our lips shall touch the blessed bread again!' This prog's too hanged dry for anything!""--that was what Hugh John said, quoting (partly) from the ""Life and Death of Arthur the King.""",knoweth lip touch bless bread prog hang dry say quote 
5,"Then feeling that mere poetry was off and that the time for action had definitely come, he tied to his rope a large fallen stone which lay in a corner, and crawling over the shell to the head of the steps, he threw it down. It did not go far, appearing to catch in some projection. He tried again with a like result. He pulled it up. The stone was dry. The opening was not, then, a well with water at the bottom.",feel mere poetry time action come tie rope large fall stone lay corner crawl shell head step throw go appear catch projection try like result pull stone dry opening water bottom 
6,"So Hugh John cautiously put his foot upon the threshold of the secret passage, and commenced the perilous descent. He clutched the edge of the top step as he let himself down. It was cold, wet, and clammy, but the stones beneath seemed secure enough. So he continued to descend till he found himself in a narrow staircase which went down and down, gradually twisting to the left away from the light. His heart beat fast, and there was a curious heavy feeling about his nostrils, which doubtless came from the damp mists of a confined place so close to the river.",put foot threshold secret passage commence perilous descent clutch edge top step let cold wet clammy stone seem secure continue descend find narrow staircase go twist left light heart beat be curious heavy feeling nostril come damp mist confine place close river 
7,"The adventurous General had descended quite a long way when he came to a level stone-flagged passage. He advanced twenty yards along it, and then put out his hands. He found himself in a narrow cell, dripping with wet and ankle deep in mud. The cell was so small, that by making a couple of steps Hugh John could feel it from side to side. At the farther end of it there was evidently a door or passage of some sort, but it was blocked up with fallen stones and rubbish; yet through it came the strangest muffled noises. Something coughed like a man in pain. There was also a noise as of the feet of animals moving about stealthily and restlessly, and he seemed even to hear voices speaking.",adventurous descend long way come level stone flagge passage advance yard put hand find narrow cell drip wet ankle mud cell small make couple step feel side side far end be door passage sort block fall stone rubbish come strangest muffle noise cough man pain be noise foot animal move seem hear voice speak 
8,"A wild unreasoning fear suddenly filled the boy's heart. He turned and fled, stumbling hastily up the stairs by which he had so cautiously descended. The thought of the black beast, great as a calf, of which Nipper Donnan had spoken, came upon him and almost mastered him. Yet all the time he knew that Nipper had only said it to frighten him. But it was now dark night, even in the upper dungeon. He was alone in a haunted castle, and, as the gloaming settled down, Hugh John cordially agreed with Sir David Brewster, who is reputed to have said, ""I do not believe in ghosts, but I am afraid of them.""",wild unreasoning fear fill boy heart turn flead stumble stair descend thought black beast great calf speak come master time know say frighten dark night upper dungeon alone haunted castle gloaming settle agree reput say believe ghost afraid 
9,"In spite of all his gallantry of the day, and the resolutions he had made that his prison record should be strictly according to rule, Hugh John's sudden panic took complete hold of him. He sat down under the opening of the dungeon, and for the first time cried bitter tears, excusing himself on the ground that there was no one there to see him, and anyway he could easily leave that part out when he came to write his journal. About this time he also slipped in a surreptitious prayer. He thought that at least it could do no harm. Prissy had induced him to try this method sometimes, but mostly he was afraid to let her know about it afterwards, because it made Prissy so unbearably conceited. But after all this was in a dungeon, and many very respectable prisoners quite regularly said their prayers, as any one may see for themselves in the books.",spite gallantry day resolution make prison record accord rule sudden panic take complete hold sit opening dungeon first time cry bitter tear excuse ground be see leave part come write journal time slip surreptitious prayer think least do harm prissy induce try method afraid let know make prissy conceited dungeon many respectable prisoner say prayer one see book 
10,"""You see,"" said Hugh John, explanatorily afterwards, ""it's very easy for them. They have nothing else to do. They haven't to wash, and take baths, and comb their hair, and be ordered about! It's easy to be good when you're leading a natural life.""",see say easy have else do have wash take bath comb hair order easy good lead natural life 
11,"This was Hugh John's prayer, and a model for any soldier's pocket-book.",prayer model soldier pocket book 
12,"""Our Father Witch-Charta-Nevin"" (this he considered a Christian name and surname, curious but quite authoritative), ""help me to get out of this beastly hole. Help me to lick Nipper Donnan till he can't stand, and bust Sammy Carter for running away. For we are all miserable sinners. God bless father and Prissy, Arthur George (I wonder where the little beast went to--guess he sneaked--just wait!), Janet Sheepshanks, Mary Jane Housemaid, and everybody about the house and down at the stables, except Bella Murdoch, that is a clash-bag and a tell-tale-tit. And make me a good boy. For Jesus' sake. Aymen.""",consider christian name surname curious authoritative help get beastly hole help lick stand bust run miserable sinner bless father wonder little beast go guess sneak wait house stable clash bag tell tale tit make good boy sake aymen 
13,"That the last petition was by no means a superfluous one every reader of this history will agree. Hugh John very carefully said ""Ay-men"" now, because he had said ""A-men"" in the morning. He noticed that his father always said ""Ay-men"" very solemnly at the end of a prayer, while Prissy, who liked going to church even on week days (a low dodge!), insisted upon ""A-men."" So Hugh John used ""Ay-men"" and ""A-men"" time about, just to show that there was no ill-feeling. Thus early in life does the leaven of Gallio (who ""cared for none of these things"") begin to show itself. Hugh John was obviously going to be a very pronounced Broad Churchman.",last petition means superfluous one reader history agree say man say morning notice father say man end prayer like go church week day low dodge insist use ay man time show be ill feeling life leaven care thing begin show go pronounce 
14,"The prayer did the captive General much good. He was not now nearly so much afraid of the beasts. The hole did not seem to yawn so black beneath him; and though he kept his ear on the cock for anything that might come at him up the stairs, he could with some tolerable composure sit still and wait for the morning. He decided that so soon as it was even a little light, he would try again and find out if he could not remove the rubbish from the further door.",prayer do captive good afraid beast hole seem yawn black keep ear cock come stair tolerable composure sit wait morning decide little light try find remove rubbish further door 
15,"The midsummer morn was not long in coming--shorter far indeed to Hugh John than to the anxious hearts that were scattered broadcast over the face of the country seeking for him. Scarcely had the boy sat down to wait for the daylight when his head sank on his breast. Presently he swayed gently to the side, and turning over with a contented little murmur, he curled himself up like a tired puppy and went fast asleep. When he awoke, a fresher pink radiance than that of eventide filled the aperture above his head--the glow of the wide, sweet, blushful dawn which flooded all the eastern sky outside the tall grey walls of the Castle of Windy Standard.",midsummer morn long come anxious heart scatter broadcast face country seek have boy sit wait daylight head sink breast sway side turn content little murmur curl tired puppy go awoke fresher pink radiance fill aperture head glow wide sweet blushful dawn flood eastern sky tall grey wall windy 
16,"Hugh John rose, stretched himself, yawned, and looked about him in surprise. There was no Toady Lion in a little white ship on four iron legs, moored safe alongside him; no open door through into Prissy's room; no birch-tree outside the window, glimmering purest white and delicatest pink in the morning light--nothing, in short, that had greeted his waking eyes every morning of his life hitherto.",rise stretch yawn look surprise be little white ship iron leg moor safe open door room birch tree window glimmer purest white delicatest pink morning light short greet wake eye morning life 
17,"But there were compensations. He was a prisoner. He had endured a night in a dungeon. His hair would almost certainly have turned pure white, or at least streaky. What boy of his age had ever done these things since the little Dauphin, about whom he was so sorry, and over whose fate he had shed such bitter tears? Had Sammy Carter? Hugh John smiled a sarcastic and derisive smile. Sammy Carter indeed! He would just like to see Sammy Carter try it once! _He_ would have been dead by this time, if he had had to go through the tenth of what he (Hugh John) had undergone. Had Mike or Peter? They were big and strong. They smoked pipes. But they had never been tortured, never shut up in a dungeon with wild beasts in the next compartment, and no hasp on the door.",be compensation prisoner endure night dungeon hair turn pure white least streaky boy age do thing little sorry fate shed such bitter tear have smile sarcastic derisive smile like see try dead time have go tenth undergone have big strong smoke pipe torture shut dungeon wild beast next compartment hasp door 
18,"The staircase--the secret passage! Hugh John's heart fluttered wildly. He might even yet get back in time for breakfast. There would be porridge--and egg-and-bacon--oh! crikey, yes, and it was kidney morning. Hugh John's mouth watered. There was no need of the cool fluid in the shell of limestone now! Could there indeed be such dainties in the world? It did not seem possible. And yet that very morning--he meant the morning before--no, surely it must have been in some other life infinitely remote, he had grumbled because he had not had cream instead of milk to his porridge, and because the bacon was not previously crisp enough. He felt that if ever he were privileged to taste as good bacon again, he would become religious like Prissy--or take some such extreme measure as that.",staircase secret passage heart flutter get time breakfast be porridge egg bacon crikey kidney morning mouth water be need cool fluid shell limestone be such dainty world seem possible very morning mean morning other life remote grumble have cream milk porridge bacon crisp feel privileged taste good bacon become religious take such extreme measure 
19,"[""OVER THE CLOSELY PACKED WOOLLY BACKS HE SAW A STRETCH OF RIPPLED RIVER.""]",packed woolly bacos saw stretch rippled 
20,"Hugh John had no appetite for the ""poison squares"" now. He tried one, and it seemed to be composed in equal parts of sawdust and the medicament called ""Rough-on-rats!"" He tried the water in the shell, and that was somewhat better; but just to think of tea from the urn--soft ivory cream floating on the top, curded a little but light as blown sea-foam! Ah, he could wait no longer. The life of a prisoner was all very well, but he could not even get materials with which to write up his diary till he got home. For this purpose it was necessary that he should immediately make his escape. Also it was kidney morning, and if he did not hurry that little wretch Toady Lion would have eaten up every snatch. He resolved to lose no time.",have appetite poison square try seem compose equal part sawdust medicament call rough rat try water shell good think tea urn soft ivory cream float top curd little light blow sea foam wait life prisoner get material write diary get purpose necessary make escape kidney morning hurry little wretch eat snatch resolve lose time 
21,"So with eager steps he descended the steep wet stairs into the little stone chamber, which smelt fearfully damp and clammy, just as if all the snails in the world had been crawling there.",eager step descend steep wet stair little stone chamber smell damp clammy snail world crawl 
22,"""I bet the poor chap down here had toothache,"" said Hugh John, shivering as he went forward to attack the pile of fallen stones in front of the arched doorway. For an hour he worked most manfully, pulling out such as he could manage to loosen, and tossing others aside. Thus he gradually undercut the mass which blocked up the door, till, with a warning creak or two the whole pitched forward and inward, giving the daring pioneer just time to leap aside before it came toppling into the narrow cell, which it more than half filled. As soon as the avalanche had settled, Hugh John staggered over the top of the fallen stones and broken _débris_ to the small door. As his head came on a level with the opening he saw a strange sight. He looked into a little ruined turret, the floor of which was of smoothest green sward--or, rather, which would have been of green sward had it not been thickly covered with sheep, all lying placidly shoulder to shoulder, and composedly drawing in the morning air through their nostrils as if no such word as ""mutton"" existed in the vocabularies of any language.",bet poor chap have toothache say shiver go attack pile fall stone front arched doorway hour work pull such manage loosen toss other undercut mass block door warning creak whole pitch give dare pioneer time leap come topple narrow cell more half fill avalanche settle stagger top fall stone break _débris_ small door head come level opening see strange sight look little ruin turret floor smoothest green sward green sward cover sheep lie shoulder shoulder draw morning air nostril such word mutton exist vocabulary language 
23,"Beyond and over the closely packed woolly backs he saw a stretch of rippled river, faceted with diamond and ruby points, where the rising sun just touched the tips of the little chill wavelets which were fretted by the wind of morning, that gust of cooler air which the dawn pushes before it round the world. Hugh John was free!",pack woolly back see stretch ripple river facete diamond ruby point rise sun touch tip little chill wavelet fret wind morning gust cool air dawn push world free
