1,CHAPTER XXV. DIAMOND’S DREAM,diamond dream 
2," “THERE, baby!” said Diamond; “I’m so happy that I can only sing nonsense. Oh, father, think if you had been a poor man, and hadn’t had a cab and old Diamond! What should I have done?”",baby say happy sing nonsense father think poor man have cab old do 
3,"“I don’t know indeed what you could have done,” said his father from the bed.",know do say father bed 
4,"“We should have all starved, my precious Diamond,” said his mother, whose pride in her boy was even greater than her joy in the shillings. Both of them together made her heart ache, for pleasure can do that as well as pain.",starve precious say mother pride boy great joy shilling make heart ache pleasure do pain 
5,"“Oh no! we shouldn’t,” said Diamond. “I could have taken Nanny’s crossing till she came back; and then the money, instead of going for Old Sal’s gin, would have gone for father’s beef-tea. I wonder what Nanny will do when she gets well again. Somebody else will be sure to have taken the crossing by that time. I wonder if she will fight for it, and whether I shall have to help her. I won’t bother my head about that. Time enough yet! Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! I wonder whether Mr. Raymond would take me to see Nanny. Hey diddle! hey diddle! hey diddle diddle! The baby and fiddle! O, mother, I’m such a silly! But I can’t help it. I wish I could think of something else, but there’s nothing will come into my head but hey diddle diddle! the cat and the fiddle! I wonder what the angels do--when they’re extra happy, you know--when they’ve been driving cabs all day and taking home the money to their mothers. Do you think they ever sing nonsense, mother?”",say take crossing come money go old gin go father beef tea wonder do get else sure take crossing time wonder fight have help bother head time diddle wonder take see diddle baby fiddle mother silly help wish think else be come head diddle cat fiddle wonder angel do happy know drive cab day take home money mother think sing nonsense mother 
6,"“I daresay they’ve got their own sort of it,” answered his mother, “else they wouldn’t be like other people.” She was thinking more of her twenty-one shillings and sixpence, and of the nice dinner she would get for her sick husband next day, than of the angels and their nonsense, when she said it. But Diamond found her answer all right.",get own sort answer mother other person think more shilling sixpence nice dinner get sick husband next day angel nonsense say find answer right 
7,"“Yes, to be sure,” he replied. “They wouldn’t be like other people if they hadn’t their nonsense sometimes. But it must be very pretty nonsense, and not like that silly hey diddle diddle! the cat and the fiddle! I wish I could get it out of my head. I wonder what the angels’ nonsense is like. Nonsense is a very good thing, ain’t it, mother?--a little of it now and then; more of it for baby, and not so much for grown people like cabmen and their mothers? It’s like the pepper and salt that goes in the soup--that’s it--isn’t it, mother? There’s baby fast asleep! Oh, what a nonsense baby it is--to sleep so much! Shall I put him down, mother?”",sure reply other person nonsense nonsense silly diddle diddle cat fiddle wish get head wonder angel nonsense nonsense good thing mother little more baby much grow person cabmen mother pepper salt go soup mother be baby asleep nonsense baby sleep put mother 
8,"Diamond chattered away. What rose in his happy little heart ran out of his mouth, and did his father and mother good. When he went to bed, which he did early, being more tired, as you may suppose, than usual, he was still thinking what the nonsense could be like which the angels sang when they were too happy to sing sense. But before coming to any conclusion he fell fast asleep. And no wonder, for it must be acknowledged a difficult question.",chatter rise happy little heart run mouth do father mother good go bed do tired suppose usual think nonsense angel sing happy sing sense come conclusion fall asleep wonder acknowledge difficult question 
9,"That night he had a very curious dream which I think my readers would like to have told them. They would, at least, if they are as fond of nice dreams as I am, and don’t have enough of them of their own.",night have curious dream think reader like tell least fond nice dream have enough own 
10,"He dreamed that he was running about in the twilight in the old garden. He thought he was waiting for North Wind, but she did not come. So he would run down to the back gate, and see if she were there. He ran and ran. It was a good long garden out of his dream, but in his dream it had grown so long and spread out so wide that the gate he wanted was nowhere. He ran and ran, but instead of coming to the gate found himself in a beautiful country, not like any country he had ever been in before. There were no trees of any size; nothing bigger in fact than hawthorns, which were full of may-blossom. The place in which they grew was wild and dry, mostly covered with grass, but having patches of heath. It extended on every side as far as he could see. But although it was so wild, yet wherever in an ordinary heath you might have expected furze bushes, or holly, or broom, there grew roses--wild and rare--all kinds. On every side, far and near, roses were glowing. There too was the gum-cistus, whose flowers fall every night and come again the next morning, lilacs and syringas and laburnums, and many shrubs besides, of which he did not know the names; but the roses were everywhere. He wandered on and on, wondering when it would come to an end. It was of no use going back, for there was no house to be seen anywhere. But he was not frightened, for you know Diamond was used to things that were rather out of the way. He threw himself down under a rose-bush, and fell asleep.",dream run twilight old garden think wait come run back gate see run run good long garden dream dream grow spread wide gate want run run come gate find beautiful country country be tree size big fact hawthorn full may blossom place grow wild dry cover grass have patch heath extend side see wild ordinary heath expect furze bush holly broom grow rose wild rare kind side rose glow be gum cistus flower fall night come next morning lilac syringa laburnum many shrub know name rose wander wonder come end use go be house see frighten know use thing way throw rose bush fall asleep 
11,"He woke, not out of his dream, but into it, thinking he heard a child’s voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond!” He jumped up, but all was still about him. The rose-bushes were pouring out their odours in clouds. He could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose, issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness. But again came the voice calling him, and it seemed to come from over his head. He looked up, but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars--more brilliant, however, than he had seen them before; and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth.",wake dream think hear child voice call jump rose bush pour odour cloud see scent mist same colour rose issue slow fountain spread air join thin rosy vapour hang wilderness come voice call seem come head look see deep blue sky full star brilliant see sky star look earth 
12,"While he gazed up, again he heard the cry. At the same moment he saw one of the biggest stars over his head give a kind of twinkle and jump, as if it went out and came in again. He threw himself on his back, and fixed his eyes upon it. Nor had he gazed long before it went out, leaving something like a scar in the blue. But as he went on gazing he saw a face where the star had been--a merry face, with bright eyes. The eyes appeared not only to see Diamond, but to know that Diamond had caught sight of them, for the face withdrew the same moment. Again came the voice, calling “Diamond, Diamond;” and in jumped the star to its place.",gaze hear cry same moment see big star head give kind twinkle jump go come throw back fix eye gaze go leave scar blue go gaze see face star merry face bright eye eye appear see know catch sight face withdraw same moment come voice call jump star place 
13,"Diamond called as loud as he could, right up into the sky:",call loud sky 
14,"“Here’s Diamond, down below you. What do you want him to do?”",want do 
15,"The next instant many of the stars round about that one went out, and many voices shouted from the sky,--",next instant many star one go many voice shout sky 
16,“Come up; come up. We’re so jolly! Diamond! Diamond!”,come come jolly diamond diamond 
17,"This was followed by a peal of the merriest, kindliest laughter, and all the stars jumped into their places again.",follow peal merriest kindliest laughter star jump place 
18,“How am I to come up?” shouted Diamond.,come shout 
19,"“Go round the rose-bush. It’s got its foot in it,” said the first voice.",go rose bush get foot say first voice 
20,"Diamond got up at once, and walked to the other side of the rose-bush.",get walk other side rose bush 
21,"There he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted--a stair down into the earth. It was of turf and moss. It did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky, but Diamond had learned to look through the look of things. The voice must have meant that he was to go down this stair; and down this stair Diamond went, without waiting to think more about it.",find seem very opposite want stair earth turf moss seem promise get sky learn look look thing voice mean go stair stair go wait think more 
22,"It was such a nice stair, so cool and soft--all the sides as well as the steps grown with moss and grass and ferns! Down and down Diamond went--a long way, until at last he heard the gurgling and splashing of a little stream; nor had he gone much farther before he met it--yes, met it coming up the stairs to meet him, running up just as naturally as if it had been doing the other thing. Neither was Diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him: he never thought it was odd--and no more it was, there. It would have been odd here. It made a merry tune as it came, and its voice was like the laughter he had heard from the sky. This appeared promising; and he went on, down and down the stair, and up and up the stream, till at last he came where it hurried out from under a stone, and the stair stopped altogether. And as the stream bubbled up, the stone shook and swayed with its force; and Diamond thought he would try to lift it. Lightly it rose to his hand, forced up by the stream from below; and, by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake, threatened to come tumbling upon his head. But he avoided it, and when it fell, got upon it. He now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head, and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it, and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction, and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole. But scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him, and a number of naked little boys came running, every one eager to get to him first. At the shoulders of each fluttered two little wings, which were of no use for flying, as they were mere buds; only being made for it they could not help fluttering as if they were flying. Just as the foremost of the troop reached him, one or two of them fell, and the rest with shouts of laughter came tumbling over them till they heaped up a mound of struggling merriment. One after another they extricated themselves, and each as he got free threw his arms round Diamond and kissed him. Diamond’s heart was ready to melt within him from clear delight. When they had all embraced him,--",nice stair cool soft side step grow moss grass fern go long way last hear gurgling splashing little stream go meet meet come stair meet run do other thing least surprise see pitch step climb think odd more odd make merry tune come voice laughter hear sky appear promising go stair stream last come hurry stone stair stop stream bubble stone shake sway force think try lift rise hand force stream seem unaccountable perversion thing awake threaten come tumble head avoid fall get see opening water come pour head help stone scramble find side grassy hill round direction come brook vanish hole notice much merry shouting laughter burst number naked little boy come run one eager get shoulder flutter little wing use fly mere bud make help flutter fly foremost troop reach fall rest shout laughter come tumble heap mound struggle merriment extricate get free throw arm kiss heart ready melt clear delight embrace 
23,"“Now let us have some fun,” cried one, and with a shout they all scampered hither and thither, and played the wildest gambols on the grassy slopes. They kept constantly coming back to Diamond, however, as the centre of their enjoyment, rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate.",let have fun cry shout scamper play wild gambol grassy slope keep come centre enjoyment rejoice find lose playmate 
24,"There was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness. It blew into Diamond’s heart, and made him so happy that he was forced to sit down and cry.",be wind hillside blow very embodiment living gladness blow heart make happy force sit cry 
25,"“Now let’s go and dig for stars,” said one who seemed to be the captain of the troop.",let go dig star say seem captain troop 
26,"They all scurried away, but soon returned, one after another, each with a pickaxe on his shoulder and a spade in his hand. As soon as they were gathered, the captain led them in a straight line to another part of the hill. Diamond rose and followed.",scurry return pickaxe shoulder spade hand gather captain lead straight line part hill rise follow 
27,"“Here is where we begin our lesson for to-night,” he said. “Scatter and dig.”",begin lesson night say scatter dig 
28,"There was no more fun. Each went by himself, walking slowly with bent shoulders and his eyes fixed on the ground. Every now and then one would stop, kneel down, and look intently, feeling with his hands and parting the grass. One would get up and walk on again, another spring to his feet, catch eagerly at his pickaxe and strike it into the ground once and again, then throw it aside, snatch up his spade, and commence digging at the loosened earth. Now one would sorrowfully shovel the earth into the hole again, trample it down with his little bare white feet, and walk on. But another would give a joyful shout, and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head, or no bigger than his fist; when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into Diamond’s eyes that he was quite dazzled. Gold and blue were the commoner colours: the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple. And every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it, shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds.",be more fun go walk bent shoulder eye fix ground stop kneel look feel hand part grass get walk spring foot catch pickaxe strike ground throw snatch spade commence digg loosen earth shovel earth hole trample little bare white foot walk give joyful shout much tug loosening draw hole lump big head big fist side pour blaze golden bluish light eye dazzle gold blue commoner colour jubilation great red green purple time star dig little angel drop tool crowd shouting dance flutter wing bud 
29,"When they had examined it well, they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole; but they always stood back to give Diamond the first look. All that diamond could report, however, was, that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well, only somehow they were different--there was something marvellous about them--he could not tell what. Every time he rose from looking through a star-hole, he felt as if his heart would break for, joy; and he said that if he had not cried, he did not know what would have become of him.",examine kneel other peep hole stand give first look diamond report star hole see great many thing place person know different be marvellous tell time rise look star hole feel heart break joy say cry know become 
30,"As soon as all had looked, the star was carefully fitted in again, a little mould was strewn over it, and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered.",look star fit little mould strewn rest heap leave sign star discover 
31,"At length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour--a colour Diamond had never seen before. The moment the angel saw what it was, instead of showing it about, he handed it to one of his neighbours, and seated himself on the edge of the hole, saying:",length dig small star lovely colour colour see moment angel see show hand neighbour seat edge hole say 
32,“This will do for me. Good-bye. I’m off.”,do good bye 
33,"They crowded about him, hugging and kissing him; then stood back with a solemn stillness, their wings lying close to their shoulders. The little fellow looked round on them once with a smile, and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole. Diamond, as privileged, threw himself on the ground to peep after him, but he saw nothing. “It’s no use,” said the captain. “I never saw anything more of one that went that way.”",crowd hug kiss stand solemn stillness wing lie close shoulder little fellow look smile shoot star hole privileged throw ground peep see use say captain see more go way 
34,"“His wings can’t be much use,” said Diamond, concerned and fearful, yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest.",wing much use say concerned fearful comfort calm look rest 
35,"“That’s true,” said the captain. “He’s lost them by this time. They all do that go that way. You haven’t got any, you see.”",true say captain lose time do go way get see 
36,"“No,” said Diamond. “I never did have any.”",say have 
37,“Oh! didn’t you?” said the captain.,say captain 
38,"“Some people say,” he added, after a pause, “that they come again. I don’t know. I’ve never found the colour I care about myself. I suppose I shall some day.”",person say add pause come know find colour care suppose day 
39,"Then they looked again at the star, put it carefully into its hole, danced around it and over it--but solemnly, and called it by the name of the finder.",look star put hole dance call name finder 
40,“Will you know it again?” asked Diamond.,know ask 
41,"“Oh, yes. We never forget a star that’s been made a door of.”",forget star make door

43,"Diamond having neither pickaxe nor spade, had the more time to think.",have pickaxe spade have more time think 
44,"“I don’t see any little girls,” he said at last.",see little girl say last 
45,"The captain stopped his shovelling, leaned on his spade, rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand--the little angels were all left-handed--repeated the words “little girls,” and then, as if a thought had struck him, resumed his work, saying--",captain stop shovelling learn spade rub forehead left hand little angel leave handed repeat word little girl thought strike resume work say 
46,"“I think I know what you mean. I’ve never seen any of them, of course; but I suppose that’s the sort you mean. I’m told--but mind I don’t say it is so, for I don’t know--that when we fall asleep, a troop of angels very like ourselves, only quite different, goes round to all the stars we have discovered, and discovers them after us. I suppose with our shovelling and handling we spoil them a bit; and I daresay the clouds that come up from below make them smoky and dull sometimes. They say--mind, I say they say--these other angels take them out one by one, and pass each round as we do, and breathe over it, and rub it with their white hands, which are softer than ours, because they don’t do any pick-and-spade work, and smile at it, and put it in again: and that is what keeps them from growing dark.”",think know mean see course suppose sort mean tell mind say know fall asleep troop angel different go star discover discover suppose shovelling handling spoil bit daresay cloud come make smoky dull say mind say say other angel take pass round do breathe rub white hand softer do pick spade work smile put keep grow dark 
47,“How jolly!” thought Diamond. “I should like to see them at their work too.--When do you go to sleep?” he asked the captain.,jolly think like see work go sleep ask captain 
48,"“When we grow sleepy,” answered the captain. “They do say--but mind I say they say--that it is when those others--what do you call them? I don’t know if that is their name; I am only guessing that may be the sort you mean--when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep. They live on the west side of the hill. None of us have ever been to the top of it yet.”",grow sleepy answer captain say mind say say other call know name guess sort mean round come troop fall asleep live west side hill top 
49,"Even as he spoke, he dropped his spade. He tumbled down beside it, and lay fast asleep. One after the other each of the troop dropped his pickaxe or shovel from his listless hands, and lay fast asleep by his work.",speak drop spade tumble lay asleep other troop drop pickaxe shovel listless hand lay work 
50,"“Ah!” thought Diamond to himself, with delight, “now the girl-angels are coming, and I, not being an angel, shall not fall asleep like the rest, and I shall see the girl-angels.”",think delight girl angel come angel fall asleep rest see girl angel 
51,"But the same moment he felt himself growing sleepy. He struggled hard with the invading power. He put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open. But it was of no use. He thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill, and ceased to know.",same moment feel grow sleepy struggle invade power put finger eyelid pull open use think see glimmer pale rosy light green hill cease know 
52,"When he awoke, all the angels were starting up wide awake too. He expected to see them lift their tools, but no, the time for play had come. They looked happier than ever, and each began to sing where he stood. He had not heard them sing before.",awoke angel start expect see lift tool time play come look happy begin sing stand hear sing 
53,"“Now,” he thought, “I shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry. They don’t drive cabs, I see, but they dig for stars, and they work hard enough to be merry after it.”",think know kind nonsense angel sing merry drive cab see dig star work merry 
54,"And he did hear some of the angels’ nonsense; for if it was all sense to them, it had only just as much sense to Diamond as made good nonsense of it. He tried hard to set it down in his mind, listening as closely as he could, now to one, now to another, and now to all together. But while they were yet singing he began, to his dismay, to find that he was coming awake--faster and faster. And as he came awake, he found that, for all the goodness of his memory, verse after verse of the angels’ nonsense vanished from it. He always thought he could keep the last, but as the next began he lost the one before it, and at length awoke, struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all. He felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him. And yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even. It was something like this:",hear angel nonsense sense have much sense make good nonsense try set mind listen sing begin dismay find come fast fast come find goodness memory verse verse angel nonsense vanish think keep last next begin lose one length awoke struggle keep hold last verse feel effort keep forget verse vanish song kill time wide sure
