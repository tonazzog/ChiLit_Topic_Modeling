1,"CHAPTER XII. HOW BETSINDA FLED, AND WHAT BECAME OF HER",betsinda fled became 
2,"Betsinda wandered on and on, till she passed through the town gates, and so on the great Crim Tartary road, the very way on which Giglio too was going. ‘Ah!’ thought she, as the diligence passed her, of which the conductor was blowing a delightful tune on his horn, ‘how I should like to be on that coach!’ But the coach and the jingling horses were very soon gone. She little knew who was in it, though very likely she was thinking of him all the time.",wander pass town gate great road very way go think diligence pass conductor blow delightful tune horn like coach coach jingling horse gone know likely think time 
3,"Then came an empty cart, returning from market; and the driver being a kind man, and seeing such a very pretty girl trudging along the road with bare feet, most good-naturedly gave her a seat. He said he lived on the confines of the forest, where his old father was a woodman, and, if she liked, he would take her so far on her road. All roads were the same to little Betsinda, so she very thankfully took this one.",come empty cart return market driver kind man see pretty girl trudg road bare foot good give seat say live confines forest old father woodman like take road road same little take one 
4,"And the carter put a cloth round her bare feet, and gave her some bread and cold bacon, and was very kind to her. For all that she was very cold and melancholy. When after travelling on and on, evening came, and all the black pines were bending with snow, and there, at last, was the comfortable light beaming in the woodman’s windows; and so they arrived, and went into his cottage. He was an old man, and had a number of children, who were just at supper, with nice hot bread-and-milk, when their elder brother arrived with the cart. And they jumped and clapped their hands; for they were good children; and he had brought them toys from the town. And when they saw the pretty stranger, they ran to her, and brought her to the fire, and rubbed her poor little feet, and brought her bread and milk.",put cloth bare foot give bread cold bacon kind cold melancholy travel evening come black pine bending snow last comfortable light beam woodman window arrive go cottage old man have number child supper nice hot bread milk elder brother arrive cart jump clapp hand good child bring toy town see pretty stranger run bring fire rub poor little foot bring bread milk 
5,"‘Look, father!’ they said to the old woodman, ‘look at this poor girl, and see what pretty cold feet she has. They are as white as our milk! And look and see what an odd cloak she has, just like the bit of velvet that hangs up in our cupboard, and which you found that day the little cubs were killed by King Padella, in the forest! And look, why, bless us all! she has got round her neck just such another little shoe as that you brought home, and have shown us so often--a little blue velvet shoe!’",look father say old woodman look poor girl see cold foot have white milk look see odd cloak have bit velvet hang cupboard find day little cub kill forest look bless get neck little shoe bring show little blue velvet shoe 
6,"‘What,’ said the old woodman, ‘what is all this about a shoe and a cloak?’",say old woodman shoe cloak 
7,"And Betsinda explained that she had been left, when quite a little child, at the town with this cloak and this shoe. And the persons who had taken care of her had--had been angry with her, for no fault, she hoped, of her own. And they had sent her away with her old clothes--and here, in fact, she was. She remembered having been in a forest--and perhaps it was a dream--it was so very odd and strange--having lived in a cave with lions there; and, before that, having lived in a very, very fine house, as fine as the King’s, in the town.",explain leave little child town cloak shoe person take care angry fault hope own send old clothes fact remember forest dream odd strange live cave lion live fine house fine town 
8,"When the woodman heard this, he was so astonished, it was quite curious to see how astonished he was. He went to his cupboard, and took out of a stocking a five-shilling piece of King Cavolfiore, and vowed it was exactly like the young woman. And then he produced the shoe and piece of velvet which he had kept so long, and compared them with the things which Betsinda wore. In Betsinda’s little shoe was written, ‘Hopkins, maker to the Royal Family’; so in the other shoe was written, ‘Hopkins, maker to the Royal Family.’ In the inside of Betsinda’s piece of cloak was embroidered, ‘PRIN ROSAL’; in the other piece of cloak was embroidered ‘CESS BA. NO. 246.’ So that when put together you read, ‘PRINCESS ROSALBA. NO. 246.’",woodman hear astonished curious see astonished go cupboard take stock shilling piece vow young woman produce shoe piece velvet keep compare thing wear little shoe write maker royal other shoe write maker royal inside piece cloak embroider other piece cloak embroider no. put read no. 
9,"On seeing this, the dear old woodman fell down on his knee, saying, ‘O my Princess, O my gracious royal lady, O my rightful Queen of Crim Tartary,--I hail thee--I acknowledge thee--I do thee homage!’ And in token of his fealty, he rubbed his venerable nose three times on the ground, and put the Princess’s foot on his head.",see dear old woodman fall knee say gracious royal lady rightful hail acknowledge do homage token fealty rub venerable nose time ground put foot head 
10,"‘Why,’ said she, ‘my good woodman, you must be a nobleman of my royal father’s Court!’ For in her lowly retreat, and under the name of Betsinda, HER MAJESTY, ROSALBA, Queen of Crim Tartary, had read of the customs of all foreign courts and nations.",say good woodman nobleman royal father court lowly retreat name read custom foreign court nation 
11,"‘Marry, indeed, am I, my gracious liege--the poor Lord Spinachi once--the humble woodman these fifteen years syne. Ever since the tyrant Padella (may ruin overtake the treacherous knave!) dismissed me from my post of First Lord.’",marry gracious liege poor humble woodman year syne tyrant ruin overtake treacherous knave dismiss post first 
12,"‘First Lord of the Toothpick and Joint Keeper of the Snuffbox? I mind me! Thou heldest these posts under our royal Sire. They are restored to thee, Lord Spinachi! I make thee knight of the second class of our Order of the Pumpkin (the first class being reserved for crowned heads alone). Rise, Marquis of Spinachi!’ And with indescribable majesty, the Queen, who had no sword handy, waved the pewter spoon with which she had been taking her bread-and-milk, over the bald head of the old nobleman, whose tears absolutely made a puddle on the ground, and whose dear children went to bed that night Lords and Ladies Bartolomeo, Ubaldo, Catarina, and Ottavia degli Spinachi!",first joint mind heldest post royal restore make knight second class first class reserve crown head rise indescribable majesty have sword handy wave pewter spoon take bread milk bald head old nobleman tear make puddle ground dear child go bed night 
13,"The acquaintance HER MAJESTY showed with the history, and noble families of her empire, was wonderful. ‘The House of Broccoli should remain faithful to us,’ she said; ‘they were ever welcome at our Court. Have the Articiocchi, as was their wont, turned to the Rising Sun? The family of Sauerkraut must sure be with us--they were ever welcome in the halls of King Cavolfiore.’ And so she went on enumerating quite a list of the nobility and gentry of Crim Tartary, so admirably had Her Majesty profited by her studies while in exile.",acquaintance show history noble family empire wonderful remain faithful say welcome court wont turn family welcome hall go enumerate list nobility gentry have profit study exile 
14,"The old Marquis of Spinachi said he could answer for them all; that the whole country groaned under Padella’s tyranny, and longed to return to its rightful sovereign; and late as it was, he sent his children, who knew the forest well, to summon this nobleman and that; and when his eldest son, who had been rubbing the horse down and giving him his supper, came into the house for his own, the Marquis told him to put his boots on, and a saddle on the mare, and ride hither and thither to such and such people.",old say answer whole country groan tyranny long return rightful sovereign send child know forest summon nobleman old son rub horse give supper come house own tell put boot saddle mare ride such such person 
15," When the young man heard who his companion in the cart had been, he too knelt down and put her royal foot on his head; he too bedewed the ground with his tears; he was frantically in love with her, as everybody now was who saw her: so were the young Lords Bartolomeo and Ubaldo, who punched each other’s little heads out of jealousy; and so, when they came from east and west at the summons of the Marquis degli Spinachi, were the Crim Tartar Lords who still remained faithful to the House of Cavolfiore. They were such very old gentlemen for the most part that Her Majesty never suspected their absurd passion, and went among them quite unaware of the havoc her beauty was causing, until an old blind Lord who had joined her party told her what the truth was; after which, for fear of making the people too much in love with her, she always wore a veil. She went about privately, from one nobleman’s castle to another; and they visited among themselves again, and had meetings, and composed proclamations and counter-proclamations, and distributed all the best places of the kingdom amongst one another, and selected who of the opposition party should be executed when the Queen came to her own. And so in about a year they were ready to move.",young man hear companion cart knolt put royal foot head bedew ground tear love see young punch other little head jealousy come summons remain faithful such old gentleman most part suspect absurd passion go unaware havoc beauty cause old blind join party tell truth fear make person much love wear veil go nobleman castle visit have meeting compose proclamation counter proclamation distribute good place kingdom select opposition party execute come own year ready move 
16,"The party of Fidelity was in truth composed of very feeble old fogies for the most part; they went about the country waving their old swords and flags, and calling ‘God save the Queen!’ and King Padella happening to be absent upon an invasion, they had their own way for a little, and to be sure the people were very enthusiastic whenever they saw the Queen; otherwise the vulgar took matters very quietly, for they said, as far as they could recollect, they were pretty well as much taxed in Cavolfiore’s time, as now in Padella’s.",party truth compose feeble old fogie most part go country wave old sword flag call save happen absent invasion have own way little sure person enthusiastic see vulgar take matter say recollect tax time
