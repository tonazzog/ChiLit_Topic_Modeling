3,"     While I, thy dearest, sat apart,      And felt thy triumphs were as mine,      And lov’d them more than they were thine.                                             TENNYSON.",dearest sit feel triumph would more 
4," That was a week of weeks; the most memorable week in Ethel’s life, spent in indefatigable sight-seeing. College Chapels, Bodleian Library, Taylor Gallery, the Museum, all were thoroughly studied, and, if Flora had not dragged the party on, in mercy to poor George’s patience, Ethel would never have got through a day’s work.",week week memorable week life spend indefatigable sight see study drag party mercy poor patience get day work 
5,"Indeed, Mr. Ogilvie, when annoyed at being hurried in going over Merton Chapel with her, was heard to whisper that he acted the part of policeman, by a perpetual “move on”; and as Ethel recollected the portly form and wooden face of the superintendent at Stoneborough, she was afraid that the comparison would not soon be forgotten. Norman Ogilvie seemed to consider himself bound to their train as much as his namesake, or, as on the second morning, Norman reported his reasoning, it was that a man must walk about with somebody on Commemoration week, and that it was a comfort to do so with ladies who wore their bonnets upon their heads, instead of, like most of those he met, remind him of what Cock Robin said to Jenny Wren in that matrimonial quarrel, when",annoy hurry go hear whisper act part policeman perpetual move recollect portly form wooden face superintendent afraid comparison forget seem consider bind train much namesake second morning report reasoning man walk week comfort do lady wear bonnet head most meet remind say matrimonial quarrel 
6,"              Robin, he grew angry,              Hopped upon a twig--",grow angry hopp twig 
7," Flora was extremely delighted, and, in matronly fashion, told her sister that people were always respected and admired who had the strength of mind to resist unsuitable customs. Ethel laughed in answer, and said she thought it would take a great deal more strength of mind to go about with her whole visage exposed to the universal gaze; and, woman-like, they had a thorough gossip over the evils of the “backsliding”  head-gear.",delighted matronly fashion tell sister person respect admire have strength mind resist unsuitable custom laugh answer say think take great deal more strength mind go whole visage expose universal gaze woman have thorough gossip evil backsliding head gear 
8,"Norman had retreated from it into the window, when Flora returned to the charge about Harvey Anderson. She had been questioning their old friend Mr. Everard, and had learned from him that the cause of the hesitation with which his name had been received was that he had become imbued with some of the Rationalistic ideas current in some quarters. He seldom met Norman May without forcing on him debates, which were subjects of great interest to the hearers, as the two young men were considered as the most distinguished representatives of their respective causes, among their own immediate contemporaries. Norman’s powers of argument, his eloquence, readiness, and clearness, were thought to rank very high, and, in the opinion of Mr. Everard, had been of great effect in preventing other youths from being carried away by the specious brilliancy of his rival.",retreat window return charge question old friend learn cause hesitation name receive become imbue rationalistic idea current quarter meet force debate subject great interest hearer young man consider distinguished representative respective cause own immediate contemporary power argument eloquence readiness clearness think rank high opinion great effect prevent other youth carry specious brilliancy rival 
9,"Ethel valued this testimony far above the Newdigate prize, and she was extremely surprised by hearing Flora declare her intention of still asking Mr. Anderson to dinner, only consulting her brother as to the day.",value testimony prize surprised hear declare intention ask dinner consult brother day 
10,"“Why, Flora! ask him! Norman--”",ask 
11,"Norman had turned away with the simple answer, “any day.”",turn simple answer day 
12,"“Norman is wiser than you are, Ethel,” said Flora. “He knows that Stoneborough would be up in arms at any neglect from us to one of the Andersons, and, considering the rivalship, it is the more graceful, and becoming.”",wise say know arm neglect consider rivalship graceful become 
13,"“I do not think it right,” said Ethel stoutly; “I believe that a line ought to be drawn, and that we ought not to associate with people who openly tamper with their faith.”",think say believe line draw associate person tamper faith 
14,"“Never fear,” smiled Flora; “I promise you that there shall be no debates at my table.”",fear smile promise be debate table 
15,"Ethel felt the force of the pronoun, and, as Flora walked out of the room, she went up to Norman, who had been resting his brow against the window.",feel force pronoun walk room go rest brow window 
16,"“It is vain to argue with her,” she said; “but, Norman, do not you think it is clearly wrong to seek after men who desert and deny--”",vain argue say think wrong seek man desert deny 
17,"She stopped short, frightened at his pale look.",stop short frighten pale look 
18,"He spoke in a low clear tone that seemed to thrill her with a sort of alarm. “If the secrets of men’s hearts were probed, who could cast the first stone?”",speak low clear tone seem thrill sort alarm secret man heart probe cast first stone 
19,"“I don’t want to cast stones,” she began; but he made a gesture as if he would not hear, and, at the same moment, Mr. Ogilvie entered the room.",want cast stone begin make gesture hear same moment enter room 
20,"Had Ethel been at home, she would have pondered much over her brother’s meaning--here she had no leisure. Not only was she fully occupied with the new scenes around her, but her Scottish cousin took up every moment open to conversation. He was older than Norman, and had just taken his degree, and he talked with that superior aplomb, which a few years bestow at their time of life, without conceit, but more hopeful and ambitious, and with higher spirits than his cousin.",home ponder much brother meaning have leisure occupy new scene scottish cousin take moment open conversation old take degree talk superior aplomb few year bestow time life conceit hopeful ambitious high spirit cousin 
21,"Though industrious and distinguished, he had not avoided society or amusement, was a great cricketer and tennis-player, one of the “eight”  whose success in the boat races was one of Norman’s prime interests, and he told stories of frolics that reminded Ethel of her father’s old Cambridge adventures.",industrious distinguished avoid society amusement great cricketer tennis player success boat race prime interest tell story frolic remind father old adventure 
22,"He was a new variety in her eyes, and entertained her greatly. Where the bounds of banter ended, was not easy to define, but whenever he tried a little mystification, she either entered merrily into the humour, or threw it over with keen wit that he kept constantly on the stretch. They were always discovering odd, unexpected bits of knowledge in each other, and a great deal more accordance in views and opinions than appealed on the surface, for his enthusiasm usually veiled itself in persiflage on hers, though he was too good and serious to carry it too far.",new variety eye entertain bound banter end easy define try little mystification enter humour throw keen wit keep stretch discover odd unexpected bit knowledge other great deal more accordance view opinion appeal surface enthusiasm veil persiflage good serious carry 
23,"At Blenheim, perhaps he thought he had given an overdose of nonsense, and made her believe, as Meta really did, that the Duchess Sarah was his model woman; for as they walked in the park in search of Phoebe Mayflower’s well, he gathered a fern leaf, to show her the Glenbracken badge, and talked to her of his home, his mother, and his sister Marjorie, and the little church in the rocky glen. He gave the history of the stolen meetings of the little knot of churchmen during the days of persecution, and showed a heart descended straight from the Ogilvie who was “out with Montrose,” now that the upper structure of young England was for a little while put aside.",think give overdose nonsense make believe model woman walk park search gather fern leaf show badge talk home mother sister little church rocky glen give history stolen meeting little knot churchmen day persecution show heart descend upper structure young little while put 
24,"After this, she took his jokes much more coolly, and made thrusts beneath them, which he seemed to enjoy, and caused him to unfold himself the more. She liked him all the better for finding that he thought Norman had been a very good friend to him, and that he admired her brother heartily, watching tenderly over his tendencies to make himself unhappy. He confided to her that, much as he rejoiced in the defeats of Anderson, he feared that the reading and thought consequent on the discussions, had helped to overstrain Norman’s mind, and he was very anxious to carry him away from all study, and toil, and make his brains rest, and his eyes delight themselves upon Scottish mountains.",take joke make thrust seem enjoy cause unfold more like good find think good friend admire brother watch tendency make unhappy confide rejoice defeat fear reading thought consequent discussion help overstrain mind anxious carry study toil make brain rest eye delight scottish mountain 
25,"Thereupon came vivid descriptions of the scenery, especially his own glen with the ruined tower, and ardent wishes that his cousin Ethel could see them also, and know Marjorie. She could quite echo the wish, Edinburgh and Loch Katrine had been the visions of her life, and now that she had once taken the leap and left home, absence did not seem impossible, and, with a start of delight, she hailed her own conviction that he intended his mother to invite the party to Glenbracken.",come vivid description scenery own glen ruin tower ardent wish cousin see know echo wish vision life take leap leave absence seem impossible start delight hail own conviction intend mother invite party 
26,"After Norman’s visit, Mr. Ogilvie declared that he must come home with him and pay his long-promised visit to Stoneborough. He should have come long ago. He had been coming last winter, but the wedding had prevented him; he had always wished to know Dr. May, whom his father well remembered, and now nothing should keep him away!",visit declare come pay long promise visit come come last winter wedding prevent wish know father remember keep 
27,"Flora looked on amused and pleased at Ethel’s development--her abruptness softened into piquancy, and her countenance so embellished, that the irregularity only added to the expressiveness. There was no saying what Ethel would come to! She had not said that she would not go to the intended ball, and her grimaces at the mention of it were growing fainter every day.",look amused pleased development abruptness soften piquancy countenance embellish irregularity add expressiveness be say come say go intend ball grimace mention grow fainter day 
28,"The discussion about Harvey Anderson was never revived; Flora sent the invitation without another word--he came with half a dozen other gentlemen--Ethel made him a civil greeting, but her head was full of boats and the procession day, about which Mr. Ogilvie was telling her, and she thought of him no more.",discussion revive send invitation word come other gentleman make civil greeting head full boat procession day tell think 
29,"“A lucky step!” thought Flora. “A grand thing for Ethel--a capital connection for us all. Lady Glenbracken will not come too much into my sphere either. Yes, I am doing well by my sisters.”",lucky step think grand thing capital connection come sphere do sister 
30,"It would make stay-at-home people giddy to record how much pleasure, how much conversation and laughter were crowded into those ten days, and with much thought and feeling beside them, for these were not girls on whom grave Oxford could leave no impression but one of gaiety.",make stay home person giddy record much pleasure much conversation laughter crowd day much thought feeling girl grave leave impression gaiety 
31,"The whole party was very full of merriment. Norman May, especially, on whom Flora contrived to devolve that real leadership of conversation that should rightly have belonged to George Rivers, kept up the ball with wit and drollery far beyond what he usually put forth; enlivened George into being almost an agreeable man, and drew out little Meta’s vivacity into sunny sparkles.",whole party full merriment contrive devolve real leadership conversation belong keep ball wit drollery put enliven agreeable man draw little vivacity sunny sparkle 
32,"Meta generally had Norman for her share, and seemed highly contented with his lionisings, which were given much more quietly and copiously than those which his cousin bestowed upon his sister. Or if there were anything enterprising to be done, any tower to be mounted, or anything with the smallest spice of danger in it, Meta was charmed, and with her lightness and airiness of foot and figure, and perfectly feminine ways, showed a spirit of adventure that added to the general diversion. But if she were to be helped up or down anywhere, she certainly seemed to find greater security in Norman May’s assistance, though it was but a feather-like touch that she ever used to aid her bounding step.",have share seem contented lionising give cousin bestow sister be enterprising do tower mount small spice danger charm lightness airiness foot figure feminine way show spirit adventure add general diversion help seem find great security assistance feather like touch use aid bounding step 
33,"Both as being diffident, and, in a manner at home, Norman was not as constantly her cavalier as was Mr. Ogilvie to his sister; and, when supplanted, his wont was either to pioneer for Flora, or, if she did not need him, to walk alone, grave and abstracted. There was a weight on his brow, when nothing was going on to drive it away, and whether it were nervousness as to the performance in store for him, anxiety about Harry, or, as Mr. Ogilvie said, too severe application; some burden hung upon him, that was only lightened for the time by his participation in the enjoyment of the party.",diffident manner home cavalier sister supplant wont pioneer need walk alone grave abstract be weight brow go drive nervousness performance store anxiety say severe application burden hang lighten time participation enjoyment party 
34,"On Sunday evening, when they had been entering into the almost vision-like delight of the choicest of music, and other accompaniments of church service, they went to walk in Christchurch Meadows. They had begun altogether by comparing feelings--Ethel wondering whether Stoneborough Minster would ever be used as it might be, and whether, if so, they should be practically the better for it; and proceeding with metaphysics on her side, and satire on Norman Ogilvie’s, to speculate whether that which is, is best, and the rights and wrongs of striving for change and improvements, what should begin from above, and what from beneath--with illustrations often laughter-moving, though they were much in earnest, as the young heir of Glenbracken looked into his future life.",evening enter vision delight choicest music other accompaniment church service go walk begin compare feeling wonder use good proceed metaphysic side satire speculate good right wrong striving change improvement begin illustration laughter move earnest young heir look future life 
35,"Flora had diverged into wondering who would have the living after poor old Mr. Ramsden, and walked, keeping her husband amused with instances of his blunders.",diverge wonder have living poor old walk keep husband amuse instance blunder 
36,"Meta, as with Norman she parted from the rest, thought her own dear Abbotstoke church, and Mr Charles Wilmot, great subjects for content and thanksgiving, though it was a wonderful treat to see and hear such as she had enjoyed to-day; and she thought it was a joy, to carry away abidingly, to know that praise and worship, as near perfection as this earth could render them, were being offered up.",part rest think own dear church great subject content thanksgiving wonderful treat see hear such enjoy day think joy carry know praise worship perfection earth render offer 
37,"Norman understood her thought, but responded by more of a sigh than was quite comfortable.",understand thought respond more sigh comfortable 
38,"Meta went on with her own thoughts, on the connection between worship and good works, how the one leads to the other, and how praise with pure lips is, after all, the great purpose of existence.--Her last thought she spoke aloud.",go own thought connection worship good work one lead other praise pure lip great purpose existence last thought speak 
39,"“I suppose everything, our own happiness and all, are given to us to turn into praise,” she said.",suppose own happiness give turn praise say 
40,"“Yes--” echoed Norman; but as if his thoughts were not quite with hers, or rather in another part of the same subject; then recalling himself, “Happy such as can do so.”",echoe thought part same subject recall happy such do 
41,“If one only could--” said Meta.,say 
42,"“You can--don’t say otherwise,” exclaimed Norman; “I know, at least, that you and my father can.”",say exclaim know least father 
43,"“Dr. May does so, more than any one I know,” said Meta.",more one know say 
44,"“Yes,” said Norman again; “it is his secret of joy. To him, it is never, I am half sick of shadows.”",say secret joy sick shadow 
45,"“To him they are not shadows, but foretastes,” said Meta. Silence again; and when she spoke, she said, “I have always thought it must be such a happiness to have power of any kind that can be used in direct service, or actual doing good.”",shadow foretast say silence speak say think happiness have power kind use direct service actual do good 
46,"“No,” said Norman. “Whatever becomes a profession, becomes an unreality.”",say become profession become unreality 
47,"“Surely not, in becoming a duty,” said Meta.",become duty say 
48,"“Not for all,” he answered; “but where the fabric erected by ourselves, in the sight of the world, is but an outer case, a shell of mere words, blown up for the occasion, strung together as mere language; then, self-convicted, we shrink within the husk, and feel our own worthlessness and hypocrisy.”",answer fabric erect sight world outer case shell mere word blow occasion string mere language self convict shrink husk feel own worthlessness hypocrisy 
49,“As one feels in reproving the school children for behaving ill at church?” said Meta.,feel reprove school child behave ill church say 
50,"“You never felt anything approaching to it!” said Norman. “To know oneself to be such a deception, that everything else seems a delusion too!”",feel approach say know deception else seem delusion 
51,"“I don’t know whether that is metaphysical,” said Meta, “but I am sure I don’t understand it. One must know oneself to be worse than one knows any one else to be.”",know metaphysical say sure understand know bad know one else 
52,"“I could not wish you to understand,” said Norman; and yet he seemed impelled to go on; for, after a hesitating silence, he added, “When the wanderer in the desert fears that the spring is but a mirage; or when all that is held dear is made hazy or distorted by some enchanter, what do you think are the feelings, Meta?”",wish understand say seem impell go hesitate silence add wanderer desert fear spring mirage hold dear make hazy distort enchanter think feeling

54,"“What is the spell?” eagerly said Norman, standing still.",spell say stand 
55,"“Believe--” said Meta, hardly knowing how she came to choose the words.",believe say know come choose word 
56,"“I believe!” he repeated. “What--when we go beyond the province of reason--human, a thing of sense after all! How often have I so answered. But Meta, when a man has been drawn, in self-sufficient security, to look into a magic mirror, and cannot detach his eyes from the confused, misty scene--where all that had his allegiance appears shattered, overthrown, like a broken image, or at least unable to endure examination, then--”",believe repeat go province reason human thing sense answer man draw self sufficient security look magic mirror detach eye confused misty scene have allegiance appear shattered overthrown break image least unable endure examination 
57,"“Oh, Norman, is that the trial to any one here? I thought old Oxford was the great guardian nurse of truth! I am sure she cannot deal in magic mirrors or such frightful things. Do you know you are talking like a very horrible dream?”",trial one think old great guardian nurse truth sure deal magic mirror such frightful thing know talk horrible dream 
58,"“I believe I am in one,” said Norman.",believe say 
59,"“To be sure you are. Wake!” said Meta, looking up, smiling in his face. “You have read yourself into a maze, that’s all--what Mary calls, muzzling your head; you don’t really think all this, and when you get into the country, away from books, you will forget it. One look at our dear old purple Welsh hills will blow away all the mists!”",sure wake say look smile face read maze call muzzle head think get country book forget look dear old purple welsh hill blow mist 
60,"“I ought not to have spoken in this manner,” said Norman sadly. “Forget it, Meta.”",speak manner say forget 
61,"“Forget it! Of course I will. It is all nonsense, and meant to be forgotten,” said Meta, laughing. “You will own that it is by-and-by.”",forget course nonsense mean forget say laugh own 
62,He gave a deep sigh.,give deep sigh 
63,"“Don’t think I am unfeeling,” she said; “but I know it is all a fog up from books, books, books--I should like to drive it off with a good fresh gust of wind! Oh! I wish those yellow lilies would grow in our river!”",think unfeeling say know fog book book book like drive good fresh gust wind wish yellow lilie grow river 
64,"Meta talked away gaily for the rest of the walk. She was anything but unfeeling, but she had a confidence in Norman that forbade her to see anything here but one of his variations of spirits, which always sank in the hour of triumph. She put forth her brightness to enliven him, and, in their subsequent tete-a-tetes, she avoided all that could lead to a renewal of this conversation. Ethel would not have rested till it had been fought out. Meta thought it so imaginary, that it had better die for want of the aliment of words; certainly, hers could not reach an intellect like his, and she would only soothe and amuse him. Dr. May, mind-curer as well as body-curer, would soon be here, to put the climax to the general joy and watch his own son.",talk rest walk unfeeling have confidence forbid see variation spirit sink hour triumph put brightness enlive subsequent tete tete avoid lead renewal conversation rest fight think imaginary good die want aliment word reach intellect soothe amuse mind curer body curer put climax general joy watch own son 
65,"He did arrive; quite prepared to enjoy, giving an excellent account of both homes; Mr. Rivers very well, and the Wilmots taking care of him, and Margaret as comfortable as usual, Mary making a most important and capable little housekeeper, Miss Bracy as good as possible. He talked as if they had all nourished the better for Ethel’s absence, but he had evidently missed her greatly, as he showed, without knowing it, by his instant eagerness to have her to himself. Even Norman, prizeman as he was, was less wanted. There was proud affection, eager congratulation, for him, but it was Ethel to whom he wanted to tell everything that had passed during her absence--whom he treated as if they were meeting after a tedious separation.",arrive prepare enjoy give excellent account home take care comfortable usual make important capable little housekeeper good possible talk nourish good absence miss show know instant eagerness have prizeman want be proud affection eager congratulation want tell pass absence treat meet tedious separation 
66,"They dined rather early, and went out afterwards, to walk down the High Street to Christchurch Meadow. Norman and Ethel had been anxious for this; they thought it would give their father the best idea of the tout ensemble of Oxford, and were not without hopes of beating him by his own confession, in that standing fight between him and his sons, as to the beauties of Oxford and Cambridge--a fight in which, hitherto, they had been equally matched--neither partisan having seen the rival University.",dine go walk high anxious think give father good idea tout ensemble hope beat own confession standing fight son beauty fight match partisan see rival 
67,"Flora stayed at home; she owned herself fairly tired by her arduous duties of following the two young ladies about, and was very glad to give her father the keeping of them. Dr. May held out his arm to Ethel--Norman secured his peculiar property. Ethel could have preferred that it should be otherwise--Norman would have no companion but George Rivers; how bored he would be!",stay home own tired arduous duty follow young lady glad give father keeping hold arm secure peculiar property prefer have companion bored 
68,"All through the streets, while she was telling her father the names of the buildings, she was not giving her whole attention; she was trying to guess, from the sounds behind, whether Mr. Ogilvie were accompanying them. They entered the meadows--Norman turned round, with a laugh, to defy the doctor to talk of the Cam, on the banks of the Isis. The party stood still--the other two gentlemen came up. They amalgamated again--all the Oxonians conspiring to say spiteful things of the Cam, and Dr. May making a spirited defence, in which Ethel found herself impelled to join.",street tell father name building give whole attention try guess sound accompany enter meadow turn laugh defy doctor talk bank party stand other gentleman come amalgamate conspire say spiteful thing make spirit defence find impell join 
69,"In the wide gravelled path, they proceeded in threes; George attached himself to his sister and Norman. Mr. Ogilvie came to Ethel’s other side, and began to point out all the various notabilities. Ethel was happy again; her father was so much pleased and amused, with him, and he with her father, that it was a treat to look on.",wide gravell path proceed three attach sister come other side begin point various notability happy father pleased amused father treat look 
70,"Presently Dr. May, as usual, always meeting with acquaintances, fell in with a county neighbour, and Ethel had another pleasant aside, until her father claimed her, and Mr. Ogilvie was absorbed among another party, and lost to her sight.",usual meet acquaintance fall county neighbour have pleasant father claim absorb party lose sight 
71,"He came to tea, but, by that time, Dr. May had established himself in the chair which had hitherto been appropriated to her cousin, a chair that cut her nook off from the rest of the world, and made her the exclusive possession of the occupant. There was a most interesting history for her to hear, of a meeting with the Town Council, which she had left pending, when Dr. May had been battling to save the next presentation of the living from being sold.",come tea time establish chair appropriate cousin chair cut nook rest world make exclusive possession occupant be interesting history hear meeting leave pend battle save next presentation living sell 
72,"Few subjects could affect Ethel more nearly, yet she caught herself missing the thread of his discourse, in trying to hear what Mr. Ogilvie was saying to Flora about a visit to Glenbracken.",few subject affect catch miss thread discourse try hear say visit 
73,"The time came for the two Balliol men to take their leave. Norman May had been sitting very silent all the evening, and Meta, who was near him, respected his mood. When he said good-night, he drew Ethel outside the door. “Ethel,” he said, “only one thing: do ask my father not to put on his spectacles to-morrow.”",time come man take leave sit silent evening respect mood say good night draw door say thing ask father put spectacle

79,"“Well, good-night,” said Norman, sighing. “It will be over to-morrow; only remember the spectacles.”",good night say sigh remember spectacle 
80,"Dr. May laughed a good deal at the request, and asked if the rest of the party were to be blindfolded. Meta wondered that Ethel should have mentioned the request so publicly; she was a good deal touched by it, and she thought Dr. May ought to be so.",laugh good deal request ask rest party blindfold wonder mention request good deal touch think 
81,"Good-night was said, and Dr. May put his arm round Ethel, and gave her the kiss that she had missed for seven nights. It was very homelike, and it brought a sudden flash of thought across Ethel! What had she been doing? She had been impatient of her father’s monopoly of her!",good night say put arm give kiss miss night homelike bring sudden flash thought do impatient father monopoly 
82,"She parted with Flora, and entered the room she shared with Meta, where Bellairs waited to attend her little mistress. Few words passed between the two girls, and those chiefly on the morrow’s dress. Meta had some fixed ideas--she should wear pink. Norman had said he liked her pink bonnet, and then she could put down her white veil, so that he could be certain that she was not looking; Ethel vaguely believed Flora meant to wear--something--",part enter room share wait attend little mistress few word pass girl morrow dress have fix idea wear pink say like pink bonnet put white veil certain look believe mean wear 
83,"Bellairs went away, and Meta gave expression to her eager hope that Norman would go through it well. If he would only read it as he did last Easter to her and Ethel.",go give expression eager hope go read do last

85,“Oh! but think of all the eyes looking at him!”,think eye look 
86,"“Our’s are all that he really cares for, and he will think of none of them, when he begins. No, Meta, you must not encourage him in it. Papa says, if he did not think it half morbid--the result of the shock to his nerves--he should be angry with it as a sort of conceit!”",care think begin encourage say think half morbid result shock nerve angry sort conceit 
87,"“I should have thought that the last thing to be said of Norman!” said Meta, with a little suppressed indignation.",think last thing say say little suppress indignation

89,"“Then it is as they say, conquered faults grow to be the opposite virtues!” said Meta. “How very good he is, Ethel; one sees it more when he is with other people, and one hears all these young men’s stories!”",say conquer fault grow opposite virtue say good see other person hear young man story 
90,"“Everything Norman does not do, is not therefore wrong,” said Ethel, with her usual lucidity of expression.",do wrong say usual lucidity expression

92,"“Norman does not call them so, I am sure.”",call sure 
93,"“No, he is too good to condemn--”",good condemn 
94,"“It is not only that,” said Ethel. “I know papa thinks that the first grief, coming at his age, and in the manner it did, checked and subdued his spirits, so that he has little pleasure in those things. And he always meant to be a clergyman, which acted as a sort of consecration on him; but many things are innocent; and I do believe papa would like it better, if Norman were less grave.”",say know think first grief come age manner check subdued spirit have little pleasure thing mean clergyman act sort consecration many thing innocent believe papa like good grave 
95,"“Yes,” said Meta, remembering the Sunday talk, “but still, he would not be all he is--so different from others--”",say remember talk different other 
96,"“Of course, I don’t mean less good, only, less grave,” said Ethel, “and certainly less nervous. But, perhaps, it is a good thing; dear mamma thought his talents would have been a greater temptation than they seem to be, subdued as he has been. I only meant that you must not condemn all that Norman does not do. Now, goodnight.”",course mean good grave say nervous good thing dear mamma think talent great temptation seem subdued mean condemn do goodnight 
97,"Very different were the feelings with which those two young girls stretched themselves in their beds that night. Margaret Rivers’s innocent, happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation. Admiration, sympathy, and the exultation for him, which he would not feel for himself, drew little Meta entirely out of herself--a self that never held her much. She was proud of the slender thread of connection between them; she was confident that his vague fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive mind, and, as she fell sound asleep, she murmured broken lines of Decius, mixed with promises not to look.",different feeling young girl stretch bed night innocent happy little heart take contemplation admiration sympathy exultation feel draw little self hold much proud slender thread connection confident vague fancy scruple sensitive mind fall sound asleep murmure break line mix promise look 
98,"Etheldred heard them, for there was no sleep for her. She had a parley to hold with herself, and to accuse her own feelings of having been unkind, ungrateful, undutiful towards her father. What had a fit of vanity brought her to? that she should have been teased by what would naturally have been her greatest delight! her father’s pleasure in being with her.

99,"At first, Ethel blamed herself for her secret impatience, but another conviction crossed her, and not an unpleasing one, though it made her cheeks tingle with maidenly shame, at having called it up. Throughout this week, Norman Ogilvie had certainly sought her out. He had looked disappointed this evening--there was no doubt that he was attracted by her--by her, plain, awkward Ethel! Such a perception assuredly never gave so much pleasure to a beauty as it did to Ethel, who had always believed herself far less good-looking than she really was. It was a gleam of delight, and, though she set herself to scold it down, the conviction was elastic, and always leaped up again.",blame secret impatience conviction cross unpleasing one make cheek tingle maidenly shame call week seek look disappointed evening be doubt attract plain awkward perception give much pleasure beauty do believe good look gleam delight set scold conviction elastic leap 
100,"That resolution came before her, but it had been unspoken; it could not be binding, and, if her notion were really right, the misty brilliant future of mutual joy dazzled her! But there was another side: her father oppressed and lonely, Margaret ill and pining, Mary, neither companion nor authority, the children running wild; and she, who had mentally vowed never to forsake her father, far away, enjoying her own happiness. “Ah! that resolve had seemed easy enough when it was made, when,”  thought Ethel, “I fancied no one could care for me!

101,"It was a great struggle--on one side there was the deceitful guise of modesty, telling her it was absurd to give so much importance to the kindness of the first cousin with whom she had ever been thrown; there was the dislike to vex Flora to make a discussion, and break up the party. There was the desire to hear the concert, to go to the breakfast at ---- College, to return round by Warwick Castle, and Kenilworth, as designed. Should she lose all this for a mere flattering fancy? She, who had laughed at Miss Boulder, for imagining every one who spoke to her was smitten. What reason could she assign? It would be simply ridiculous, and unkind--and it was so very pleasant. Mr. Ogilvie would be too wise to think of so incongruous a connection, which would be so sure to displease his parents. It was more absurd than ever to think of it.

102,"That was a candid heart which owned that its own repugnance to accept this disparity as an objection, was an additional evidence that she ought to flee from further intercourse. She believed that no harm was done yet; she was sure that she loved her father better than anything else in the world, and whilst she did so, it was best to preserve her heart for him. Widowed as he was, she knew that he would sorely miss her, and that for years to come, she should be necessary at home. She had better come away while it would cost only a slight pang, for that it was pain to leave Norman Ogilvie, was symptom enough of the need of not letting her own silly heart go further.

103,"“I will go home with papa!” was the ultimatum reached by each chain of mental reasonings, and borne in after each short prayer for guidance, as Ethel tossed about listening to the perpetual striking of all the Oxford clocks, until daylight had begun to shine in; when she fell asleep, and was only waked by Meta, standing over her with a sponge, looking very mischievous, as she reminded her of their appointment with Dr. May, to go to the early service in New College Chapel.",go papa ultimatum reach chain mental reasoning borne short prayer guidance toss listen perpetual strike clock daylight begin shine fall asleep wake stand sponge look mischievous remind appointment go early service new

Dr. May agreed with Flora that it was no worse than before, and though they now thought Ethel’s return desirable, on Margaret’s account, it would be better not to add to the shock by a sudden arrival, especially as they took in no daily paper at home.

There was the swarm of gay ladies around them, and beneath the area, fast being paved with heads, black, brown, gray, and bald, a surging living sea, where Meta soon pointed out Dr. May and George; the mere sight of such masses of people was curious and interesting, reminding Ethel of Cherry Elwood having once shocked her by saying the Whit-Monday club was the most beautiful sight in the whole year. And above! that gallery of trampling undergraduates, and more than trampling! Ethel and Meta could, at first, have found it in their hearts to be frightened at those thundering shouts, but the young ladies were usually of opinions so similar, that the louder grew the cheers, the more they laughed and exulted, so carried along that no cares could be remembered.",inch inch step time lady land crowd own sex pioneer emerge bench shake seat be swarm gay lady area paved head black brown gray bald surge living sea point mere sight such mass person curious interesting remind shock say club beautiful sight whole year gallery trampling undergraduate more trample first find heart frighten thunder shout young lady opinion similar louder grow cheer more laugh exult carry care remember

In time, however, Meta saw the spectacles removed, and George looking straight up, and she drew down her veil, and took hold of Flora’s hand, and Ethel flushed like a hot coal. Nevertheless, all contrived to see a tall figure, with face much flushed, and hands moving nervously. The world was tired, and people were departing, so that the first lines were lost, perhaps a satisfaction to Norman; but his voice soon cleared and became louder, his eyes lighted, and Ethel knew the “funny state” had come to his relief--people’s attention was arrested--there was no more going away.",youth make appearance rostrum good deal ensue hope tired time see spectacle remove look draw veil take hold hand flush hot coal contrived see tall figure face flush hand move world tired person depart first line lose satisfaction voice clear become louder eye light know funny state come relief person attention arrest be more go

Mr. Ogilvie sat next to her, told her all the names, and quizzed the dignitaries, but she had a sense of depression, and did not wish to enter into the usual strain of banter. He dropped his lively tone, and drew her out about Harry, till she was telling eagerly of her dear sailor brother, and found him so sympathising and considerate, that she did not like him less; though she felt her intercourse with him a sort of intoxication, that would only make it the worse for her by-and-by.",bind great luncheon college survey principal correspond sit tell name quizz dignitary have sense depression wish enter usual strain banter drop lively tone draw tell dear sailor brother find sympathising considerate like less feel intercourse sort intoxication make bad

When they returned to their inn they found Norman looking fagged, but relieved, half asleep on the sofa, with a novel in his hand. He roused himself as they came in, and, to avoid any compliments on his own performance, began, “Well, Ethel, are you ready for the ball?”",whole luncheon walk garden be beautiful horticultural show prompt say quasi-privacy eve departure keep resolution think unwarrantable experiment return inn find look fagged relieve half asleep sofa novel hand rouse come avoid compliment own performance begin ready ball

He had seen the Alcestis, knew Captain Gordon, and spoke of him as one of the safest people in the world. Had his acquaintance extended to lieutenants and midshipmen, it would have been perfect; as it was, the tidings brought back the blood to Norman’s cheek, and the light to his eye.",add luncheon seat honorary doctor naval captain make discovery scout notion harm befall give manner reassure supposition detention add believe australian paper report take see know speak safe person world acquaintance extend lieutenant midshipmen perfect tiding bring blood cheek light eye
