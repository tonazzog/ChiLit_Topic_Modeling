1,CHAPTER 3. BEING DETECTIVES,chapter detection 
2,"The next thing that happened to us was very interesting. It was as real as the half-crowns--not just pretending. I shall try to write it as like a real book as I can. Of course we have read Mr Sherlock Holmes, as well as the yellow-covered books with pictures outside that are so badly printed; and you get them for fourpence-halfpenny at the bookstall when the corners of them are beginning to curl up and get dirty, with people looking to see how the story ends when they are waiting for trains. I think this is most unfair to the boy at the bookstall. The books are written by a gentleman named Gaboriau, and Albert’s uncle says they are the worst translations in the world--and written in vile English. Of course they’re not like Kipling, but they’re jolly good stories. And we had just been reading a book by Dick Diddlington--that’s not his right name, but I know all about libel actions, so I shall not say what his name is really, because his books are rot. Only they put it into our heads to do what I am going to narrate.",next thing happen interesting real half crown pretend try write real book course read yellow cover book picture print get fourpence halfpenny bookstall corner begin curl get dirty person look see story end wait train think unfair boy bookstall book write gentleman name uncle say bad translation world write vile course jolly good story read book right name know libel action say name book rot put head do go narrate 
3,"It was in September, and we were not to go to the seaside because it is so expensive, even if you go to Sheerness, where it is all tin cans and old boots and no sand at all. But every one else went, even the people next door--not Albert’s side, but the other. Their servant told Eliza they were all going to Scarborough, and next day sure enough all the blinds were down and the shutters up, and the milk was not left any more. There is a big horse-chestnut tree between their garden and ours, very useful for getting conkers out of and for making stuff to rub on your chilblains. This prevented our seeing whether the blinds were down at the back as well, but Dicky climbed to the top of the tree and looked, and they were.",go seaside expensive go tin can old boot sand one else go person next door side other servant tell go next day sure blind shutter milk leave more be big horse chestnut tree garden useful get conker make stuff rub chilblain prevent see blind back climb top tree look 
4,"It was jolly hot weather, and very stuffy indoors--we used to play a good deal in the garden. We made a tent out of the kitchen clothes-horse and some blankets off our beds, and though it was quite as hot in the tent as in the house it was a very different sort of hotness. Albert’s uncle called it the Turkish Bath. It is not nice to be kept from the seaside, but we know that we have much to be thankful for. We might be poor little children living in a crowded alley where even at summer noon hardly a ray of sunlight penetrates; clothed in rags and with bare feet--though I do not mind holes in my clothes myself, and bare feet would not be at all bad in this sort of weather. Indeed we do, sometimes, when we are playing at things which require it. It was shipwrecked mariners that day, I remember, and we were all in the blanket tent. We had just finished eating the things we had saved, at the peril of our lives, from the st-sinking vessel. They were rather nice things. Two-pennyworth of coconut candy--it was got in Greenwich, where it is four ounces a penny--three apples, some macaroni--the straight sort that is so useful to suck things through--some raw rice, and a large piece of cold suet pudding that Alice nicked from the larder when she went to get the rice and macaroni. And when we had finished some one said--",jolly hot weather stuffy use play good deal garden make tent kitchen clothes horse blanket bed hot tent house different sort hotness uncle call turkish nice keep seaside know have much thankful poor little child live crowded alley summer noon ray sunlight penetrate cloth rag bare foot mind hole clothes bare foot bad sort weather play thing require shipwreck mariner day remember blanket tent finish eat thing save peril life sink vessel nice thing pennyworth coconut candy get ounce penny apple macaroni straight sort useful suck thing raw rice large piece cold suet pudding nick larder go get rice macaroni finish one say 
5,‘I should like to be a detective.’,like detective 
6,"I wish to be quite fair, but I cannot remember exactly who said it. Oswald thinks he said it, and Dora says it was Dicky, but Oswald is too much of a man to quarrel about a little thing like that.",wish fair remember say think say say much man quarrel little thing 
7,"‘I should like to be a detective,’ said--perhaps it was Dicky, but I think not--‘and find out strange and hidden crimes.’",like detective say think find strange hidden crime 
8,"‘You have to be much cleverer than you are,’ said H. O.",have cleverer say 
9,"‘Not so very,’ Alice said, ‘because when you’ve read the books you know what the things mean: the red hair on the handle of the knife, or the grains of white powder on the velvet collar of the villain’s overcoat. I believe we could do it.’",say read book know thing mean red hair handle knife grain white powder velvet collar villain overcoat believe do 
10,"‘I shouldn’t like to have anything to do with murders,’ said Dora; ‘somehow it doesn’t seem safe--’",like have do murder say seem safe 
11,"‘And it always ends in the poor murderer being hanged,’ said Alice.",end poor murderer hang say 
12,"We explained to her why murderers have to be hanged, but she only said, ‘I don’t care. I’m sure no one would ever do murdering _twice_. Think of the blood and things, and what you would see when you woke up in the night! I shouldn’t mind being a detective to lie in wait for a gang of coiners, now, and spring upon them unawares, and secure them--single-handed, you know, or with only my faithful bloodhound.’",explain murderer have hang say care sure do murdering think blood thing see wake night mind detective lie wait gang coiner spring secure single handed know faithful bloodhound 
13,"She stroked Pincher’s ears, but he had gone to sleep because he knew well enough that all the suet pudding was finished. He is a very sensible dog. ‘You always get hold of the wrong end of the stick,’ Oswald said. ‘You can’t choose what crimes you’ll be a detective about. You just have to get a suspicious circumstance, and then you look for a clue and follow it up. Whether it turns out a murder or a missing will is just a fluke.’",stroke ear go sleep know suet pudding finish sensible dog get hold wrong end stick say choose crime detective have get suspicious circumstance look clue follow turn murder missing will fluke 
14,"‘That’s one way,’ Dicky said. ‘Another is to get a paper and find two advertisements or bits of news that fit. Like this: “Young Lady Missing,” and then it tells about all the clothes she had on, and the gold locket she wore, and the colour of her hair, and all that; and then in another piece of the paper you see, “Gold locket found,” and then it all comes out.’",way say get paper find advertisement bit news fit young tell clothes have gold locket wear colour hair piece paper see gold locket find come 
15,"We sent H. O. for the paper at once, but we could not make any of the things fit in. The two best were about how some burglars broke into a place in Holloway where they made preserved tongues and invalid delicacies, and carried off a lot of them. And on another page there was, ‘Mysterious deaths in Holloway.’",send paper make thing fit good burglar break place make preserve tongue invalid delicacy carry lot page be mysterious death 
16,"Oswald thought there was something in it, and so did Albert’s uncle when we asked him, but the others thought not, so Oswald agreed to drop it. Besides, Holloway is a long way off. All the time we were talking about the paper Alice seemed to be thinking about something else, and when we had done she said--",think be do uncle ask other think agree drop long way time talk paper seem think else do say 
17,"‘I believe we might be detectives ourselves, but I should not like to get anybody into trouble.’",believe detective like get trouble 
18,‘Not murderers or robbers?’ Dicky asked.,murderer robber ask 
19,"‘It wouldn’t be murderers,’ she said; ‘but I _have_ noticed something strange. Only I feel a little frightened. Let’s ask Albert’s uncle first.’",murderer say notice strange feel little frighten let ask uncle 
20,"Alice is a jolly sight too fond of asking grown-up people things. And we all said it was tommyrot, and she was to tell us.",jolly sight fond ask grow person thing say tommyrot tell 
21,"‘Well, promise you won’t do anything without me,’ Alice said, and we promised. Then she said--",promise do say promise say 
22,"‘This is a dark secret, and any one who thinks it is better not to be involved in a career of crime-discovery had better go away ere yet it be too late.’",dark secret one think good involve career crime discovery good go late 
23,"So Dora said she had had enough of tents, and she was going to look at the shops. H. O. went with her because he had twopence to spend. They thought it was only a game of Alice’s but Oswald knew by the way she spoke. He can nearly always tell. And when people are not telling the truth Oswald generally knows by the way they look with their eyes. Oswald is not proud of being able to do this. He knows it is through no merit of his own that he is much cleverer than some people.",say have enough tent go look shop go have twopence spend think game know way speak tell person tell truth know way look eye proud able do know merit own cleverer person 
24,"When they had gone, the rest of us got closer together and said--",go rest get close say 
25,‘Now then.’,
26,"‘Well,’ Alice said, ‘you know the house next door? The people have gone to Scarborough. And the house is shut up. But last night _I saw a light in the windows_.’",say know house next door person go house shut last night see light windows_ 
27,"We asked her how and when, because her room is in the front, and she couldn’t possibly have seen. And then she said--",ask room front see say 
28,‘I’ll tell you if you boys will promise not ever to go fishing again without me.’,tell boy promise go fishing 
29,So we had to promise.,have promise 
30,Then she said--,say 
31,"‘It was last night. I had forgotten to feed my rabbits and I woke up and remembered it. And I was afraid I should find them dead in the morning, like Oswald did.’",last night forget feed rabbit wake remember afraid find dead morning 
32,"‘It wasn’t my fault,’ Oswald said; ‘there was something the matter with the beasts. I fed them right enough.’",fault say be matter beast feed 
33,"Alice said she didn’t mean that, and she went on--",say mean go 
34,"‘I came down into the garden, and I saw a light in the house, and dark figures moving about. I thought perhaps it was burglars, but Father hadn’t come home, and Eliza had gone to bed, so I couldn’t do anything. Only I thought perhaps I would tell the rest of you.’",come garden see light house dark figure move think burglar come go bed do think tell rest 
35,"‘Why didn’t you tell us this morning?’ Noel asked. And Alice explained that she did not want to get any one into trouble, even burglars. ‘But we might watch to-night,’ she said, ‘and see if we see the light again.’",tell morning ask explain want get one trouble burglar watch night say see see light 
36,"‘They might have been burglars,’ Noel said. He was sucking the last bit of his macaroni. ‘You know the people next door are very grand. They won’t know us--and they go out in a real private carriage sometimes. And they have an “At Home” day, and people come in cabs. I daresay they have piles of plate and jewellery and rich brocades, and furs of price and things like that. Let us keep watch to-night.’",burglar say suck last bit macaroni know person next door grand know go real private carriage have day person come cab daresay have pile plate jewellery rich brocade fur price thing let keep watch night

38,"‘You mean coiners,’ said Oswald at once. ‘I wonder what the reward is for setting the police on their track?’",mean coiner say wonder reward set police track 
39,"Dicky thought it ought to be something fat, because coiners are always a desperate gang; and the machinery they make the coins with is so heavy and handy for knocking down detectives.",think fat coiner desperate gang machinery make coin heavy handy knock detective 
40,"Then it was tea-time, and we went in; and Dora and H. O. had clubbed their money together and bought a melon; quite a big one, and only a little bit squashy at one end. It was very good, and then we washed the seeds and made things with them and with pins and cotton. And nobody said any more about watching the house next door.",tea time go clubb money buy melon big one little bit squashy end good wash seed make thing pin cotton say more watch house next door 
41,"Only when we went to bed Dicky took off his coat and waistcoat, but he stopped at his braces, and said--",go bed take coat waistcoat stop brace say 
42,‘What about the coiners?’,coiner 
43,"Oswald had taken off his collar and tie, and he was just going to say the same, so he said, ‘Of course I meant to watch, only my collar’s rather tight, so I thought I’d take it off first.’",take collar tie go say same say course mean watch collar tight think take 
44,"Dicky said he did not think the girls ought to be in it, because there might be danger, but Oswald reminded him that they had promised Alice, and that a promise is a sacred thing, even when you’d much rather not. So Oswald got Alice alone under pretence of showing her a caterpillar--Dora does not like them, and she screamed and ran away when Oswald offered to show it her. Then Oswald explained, and Alice agreed to come and watch if she could. This made us later than we ought to have been, because Alice had to wait till Dora was quiet and then creep out very slowly, for fear of the boards creaking. The girls sleep with their room-door open for fear of burglars. Alice had kept on her clothes under her nightgown when Dora wasn’t looking, and presently we got down, creeping past Father’s study, and out at the glass door that leads on to the veranda and the iron steps into the garden. And we went down very quietly, and got into the chestnut-tree; and then I felt that we had only been playing what Albert’s uncle calls our favourite instrument--I mean the Fool. For the house next door was as dark as dark. Then suddenly we heard a sound--it came from the gate at the end of the garden. All the gardens have gates; they lead into a kind of lane that runs behind them. It is a sort of back way, very convenient when you don’t want to say exactly where you are going. We heard the gate at the end of the next garden click, and Dicky nudged Alice so that she would have fallen out of the tree if it had not been for Oswald’s extraordinary presence of mind. Oswald squeezed Alice’s arm tight, and we all looked; and the others were rather frightened because really we had not exactly expected anything to happen except perhaps a light. But now a muffled figure, shrouded in a dark cloak, came swiftly up the path of the next-door garden. And we could see that under its cloak the figure carried a mysterious burden. The figure was dressed to look like a woman in a sailor hat.",say think girl be danger remind promise promise sacred thing get pretence show caterpillar like scream run offer show explain agree come watch make have wait quiet creep fear board creak girl sleep room door open fear burglar keep clothes nightgown look get creep study glass door lead veranda iron step garden go get chestnut tree feel play uncle call favourite instrument mean house next door dark dark hear sound come gate end garden garden have gate lead kind lane run sort back way convenient want say go hear gate end next garden click nudge fall tree extraordinary presence mind squeeze arm tight look other frighten expect happen light muffled figure shroud dark cloak come path next door garden see cloak figure carry mysterious burden figure dress look woman sailor hat 
45,"We held our breath as it passed under the tree where we were, and then it tapped very gently on the back door and was let in, and then a light appeared in the window of the downstairs back breakfast-room. But the shutters were up.",hold breath pass tree tap back door let light appear window downstairs back breakfast room shutter 
46,"Dicky said, ‘My eye!’ and wouldn’t the others be sick to think they hadn’t been in this! But Alice didn’t half like it--and as she is a girl I do not blame her. Indeed, I thought myself at first that perhaps it would be better to retire for the present, and return later with a strongly armed force.",say eye other sick think half girl blame think first good retire present return armed force 
47,"‘It’s not burglars,’ Alice whispered; ‘the mysterious stranger was bringing things in, not taking them out. They must be coiners--and oh, Oswald!--don’t let’s! The things they coin with must hurt very much. Do let’s go to bed!’",burglar whisper mysterious stranger bring thing take coiner let thing coin hurt let go bed 
48,But Dicky said he was going to see; if there was a reward for finding out things like this he would like to have the reward.,say go see be reward find thing like have reward 
49,"‘They locked the back door,’ he whispered, ‘I heard it go. And I could look in quite well through the holes in the shutters and be back over the wall long before they’d got the door open, even if they started to do it at once.’",lock back door whisper hear go look hole shutter wall get door open start do 
50,"There were holes at the top of the shutters the shape of hearts, and the yellow light came out through them as well as through the chinks of the shutters.",be hole top shutter shape heart yellow light come chink shutter 
51,"Oswald said if Dicky went he should, because he was the eldest; and Alice said, ‘If any one goes it ought to be me, because I thought of it.’",say go old say one go think 
52,"So Oswald said, ‘Well, go then’; and she said, ‘Not for anything!’ And she begged us not to, and we talked about it in the tree till we were all quite hoarse with whispering.",say go say begg talk tree hoarse whisper 
53,At last we decided on a plan of action.,last decide plan action 
54,"Alice was to stay in the tree, and scream ‘Murder!’ if anything happened. Dicky and I were to get down into the next garden and take it in turns to peep.",stay tree scream murder happen get next garden take turn peep 
55,"So we got down as quietly as we could, but the tree made much more noise than it does in the day, and several times we paused, fearing that all was discovered. But nothing happened.",get tree make more noise day several time pause fear discover happen 
56,"There was a pile of red flower-pots under the window and one very large one was on the window-ledge. It seemed as if it was the hand of Destiny had placed it there, and the geranium in it was dead, and there was nothing to stop your standing on it--so Oswald did. He went first because he is the eldest, and though Dicky tried to stop him because he thought of it first it could not be, on account of not being able to say anything.",be pile red flower pot window large one window ledge seem hand place geranium dead be stop standing go old try stop think account able say 
57,"So Oswald stood on the flower-pot and tried to look through one of the holes. He did not really expect to see the coiners at their fell work, though he had pretended to when we were talking in the tree. But if he had seen them pouring the base molten metal into tin moulds the shape of half-crowns he would not have been half so astonished as he was at the spectacle now revealed.",stand flower pot try look hole expect see coiner fall work pretend talk tree see pour base molten metal tin mould shape half crown half astonished spectacle reveal 
58,"At first he could see little, because the hole had unfortunately been made a little too high, so that the eye of the detective could only see the Prodigal Son in a shiny frame on the opposite wall. But Oswald held on to the window-frame and stood on tiptoe and then he _saw_.",first see little hole make little high eye detective see shiny frame opposite wall hold window frame stand tiptoe 
59,"There was no furnace, and no base metal, no bearded men in leathern aprons with tongs and things, but just a table with a table-cloth on it for supper, and a tin of salmon and a lettuce and some bottled beer. And there on a chair was the cloak and the hat of the mysterious stranger, and the two people sitting at the table were the two youngest grown-up daughters of the lady next door, and one of them was saying--",be furnace base metal bearded man leathern apron tong thing table table cloth supper tin salmon lettuce bottled beer chair cloak hat mysterious stranger person sit table young grow daughter lady next door say 
60,"‘So I got the salmon three-halfpence cheaper, and the lettuces are only six a penny in the Broadway, just fancy! We must save as much as ever we can on our housekeeping money if we want to go away decent next year.’",get salmon halfpence cheap lettuce penny fancy save much housekeeping money want go decent next year 
61,"And the other said, ‘I wish we could _all_ go _every_ year, or else--Really, I almost wish--’",other say wish go _every_ year wish 
62,"And all the time Oswald was looking Dicky was pulling at his jacket to make him get down and let Dicky have a squint. And just as she said ‘I almost,’ Dicky pulled too hard and Oswald felt himself toppling on the giddy verge of the big flower-pots. Putting forth all his strength our hero strove to recover his equi-what’s-its-name, but it was now lost beyond recall.",time look pull jacket make get let have squint say pull feel topple giddy verge big flower pot put strength hero strive recover equi name lose recall 
63,"‘You’ve done it this time!’ he said, then he fell heavily among the flower-pots piled below. He heard them crash and rattle and crack, and then his head struck against an iron pillar used for holding up the next-door veranda. His eyes closed and he knew no more.",do time say fall flower pot pile hear crash rattle crack head strike iron pillar use hold next door veranda eye close know more 
64,"Now you will perhaps expect that at this moment Alice would have cried ‘Murder!’ If you think so you little know what girls are. Directly she was left alone in that tree she made a bolt to tell Albert’s uncle all about it and bring him to our rescue in case the coiner’s gang was a very desperate one. And just when I fell, Albert’s uncle was getting over the wall. Alice never screamed at all when Oswald fell, but Dicky thinks he heard Albert’s uncle say, ‘Confound those kids!’ which would not have been kind or polite, so I hope he did not say it.",expect moment cry murder think know girl leave alone tree make bolt tell uncle bring rescue case coiner gang desperate one fall uncle get wall scream fall think hear uncle say confound kid kind polite hope say 
65,"The people next door did not come out to see what the row was. Albert’s uncle did not wait for them to come out. He picked up Oswald and carried the insensible body of the gallant young detective to the wall, laid it on the top, and then climbed over and bore his lifeless burden into our house and put it on the sofa in Father’s study. Father was out, so we needn’t have _crept_ so when we were getting into the garden. Then Oswald was restored to consciousness, and his head tied up, and sent to bed, and next day there was a lump on his young brow as big as a turkey’s egg, and very uncomfortable.",person next door come see row uncle wait come pick carry insensible body gallant young detective wall lay top climb bear lifeless burden house put sofa study father have _crept_ get garden restore consciousness head tie send bed next day be lump young brow big turkey egg uncomfortable 
66,"Albert’s uncle came in next day and talked to each of us separately. To Oswald he said many unpleasant things about ungentlemanly to spy on ladies, and about minding your own business; and when I began to tell him what I had heard he told me to shut up, and altogether he made me more uncomfortable than the bump did.",uncle come next day talk say many unpleasant thing spy lady mind own business begin tell hear tell shut make uncomfortable bump 
67,"Oswald did not say anything to any one, but next day, as the shadows of eve were falling, he crept away, and wrote on a piece of paper, ‘I want to speak to you,’ and shoved it through the hole like a heart in the top of the next-door shutters. And the youngest young lady put an eye to the heart-shaped hole, and then opened the shutter and said ‘Well?’ very crossly. Then Oswald said--",say one next day shadow eve fall creep write piece paper want speak shove hole heart top next door shutter young young lady put eye heart shape hole open shutter say say 
68,"‘I am very sorry, and I beg your pardon. We wanted to be detectives, and we thought a gang of coiners infested your house, so we looked through your window last night. I saw the lettuce, and I heard what you said about the salmon being three-halfpence cheaper, and I know it is very dishonourable to pry into other people’s secrets, especially ladies’, and I never will again if you will forgive me this once.’",sorry beg pardon want detective think gang coiner infest house look window last night see lettuce hear say salmon halfpence cheap know dishonourable pry other person secret lady forgive 
69,"Then the lady frowned and then she laughed, and then she said--",lady frown laugh say

71,"And then she talked to me a bit, and presently she said she and her sister had not wished people to know they were at home, because--And then she stopped short and grew very red, and I said, ‘I thought you were all at Scarborough; your servant told Eliza so. Why didn’t you want people to know you were at home?’",talk bit say sister wish person know home stop short grow red say think servant tell want person know home 
72,"The lady got redder still, and then she laughed and said--",lady get redder laugh say 
73,"‘Never mind the reason why. I hope your head doesn’t hurt much. Thank you for your nice, manly little speech. _You’ve_ nothing to be ashamed of, at any rate.’ Then she kissed me, and I did not mind. And then she said, ‘Run away now, dear. I’m going to--I’m going to pull up the blinds and open the shutters, and I want to do it at _once_, before it gets dark, so that every one can see we’re at home, and not at Scarborough.’",mind reason hope head hurt much thank nice manly little speech hve_ ashamed rate kiss mind say run dear go go pull blind open shutter want do get dark one see home
