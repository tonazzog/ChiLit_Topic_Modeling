2," IT is very hard, when you have been accustomed to go to the seaside every summer ever since you were quite little, to be made to stay in London just because an aunt and an uncle choose to want to come and stay at your house to see the Royal Academy and go to the summer sales.",hard accustom go seaside summer little make stay aunt uncle choose want come stay house see royal go summer sale 
3,"Selim and Thomasina felt that it was very hard indeed. And aunt and uncle were not the nice kind, either. If it had been Aunt Emma, who dressed dolls and told fairy-tales—or Uncle Reggie, who took you to the Crystal Palace, and gave you five bob at a time, and never even asked what you spent it on, it would have been different. But it was Uncle Thomas and Aunt Selina.",feel hard aunt uncle nice kind dress doll tell fairy tale take give bob time ask spend different 
4,"Aunt Selina was all beady, and sat bolt upright, and told you to mind what you were told, and Selim had been named after her—as near as they could get. And Uncle Thomas was the one Thomasina had been named after: he was deaf, and he always told you what the moral of everything was, and the housemaid said he was “near.”",beady sit bolt tell mind tell name get one name deaf tell moral housemaid say 
5,"“I know he is, worse luck,” said Thomasina.",know bad luck say 
6,"“I mean, miss,” explained the housemaid, “he’s none too free with his chink.”",mean miss explain housemaid free chink 
7,"Selim groaned. “He never gave me but a shilling in his life,” said he, “and that turned out to be bad when I tried to change it at the ginger-beer shop.”",groan give shilling life say turn bad try change ginger beer shop 
8,"The children could not understand why this aunt and uncle were allowed to interfere with everything as they did: and they quite made up their minds that when they were grown up they would never allow an aunt or an uncle to cross their doorsteps. They never thought—poor, dear little things—that some day they would grow up to be aunts and uncles in their turn, or, at least, one of each.",child understand aunt uncle allow interfere make mind grow allow aunt uncle cross doorstep think poor dear little thing day grow aunt uncle turn least 
9,"It was very hot in London that year: the pavement was like hot pie, and the asphalt was like hot pudding, and there was a curious wind that collected dust and straw and dirty paper, and then got tired of its collection, and threw it away in respectable people’s areas and front gardens. The blind in the nursery had never been fixed up since the day when the children took it down to make a drop-scene for a play they were going to write and never did. So the hot afternoon sun came burning in through the window, and the children got hotter and hotter, and crosser and crosser, till at last Selim slapped Thomasina’s arms till she cried, and Thomasina kicked Selim’s legs till he screamed.",hot year pavement hot pie asphalt hot pudding be curious wind collect dust straw dirty paper get tired collection throw respectable person area front garden blind nursery fix day child take make drop scene play go write hot afternoon sun come burn window child get hot hot crosser crosser last slap arm cry kick leg scream 
10,"Then they sat down in different corners of the nursery and cried, and called each other names, and said they wished they were dead. This is very naughty indeed, as, of course, you know; but you must remember how hot it was.",sit different corner nursery cry call other name say wish dead naughty course know remember hot 
11,"When they had called each other all the names they could think of, Thomasina said, suddenly, “All right, Silly,” (that was Selim’s pet name)—“cheer up.”",call other name think say right pet name cheer 
12,"“It’s too hot to cheer up,” said Selim, gloomily.",hot cheer say 
13,"“We’ve been very naughty,” said Thomasina, rubbing her eyes with the paint rag, “but it’s all the heat. I heard Aunt Selina telling mother the weather wore her nerves to fiddle-strings. That just meant she was cross.”",naughty say rub eye paint rag heat hear tell mother weather wear nerve fiddle string mean cross 
14,"“Then it’s not _our_ fault,” said Selim. “People say be good and you’ll be happy. Uncle Reggy says, ‘Be happy, and perhaps you’ll be good.’ _I_ could be good if I was happy.”",fault say person say good happy say happy good good happy 
15,"“So could I,” said Thomasina.",say 
16,"“What _would_ make you happy?” said a thick, wheezy voice from the toy cupboard, and out rolled the big green and red india-rubber ball that Aunt Emma had sent them last week. They had not played with it much, because the garden was so hot and sunny—and when they wanted to play with it in the street, on the shady side, Aunt Selina had said it was not like respectable children, so they weren’t allowed.",_would_ make happy say thick wheezy voice toy cupboard roll big green red india rubber ball send last week play much garden hot sunny want play street shady side say respectable child allow 
17,"Now the Ball rolled out very slowly—and the bright light on its new paint seemed to make it wink at them. You will think that they were surprised to hear a ball speak. Not at all. As you grow up, and more and more strange things happen to you, you will find that the more astonishing a thing is the less it surprises you. (I wonder why this is. Think it over, and write and tell me what you think.)",roll bright light new paint seem make wink think surprise hear ball speak grow more strange thing happen find astonish thing less surprise wonder think write tell think 
18,"Selim stood up, and said, “Halloa”; but that was only out of politeness. Thomasina answered the Ball’s question.",stand say politeness answer question 
19,"“We want to be at the seaside—and no aunts—and none of the things we don’t like—and no uncles, of course,” she said.",want seaside aunt thing like uncle course say 
20,"“Well,” said the Ball, “if you think you can be good, why not set me bouncing?”",say think good set bounce 
21,"“We’re not allowed in here,” said Thomasina, “because of the crinkly ornaments people give me on my birthdays.”",allow say crinkly ornament person give birthday 
22,"“Well, the street then,” said the Ball; “the nice shady side.”",street say nice shady side 
23,"“It’s not like respectable children,” said Selim sadly.",respectable child say 
24,"The Ball laughed. If you have never heard an india-rubber ball laugh you won’t understand. It’s the sort of quicker, quicker, quicker, softer, softer, softer chuckle of a bounce that it gives when it’s settling down when you’re tired of bouncing it.",laugh hear rubber ball laugh understand sort quick quick quick softer softer softer chuckle bounce give settle tired bounce 
25,"“The garden, then,” it said.",garden say 
26,"“I don’t mind, if you’ll go on talking,” said Selim kindly.",mind go talk say 
27,"So they took the Ball down into the garden and began to bounce it in the sun, on the dry, yellowy grass of the lawn.",take ball garden begin bounce sun dry yellowy grass lawn 
28,"“Come on,” said the Ball. “You do like me!”",come say like 
29,“What?” said the children.,say child 
30,"“Why, do like I do—bounce!” said the Ball. “That’s right—higher, higher, higher!”",do bounce say right high high high 
31,"For then and there the two children had begun bouncing as if their feet were india-rubber balls, and you have no idea what a delicious sensation that gives you.",child begin bounce foot india rubber ball have idea delicious sensation give 
32,"“Higher, higher,” cried the green and red ball, bouncing excitedly. “Now, follow me, higher, higher.” And off it bounced down the blackened gravel of the path, and the children bounced after it, shrieking with delight at the new feeling. They bounced over the wall—all three of them—and the children looked back just in time to see Uncle Thomas tapping at the window, and saying, “Don’t.”",high high cry green red ball bounce follow high high bounce blacken gravel path child bounce shriek delight new feeling bounce wall child look time see tap window say 
33,"You have not the least idea how glorious it is to feel full of bouncibleness; so that, instead of dragging one foot after the other, as you do when you feel tired or naughty, you bounce along, and every time your feet touch the ground you bounce higher, and all without taking any trouble or tiring yourself. You have, perhaps, heard of the Greek gentleman who got new strength every time he fell down. His name was Antæus, and I believe he was an india-rubber ball, green on one side where he touched the earth, and red on the other where he felt the sun. But enough of classical research.",have least idea glorious feel full bouncibleness drag foot other do feel tired naughty bounce time foot touch ground bounce high take trouble tiring hear greek gentleman get new strength time fall name believe india rubber ball green side touch earth red other feel sun enough classical research 
34,"Thomasina and Selim bounced away, following the Bouncible Ball. They went over fences and walls, and through parched, dry gardens and burning-hot streets; they passed the region where fields of cabbages and rows of yellow brick cottages mark the division between London and the suburbs. They bounced through the suburbs, dusty and neat, with geraniums in the front gardens, and all the blinds pulled half-way down; and then the lamp-posts in the road got fewer and fewer, and the fields got greener and the hedges thicker—it was real, true country—with lanes instead of roads; and down the lanes the green and red Ball went bouncing, bouncing, bouncing, and the children after it. Thomasina, in her white, starched frock, very prickly round the neck, and Selim, in his every-day sailor-suit, a little tight under the arms. His Sunday one was a size larger. No one seemed to notice them, but they noticed and pitied the children who were being “taken for a walk” in the gritty suburban roads.",bounce follow go fence wall parched dry garden burn hot street pass region field cabbage row yellow brick cottage mark division suburb bounce suburb dusty neat geranium front garden blind pull half lamp post road get few few field get greener hedge thick real true country lane road lane green red go bounce bounce bounce child white starch frock prickly neck day sailor suit little tight arm one size large seem notice notice pity child take walk gritty suburban road

37,“What’s it called?” asked Selim.,call ask 
38,"“It’s called Whereyouwantogoto,” the Ball answered, and on they went. It was a wonderful journey—up and down, looking through the hedges and over them, looking in at the doors of cottages, and then in at the top windows, up and down—bounce—bounce—bounce.",call answer go wonderful journey look hedge look door cottage top window bounce bounce bounce 
39,"And at last they came to the sea. And the Bouncing Ball said, “Here you are! Now be good, for there’s nothing here but the things that make people happy.” And with that he curled himself up like a ball in the shadow of a wet sea-weedy rock, and went to sleep, for he was tired out with his long journey. The children stopped bouncing, and looked about them.",last come sea say good be thing make person happy curl ball shadow wet sea weedy rock go sleep tired long journey child stop bounce look

43,"The children feel exactly as you do when you’ve had the long, hot, dirty train journey—and every one has been so cross about the boxes and the little brown portmanteau that was left behind at the junction—and then when you get to your lodgings you are told that you may run down and have a look at the sea if you’re back by tea time, and mother and nurse will unpack.",child feel do have long hot dirty train journey one cross box little brown portmanteau leave junction get lodging tell run have look sea tea time mother nurse unpack

They ate and ate, and thought of the aunt and uncle at home, and the minced veal and sago pudding, and they were very happy indeed.",lovely lunch lobster ice cream strawberry pine apple toffee hot butter toast ginger beer eat eat think aunt uncle home mince veal sago pudding happy 
62,"Just as they were finishing their lunch they saw a swirling, swishing, splashing commotion in the green sea a little way off, and they tore off their clothes and rushed into the water to see what it was. It was a seal. He was very kind and convenient. He showed them how to swim and dive.",finish lunch see swirl swish splash commotion green sea little tore clothes rush water see seal kind convenient show swim dive 
63,“But won’t it make us ill to bathe so soon after meals? Isn’t it wrong?” asked Thomasina.,make ill bathe meal wrong ask

69,"I am almost sure that it has never been your luck to wear a fur coat that fitted you like a skin, and that could not be spoiled with sand or water, or jam, or bread and milk, or any of the things with which you mess up the nice new clothes your kind relations buy for you. But if you like, you may try to imagine how jolly the little coats were.",sure luck wear fur coat fit skin spoiled sand water jam bread milk thing mess nice new clothes kind relation buy like try imagine jolly little coat 
70,"Thomasina and Selim played all day on the beach, and when they were tired then went into a cave, and found supper—salmon and cucumber, and welsh-rabbit and lemonade—and then they went to bed in a great heap of straw and grass and fern and dead leaves, and all the delightful things you have often wished to sleep in. Only you have never been allowed to.",play day beach tired go cave find supper salmon cucumber welsh rabbit lemonade go bed great heap straw grass fern dead leave delightful thing wish sleep allow 
71,"In the morning there were plum-pudding for breakfast, and roast duck and lemon jelly, and the day passed like a happy dream, only broken by surprising and delightful meals. The Ball woke up and showed them how to play water-polo; and they bounced him on the sand, with shrieks of joy and pleasure. You know, a Ball likes to be bounced by people he is fond of—it is like slapping a friend on the shoulder.",morning be plum pudding breakfast roast duck lemon jelly day pass happy dream break surprising delightful meal wake show play water polo bounce sand shriek joy pleasure know ball like bounce person fond slap friend shoulder

73,"“What will happen if we’re naughty?” Selim asked. The Ball looked very grave, and answered—",happen naughty ask look grave answer 
74,“I must not tell you; and I very strongly advise you not to try to find out.”,tell advise try find

84,"And he curled himself up like a ball in his favourite sleeping-place. The two children crept into their pleasant, soft, sweet nest of straw and leaves and fern and grass, and went to sleep. But Selim was vexed with Thomasina because she had thought of mother before he had, and he said she had taken all the fern—and they went to sleep rather cross. They woke crosser. So far they had both helped to make the bed every morning, but to-day neither wanted to.",curl ball favourite sleeping place child creep pleasant soft sweet nest straw leave fern grass go sleep vex think mother have say take fern go sleep cross wake crosser help make bed morning day want

92,"They cheered up towards dinner-time—it was roast pigeons that day and bread sauce, and whitebait and syllabubs—and for the rest of the day they were as good as gold, and very polite to the Ball. Selim told it all about the dreadful apparition of the housemaid, and it shook its head (I know _you’ve_ never seen a ball do that, and very likely you never will) and said—",cheer dinner time roast pigeon day bread sauce whitebait syllabub rest day good gold polite tell dreadful apparition housemaid shake head know see ball do likely say 
93,"“My Bouncible Boy, you may be happy here for ever and ever if you’re contented and good. Otherwise—well, it’s a quarter to seven—you’ve got to go.”",happy contented good quarter get go 
94,"And, sure enough, they had to. And the housemaid put them to bed, and washed them with yellow soap, and some of it got in their eyes. And she lit a night-light, and sat with them till they went to sleep, so that they couldn’t talk, and were ever so much longer getting to sleep than they would have been if she had not been there. And the beds were iron, with mattresses and hot, stuffy, fluffy sheets and many more new blankets than they wanted.",have housemaid put bed wash yellow soap get eye light night light sit go sleep talk get sleep bed iron mattress hot stuffy fluffy sheet many more new blanket want 
95,"The next day they got out as early as they could and played water football with the seal and the Bouncible Ball, and when dinner-time came it was lobster and ices. But Thomasina was in a bad temper. She said, “I wish it was duck.” And before the words had left her lips it was cold mutton and rice-pudding, and they had to sit up to table and eat it properly too, and the housemaid came round to see that they didn’t leave any bits on the edges of their plates, or talk with their mouths full.",next day get play water football seal dinner time come lobster ice bad temper say wish duck word leave lip cold mutton rice pudding have sit table eat housemaid come see leave bit edge plate talk mouth full 
96,"There were no more really nice meals after that, only the sort of things you get at home. But it is possible to be happy even without really nice meals. But you have to be very careful. The days went by pleasantly enough. All the sea and land creatures were most kind and attentive. The seal taught them all it knew, and was always ready to play with them. The star-fish taught them astronomy, and the jelly-fish taught them fancy cooking. The limpets taught them dancing as well as they could for their lameness. The sea-birds taught them to make nests—a knowledge they have never needed to apply—and if the oysters did not teach them anything it was only because oysters are so very stupid, and not from any lack of friendly feeling.",be more nice meal sort thing get home possible happy nice meal have careful day go sea land creature kind attentive seal teach know ready play star fish teach astronomy jelly fish teach fancy cooking limpet teach dancing lameness sea bird teach make nest knowledge need apply oyster teach oyster stupid lack friendly feeling

100,"So they fetched their spades and dug—and there was no harm in that, as you very properly remark.",fetched spade dig be harm remark 
101,"But when the hole was finished, and the sea came creep, creep, creeping up—and at last a big wave thundered up the sand and swirled into the hole, Thomasina and Selim were struggling on the edge, fighting which should go in first, and the wave drew sandily back into the sea, and neither of them had bathed in the new bath. And now it was all wet and sandy, and its nice sharp edges rounded off, and much shallower. And as they looked at it angrily, the sandy bottom of the bath stirred and shifted and rose up, as if some great sea-beast were heaving underneath with his broad back. The wet sand slipped back in slabs at each side, and a long pointed thing like a thin cow’s back came slowly up. It showed broader and broader, and presently the flakes of wet sand were dropping heavily off the top of a brand-new bathing machine that stood on the sand over where their bath had been.",hole finish sea come creep creep creep last big wave thunder sand swirl hole struggle edge fighting go wave draw sea bath new bath wet sandy nice sharp edge round shallower look sandy bottom bath stirr shift rise great sea beast heave broad back wet sand slip slab side long point thing thin cow come show broad broad flake wet sand drop top brand new bathing machine stand sand bath

103,"They certainly had, for on the door of the bathing machine was painted: “You must not bathe any more except through me.”",have door bathing machine paint bathe

105,"After this the children did not seem to care so much about the seaside, and they played more on the downs, where the rabbits were very kind and hospitable, and in the woods, where all sorts of beautiful flowers grew wild—and there was nobody to say “Don’t” when you picked them. The children thought of what Uncle Thomas would have said if he had been there, and they were very, very happy.",child seem care much seaside play more down rabbit kind hospitable wood sort beautiful flower grow wild be say pick child think say happy 
106,But one day Thomasina had pulled a lot of white convolvulus and some pink geraniums and calceolarias—the kind you are never allowed to pick at home—and she had made a wreath of them and put it on her head.,day pull lot white convolvulus pink geranium calceolarias kind allow pick home make wreath put head

109,"And she had. A large stiff hat that hurt her head just where the elastic was sewn on, and she had her stiff white frock that scratched, her tiresome underclothing, all of it, and stockings and heavy boots; and Selim had his sailor suit—the every-day one that was too tight in the arms; and they had to wear them always, and their fur coats were taken away.",have large stiff hat hurt head elastic sew have stiff white frock scratch tiresome underclothing stocking heavy boot have sailor suit day one tight arm have wear fur coat take 
110,"They went sadly, all stiff and uncomfortable, and told the Bouncible Ball. It looked very grave, and great tears of salt water rolled down its red and green cheeks as it sat by the wet, seaweed-covered rock.",go stiff uncomfortable tell look grave great tear salt water roll red green cheek sit wet seaweed cover rock

112,"“Of course we can,” they said—and so they were—for a day and a half. And then it wasn’t exactly discontent but real naughtiness that brought them to grief.",course say day half discontent real naughtiness bring grief 
113,"They were playing on the downs by the edge of the wood under the heliotrope tree. A hedge of camellia bushes cast a pleasant shadow, and out in the open sunlight on the downs the orchids grew like daisies, and the carnations like buttercups. All about was that kind of turf on which the gardener does not like you to play, and they had pulled armfuls of lemon verbena and made a bed of it. But Selim’s blouse was tight under the arms. So when Thomasina said—",play down edge wood heliotrope tree hedge camellia bush cast pleasant shadow open sunlight down orchid grow daisy carnation buttercup kind turf gardener like play pull armful lemon verbena make bed blouse tight arm say 
114,"“Oh, Silly dear, how beautiful it is, just like fairyland,” he said—",silly dear beautiful fairyland say

119,"“There’s no such thing as fairyland, I tell you,” he grunted, “and I don’t believe in fairies.”",be such thing fairyland tell grunt believe fairy 
120,"And then, quite suddenly and very horribly the fairy turned into a policeman—because every one knows there are such things as policemen, and any one can believe in _them_.",fairy turn policeman one know be such thing policemen one believe 
121,"And all the rare and beautiful flowers withered up and disappeared, and only thorns and thistles were left, and the misty, twiny trim little grass path that led along the top of the cliffs turned into a parade, and the policeman walked up and down it incessantly, and watched the children at their play, and you know how difficult it is to play when any one is watching you, especially a policeman. Selim was extremely vexed: that was why, he said, there couldn’t possibly be glow-worms as big as bicycle lamps, which, of course, there were in “Whereyouwantogoto.” It was after that that the gas-lamps were put all along the parade, and a pier sprang up on purpose to be lighted with electricity, and a band played, because it is nonsense to have a pier without a band.",rare beautiful flower wither disappear thorn thistle leave misty twiny trim little grass path lead top cliff turn parade policeman walk watch child play know difficult play one watch policeman vexed say glow worm big bicycle lamp course be gas lamp put parade pier spring purpose light electricity band play nonsense have pier band

126,"And now I have something to tell you which you will find it hard to make any excuses for. I can’t make any myself. I can only ask you to remember how hard it is to be even moderately good, and how easy it is to be extremely naughty.",have tell find hard make excuse make ask remember hard good easy naughty 
127,"When the Bouncible Ball stopped bouncing, Selim said—",stop bounce say 
128,“I wonder what makes him bounce.”,wonder make bounce 
129,"“Oh no, _don’t!_” cried Thomasina, for she had heard her brother wonder that about balls before, and she knew all too well what it ended in.",cry hear brother wonder ball know end 
130,"“Oh, _don’t_,” she said, “oh, Silly, he brought us here, he’s been so kind.” But Selim said, “Nonsense; balls can’t feel, and it will be almost as good to play with after I’ve looked inside it.”",say bring kind say nonsense ball feel good play look 
131,"And then, before Thomasina could prevent him, he pulled out the knife Uncle Reggy gave him last holiday but one, and catching the Ball up, he plunged the knife into its side. The Bouncible Ball uttered one whiffing squeak of pain and grief, then with a low, hissing sigh its kindly spirit fled, and it lay, a lifeless mass of paint and india-rubber in the hands of its assassin. Thomasina burst into tears—but the heartless Selim tore open the Ball, and looked inside. You know well enough what he found there. Emptiness; the little square patch of india-rubber that makes the hard lump on the outside of the ball which you feel with your fingers when the ball is alive and his own happy, bouncing, cheerful self.",prevent pull knife give last holiday catching ball plunge knife side utter whiff squeak pain grief low hissing sigh kindly spirit flead lay lifeless mass paint india rubber hand assassin burst tear heartless tore open look know find emptiness little square patch india rubber make hard lump outside ball feel finger ball alive own happy bounce cheerful self

133,"“I—I almost wish I hadn’t,” said Selim at last; but before Thomasina could answer he had caught her hand.",wish say last answer catch hand 
134,"“Oh, look,” he cried, “look at the sea.”",look cry look sea 
135,"It was, indeed, a dreadful sight. The beautiful dancing, sparkling blue sea was drying up before their eyes—in less than a moment it was quite flat and dusty. It hurriedly laid down a couple of railway lines, ran up a signal-box and telegraph-poles, and became the railway at the back of their house at home.",dreadful sight beautiful dancing sparkling blue sea drying eye less moment flat dusty lay couple railway line run signal box telegraph pole become railway back house home 
136,"The children, gasping with horror, turned to the downs. From them tall, yellow brick houses were rising, as if drawn up by an invisible hand. Just as treacle does in cold weather if you put your five fingers in and pulled them up. But, of course, you are never allowed to do this. The beach got hard—it was a pavement. The green downs turned grey—they were slate roofs—and Thomasina and Selim found themselves at the iron gate of their own number in the terrace—and there was Uncle Thomas at the window knocking for them to come in, and Aunt Selina calling out to them how far from respectable it was to play in the streets.",child gasp horror turn down tall yellow brick house rise draw invisible hand treacle cold weather put finger pull course allow do beach get hard pavement green down turn grey slate roof find iron gate own number terrace be window knock come call respectable play street

138,"Selim and Thomasina have never seen “Whereyouwantogoto” again, nor the Bouncible Ball—not even his poor body—and they don’t deserve to either. Of course, Thomasina was not so much to blame as Selim, but she was punished just the same. I can’t help that. This is really the worst of being naughty. You not only have to suffer for it yourself, but some one else always has to suffer too, generally the person who loves you best.",see poor body deserve course much blame punish same help bad naughty have suffer one have suffer person love good 
139,"You are intelligent children, and I will not insult you with a moral. I am not Uncle Thomas. Nor will I ask you to remember what I have told you. I am not Aunt Selina.",intelligent child insult moral ask remember tell
