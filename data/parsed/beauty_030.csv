1,CHAPTER 30. A Thief,
2," My new master was an unmarried man. He lived at Bath, and was much engaged in business. His doctor advised him to take horse exercise, and for this purpose he bought me. He hired a stable a short distance from his lodgings, and engaged a man named Filcher as groom. My master knew very little about horses, but he treated me well, and I should have had a good and easy place but for circumstances of which he was ignorant. He ordered the best hay with plenty of oats, crushed beans, and bran, with vetches, or rye grass, as the man might think needful. I heard the master give the order, so I knew there was plenty of good food, and I thought I was well off.",new master unmarried man live engage business doctor advise take horse exercise purpose buy hire stable short distance lodging engage man name groom master know little horse treat have good easy place circumstance ignorant order good hay plenty oat crush bean bran vetche rye grass man think needful hear master give order know be plenty good food think 
3,"For a few days all went on well. I found that my groom understood his business. He kept the stable clean and airy, and he groomed me thoroughly; and was never otherwise than gentle. He had been an hostler in one of the great hotels in Bath. He had given that up, and now cultivated fruit and vegetables for the market, and his wife bred and fattened poultry and rabbits for sale. After awhile it seemed to me that my oats came very short; I had the beans, but bran was mixed with them instead of oats, of which there were very few; certainly not more than a quarter of what there should have been. In two or three weeks this began to tell upon my strength and spirits. The grass food, though very good, was not the thing to keep up my condition without corn. However, I could not complain, nor make known my wants. So it went on for about two months; and I wondered that my master did not see that something was the matter. However, one afternoon he rode out into the country to see a friend of his, a gentleman farmer, who lived on the road to Wells.",few day go find groom understand business keep stable clean airy groom gentle hostler great hotel give cultivate fruit vegetable market wife breed fatten poultry rabbit sale seem oat come short have bean bran mix oat be few more quarter week begin tell strength spirit grass food good thing keep condition corn complain make know want go month wonder master see matter afternoon ride country see friend gentleman farmer live road 
4,"This gentleman had a very quick eye for horses; and after he had welcomed his friend he said, casting his eye over me:",gentleman have quick eye horse welcome friend say cast eye 
5,"“It seems to me, Barry, that your horse does not look so well as he did when you first had him; has he been well?”",seem horse look have well 
6,"“Yes, I believe so,” said my master; “but he is not nearly so lively as he was; my groom tells me that horses are always dull and weak in the autumn, and that I must expect it.”",believe say master lively groom tell horse dull weak autumn expect 
7,"“Autumn, fiddlesticks!” said the farmer. “Why, this is only August; and with your light work and good food he ought not to go down like this, even if it was autumn. How do you feed him?”",autumn fiddlestick say farmer light work good food go autumn feed 
8,"My master told him. The other shook his head slowly, and began to feel me over.",master tell other shake head begin feel 
9,"“I can’t say who eats your corn, my dear fellow, but I am much mistaken if your horse gets it. Have you ridden very fast?”",say eat corn dear fellow mistaken horse get ride 
10,"“No, very gently.”",
11,"“Then just put your hand here,” said he, passing his hand over my neck and shoulder; “he is as warm and damp as a horse just come up from grass. I advise you to look into your stable a little more. I hate to be suspicious, and, thank heaven, I have no cause to be, for I can trust my men, present or absent; but there are mean scoundrels, wicked enough to rob a dumb beast of his food. You must look into it.” And turning to his man, who had come to take me, “Give this horse a right good feed of bruised oats, and don’t stint him.”",put hand say pass hand neck shoulder warm damp horse come grass advise look stable little more hate suspicious thank heaven have cause trust man present absent be mean scoundrel wicked rob dumb beast food look turn man come take give horse right good feed bruise oat stint 
12,"“Dumb beasts!” Yes, we are; but if I could have spoken I could have told my master where his oats went to. My groom used to come every morning about six o’clock, and with him a little boy, who always had a covered basket with him. He used to go with his father into the harness-room, where the corn was kept, and I could see them, when the door stood ajar, fill a little bag with oats out of the bin, and then he used to be off.",dumb beast speak tell master oat go groom use come morning o'clock little boy have cover basket use go father harness room corn keep see door stand ajar fill little bag oat bin use 
13,"Five or six mornings after this, just as the boy had left the stable, the door was pushed open, and a policeman walked in, holding the child tight by the arm; another policeman followed, and locked the door on the inside, saying, “Show me the place where your father keeps his rabbits’ food.”",morning boy leave stable door push open policeman walk hold child arm policeman follow lock door inside say show place father keep rabbit food 
14,"The boy looked very frightened and began to cry; but there was no escape, and he led the way to the corn-bin. Here the policeman found another empty bag like that which was found full of oats in the boy’s basket.",boy look frighten begin cry be escape lead way corn-bin policeman find empty bag find full oat boy basket 
15,"Filcher was cleaning my feet at the time, but they soon saw him, and though he blustered a good deal they walked him off to the “lock-up”, and his boy with him. I heard afterward that the boy was not held to be guilty, but the man was sentenced to prison for two months.",clean foot time see bluster good deal walk lock up boy hear boy hold guilty man sentence prison month
