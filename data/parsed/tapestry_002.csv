3," If it were cold just then in the thick-walled, well-warmed old house, which was Jeanne's home, you may fancy _how_ cold it was in the rumbling diligence, which in those days was the only way of travelling in France. And for a little boy whose experience of long journeys was small, this one was really rather trying. But Jeanne's cousin Hugh was a very patient little boy. His life, since his parents' death, had not been a _very_ happy one, and he had learnt to bear troubles without complaining. And now that he was on his way to the kind cousins his mother had so often told him of, the cousins who had been so kind to _her_, before she had any home of her own, his heart was so full of happiness that, even if the journey had been twice as cold and uncomfortable, he would not have thought himself to be pitied.",cold thick walled warm old house home fancy _how_ cold rumble diligence day only way travel little boy experience long journey small one try cousin patient little boy life parent death _very_ happy one learn bear trouble complain way kind cousin mother tell cousin kind have home own heart full happiness journey cold uncomfortable think pity 
4,"It was a pale little face, however, which looked out of the diligence window at the different places where it stopped, and a rather timid voice which asked in the pretty broken French he had not quite forgotten since the days that his mother taught him her own language, for a little milk for his ""pet."" The pet, which had travelled on his knees all the way from England--comfortably nestled up in hay and cotton wool in its cage, which looked something like a big mouse-trap--much better off in its way certainly than its poor little master. But it was a great comfort to him: the sight of its funny little nose poking out between the bars of its cage made Hugh feel ever so much less lonely, and when he had secured a little milk for his guinea-pig he did not seem to mind half so much about anything for himself.",pale little face look diligence window different place stop timid voice ask break forget day mother teach own language little milk pet pet travel knee way nestle hay cotton wool cage look big mouse trap good way poor little master great comfort sight funny little nose poke bar cage make feel lonely secure little milk guinea pig seem mind half much 
5,"Still it was a long and weary journey, and poor Hugh felt very glad when he was wakened up from the uncomfortable dose, which was all in the way of sleep he could manage, to be told that at last they had arrived. This was the town where his friends lived, and a ""monsieur,"" the conductor added, was inquiring for him--Jeanne's father's valet it was, who had been sent to meet him and take him safe to the old house, where an eager little heart was counting the minutes till he came.",long weary journey poor feel glad waken uncomfortable dose way sleep manage tell last arrive town friend live monsieur conductor add inquire father valet send meet take safe old house eager little heart count minute come 
6,"They looked at each other curiously when at last they met. Jeanne's eyes were sparkling and her cheeks burning, and her whole little person in a flutter of joyful excitement, and yet she couldn't speak. Now that the little cousin was there, actually standing before her, she could not speak. How was it? He was not _quite_ what she had expected; he looked paler and quieter than any boys she had seen, and--was he not glad to see her?--glad to have come?--she asked herself with a little misgiving. She looked at him again--his blue eyes were very sweet and gentle, and, tired though he was, Jeanne could see that he was trying to smile and look pleased. But he was _very_ tired and very shy. That was all that was the matter. And his shyness made Jeanne feel shy too.",look other last meet eye sparkling cheek burn whole little person flutter joyful excitement speak little cousin stand speak expect look paler quiet boy see glad see glad come ask little misgiving look blue eye sweet gentle tired see try smile look pleased tired shy matter shyness make feel shy

8,"""Not very, thank you,"" said Hugh. ""I am rather tired, but I am not very hungry,"" he added, glancing at a side-table where a little supper had been laid out for him. ""I am not very hungry, but I think Nibble is. Might I have a little milk for Nibble, please?""",thank say tired hungry add glance side table little supper lay hungry think nibble have little milk 
9,"As he spoke he held up for Jeanne to see the small box he was carrying, and she gave a little scream of pleasure when, through the bars, she caught sight of the guinea-pig's soft nose, poking out, saying as plainly almost as if he had spoken, ""I want my supper; please to see at once about my supper, little girl.""",speak hold see small box carry give little scream pleasure bar catch sight guinea pig soft nose poke say speak want supper see supper little girl 
10,"""Neeble,"" cried Jeanne, ""O my cousin, is Neeble your pet? Why, he is a 'cochon de Barbarie!' O the dear little fellow! We could not--at least papa and mamma could not--read what he was. And have you brought him all the way, my cousin, and do you love him very much?

11,"Once set free, her tongue ran on so fast that sometimes Hugh had difficulty to understand her. But the ice was broken any way, and when, an hour or two later, Jeanne's mother told her she might take Hugh up to show him his room, the two trotted off, hand-in-hand, as if they had been close companions for years.",set free tongue run have difficulty understand ice break way hour mother tell take show room trotet hand hand close companion year 
12,"""I hope you will like your room, chéri,"" said Jeanne, with a tiny tone of patronising. ""It is not very far from mine, and mamma says we can keep all our toys and books together in my big cupboard in the passage.""",hope like room say tiny tone patronise mamma say keep toy book big cupboard passage

14,Jeanne thought for a minute.,think minute 
15,"""'Mon cousin,' was it that?"" she said. ""Oh no, I remember, it was 'chéri.' I _cannot_ say your name--I have tried all these days. I cannot say it better than 'Ee-ou,' which is not pretty.""",cousin say remember say name try day say good pretty 
16,"She screwed her rosy little mouth into the funniest shape as she tried to manage ""Hugh."" Hugh could hardly help laughing.",screw rosy little mouth funny shape try manage help laugh 
17,"""Never mind,"" he said. ""I like 'chéri' ever so much better. I like it better than 'mon cousin' or any name, because, do you know,"" he added, dropping his voice a little, ""I remember now, though I had forgotten till you said it--that was the name mamma called me by.""",mind say like good like good cousin name know add drop voice little remember forget say name mamma call 
18,"""Chéri!"" repeated Jeanne, stopping half-way up the staircase to throw her arms round Hugh's neck at the greatest risk to the equilibrium of the whole party, including the guinea-pig--""_Chéri!_ I shall always call you so, then. You shall be my Prince Chéri. Don't you love fairy stories, mon cousin?""",repeat stop half way staircase throw arm neck great risk equilibrium whole party include guinea pig call love fairy story mon cousin

21,"""I knew you would,"" said Jeanne triumphantly. ""And oh, so do I! Marcelline says, Chéri, that the tapestry room--that's the room you're going to have--is full of fairy stories. I wonder if you'll find out any of them. You must tell me if you do.""",know say say tapestry room room go have full fairy story wonder find tell 
22,"""The tapestry room?"" repeated Hugh; ""I don't think I ever saw a tapestry room.

I mean all about William the Conqueror.""",tapestry room repeat think see tapestry room add sudden recollection strike queen work battle mean 
23,"""No,"" said Jeanne, ""it's quite different from that work. I've seen that, so I know. It isn't pretty at all. It's just long strips of linen with queer-shaped horses and things worked on. Not _at all_ pretty. And I think the pictures on the walls of your room _are_ pretty. Here it is. Isn't it a funny room, Chéri?""",say different work see know long strip linen queer shape horse thing work pretty think picture wall room pretty funny room 
24,"She opened the door of the tapestry room as she spoke, for while chattering they had mounted the staircase and made their way along the corridor. Hugh followed his little cousin into the room, and stood gazing round him with curious surprise and pleasure. The walls were well lighted up, for Marcelline had carried a lamp upstairs and set it down on the table, and a bright fire was burning in the wide old-fashioned hearth.",open door tapestry room speak chatter mount staircase make way corridor follow little cousin room stand gaze curious surprise pleasure wall light carry lamp set table bright fire burn wide old fashioned hearth 
25,"""Jeanne,"" said Hugh, after a minute's silence, ""Jeanne, it is very funny, but, do you know, I am _sure_ I have seen this room before. I seem to know the pictures on the walls.

27,"""Oh no, Chéri,"" she said. ""My room has a nice paper--roses and things like that running up and down. I am very glad my room is not like this.

32,"""I wish it was moonlight to-night,"" continued Hugh. ""I don't think I should go to sleep at all. I would lie awake watching all the pictures. I dare say they look rather nice in the firelight too, but still not _so_ nice as in the moonlight.""",wish moonlight night continue think go sleep lie watch picture say look nice firelight nice moonlight 
33,"""No, Monsieur,"" said Marcelline, who had followed the children into the room. ""A moonlight night is the time to see them best. It makes the colours look quite fresh again. Mademoiselle Jeanne has never looked at the tapestry properly by moonlight, or she would like it better.""",say follow child room moonlight night time see good make colour look fresh look tapestry moonlight like good 
34,"""I shouldn't mind with Chéri,"" said Jeanne. ""You must call me some night when it's very pretty, Chéri, and we'll look at it together.""",mind say call night pretty look 
35,"Marcelline smiled and seemed pleased, which was rather funny. Most nurses would have begun scolding Jeanne for dreaming of such a thing as running about the house in the middle of the night to admire the moonlight on tapestry or on anything else. But then Marcelline certainly was rather a funny person.",smile seem pleased funny most nurse begin scold dreaming thing run house middle night admire moonlight tapestry else funny person

41,"""Oh no,"" she said. ""He would be far better in the chickens' house. It's nice and warm, I know, and his cage can be in one corner. He wouldn't be nearly so lonely, and to-morrow I'll tell Houpet and the others that they must be very kind to him. Houpet always does what I tell him.""",say good chicken house nice warm know cage corner lonely tell other kind do tell

We can go through the tonnelle, and the chickens' house is close by.""",pet chicken reply pet course most pet live chicken house other little chicken add glance see leave room let run peep minute go tonnelle chicken house close 
44,"She darted off as she spoke, and Hugh, nothing loth, his precious Nibble still in his arms, followed her. They ran down the long corridor, on to which opened both the tapestry room and Jeanne's room at the other end, through a small sort of anteroom, and then--for though they were _upstairs_, the garden being built in terraces was at this part of the house on a level with the first floor--then straight out into what little Jeanne called ""the tonnelle.""",dart speak precious nibble arm follow run long corridor open tapestry room room other end small sort anteroom garden build terrace part house level first floor little call tonnelle

50,"There was no moonlight, but the light from the windows streamed out to where the children stood, and shone upon the beautiful icicles on the branches above their heads. For the tonnelle was a kind of arbour--a long covered passage made by trees at each side, whose boughs had been trained to meet and interlace overhead. And now, with their fairy tracery of snow and frost, the effect of the numberless little branches forming a sparkling roof was pretty and fanciful in the extreme. Jeanne looked up as she was told.",be moonlight light window stream child stand shine beautiful icicle branch head tonnelle kind arbour long cover passage make tree side bough train meet interlace fairy tracery snow frost effect numberless little branch form sparkling roof pretty fanciful extreme look tell

53,"""So it does,"" said Jeanne. ""What nice fancies you have, Chéri! But I wish you could see the tonnelle in summer. It _is_ pretty then, with all the leaves on. But we must run quick, or else Marcelline will be calling us before we have got to the chicken-house.""",say nice fancy have wish see tonnelle summer leave run call get chicken house 
54,"Off she set again, and Hugh after her, though not so fast, for Jeanne knew every step of the way, and poor Hugh had never been in the garden before. It was not very far to go, however--the chickens' house was in a little courtyard just a few steps from the tonnelle, and guided by Jeanne's voice in front as much as by the faint glimpses of her figure, dark against the snow, Hugh soon found himself safe beside her at the door of the chickens' house. Jeanne felt about till she got hold of the latch, which she lifted, and was going to push open the door and enter when Hugh stopped her.",set fast know step way poor garden go chicken house little courtyard few step tonnelle guide voice front faint glimpse figure dark snow find safe door chicken house feel get hold latch lift go push open door enter stop

56,"""Oh no,"" said Jeanne. ""It doesn't matter a bit that it's dark."" She opened the door as she spoke, and gently pulled Hugh in after her. ""Look,"" she went on, ""there is a very, very little light from the kitchen window after all, when the door is opened. Look, Chéri, up in that corner sleep Houpet and the others.

61,"A faint, a very faint little rustle was heard up above in the corner where Jeanne had tried to persuade her cousin that the chickens were to be _seen_, and delighted at this evidence that any way they were to be _heard_, she turned to him triumphantly.",faint faint little rustle hear corner try persuade cousin chicken _seen_ delight evidence way turn 
62,"""That's Houpet,"" she said. ""Dear little fellow, he's too sleepy to crow--he just gives a little wriggle to show that he's heard me.

For right before them on the path stood the old raven, on one leg as usual, though this it was too dark to see clearly. And, as Jeanne spoke, he gave a sharp, sudden croak, which made both the children jump, and then deliberately hopped away.",begin go low voice believe hear say angry path stand old raven leg usual dark see speak give sharp sudden croak make child jump hopp
