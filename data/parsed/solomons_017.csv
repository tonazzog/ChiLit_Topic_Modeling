1,CHAPTER XVI. THE PLACE OF DEATH,place death 
2,"It was already dark on the third day after the scene described in the previous chapter when we camped in some huts at the foot of the ""Three Witches,"" as the triangle of mountains is called to which Solomon's Great Road runs. Our party consisted of our three selves and Foulata, who waited on us--especially on Good--Infadoos, Gagool, who was borne along in a litter, inside which she could be heard muttering and cursing all day long, and a party of guards and attendants. The mountains, or rather the three peaks of the mountain, for the mass was evidently the result of a solitary upheaval, were, as I have said, in the form of a triangle, of which the base was towards us, one peak being on our right, one on our left, and one straight in front of us. Never shall I forget the sight afforded by those three towering peaks in the early sunlight of the following morning. High, high above us, up into the blue air, soared their twisted snow-wreaths. Beneath the snow-line the peaks were purple with heaths, and so were the wild moors that ran up the slopes towards them. Straight before us the white ribbon of Solomon's Great Road stretched away uphill to the foot of the centre peak, about five miles from us, and there stopped. It was its terminus.",dark third day scene describe previous chapter camp hut foot triangle mountain call great run party consist selve wait good borne litter hear mutter curse day party guard attendant mountain peak mountain mass result solitary upheaval say form triangle base peak right left front forget sight afford tower peak early sunlight follow morning high high blue air soar twist snow wreath snow line peak purple heath wild moor run slope white ribbon great stretch foot centre peak mile stop terminus 
3,"I had better leave the feelings of intense excitement with which we set out on our march that morning to the imagination of those who read this history. At last we were drawing near to the wonderful mines that had been the cause of the miserable death of the old Portuguese Dom three centuries ago, of my poor friend, his ill-starred descendant, and also, as we feared, of George Curtis, Sir Henry's brother. Were we destined, after all that we had gone through, to fare any better? Evil befell them, as that old fiend Gagool said; would it also befall us? Somehow, as we were marching up that last stretch of beautiful road, I could not help feeling a little superstitious about the matter, and so I think did Good and Sir Henry.",leave feeling intense excitement set march morning imagination read history last draw wonderful mine cause miserable death old portuguese century poor friend ill star descendant fear brother destine go fare good evil befell old fiend say befall march last stretch beautiful road help feel little superstitious matter think good 
4,"For an hour and a half or more we tramped on up the heather-fringed way, going so fast in our excitement that the bearers of Gagool's hammock could scarcely keep pace with us, and its occupant piped out to us to stop.",hour half more tramp heather fring way go excitement bearer hammock keep pace occupant pipe stop 
5,"""Walk more slowly, white men,"" she said, projecting her hideous shrivelled countenance between the grass curtains, and fixing her gleaming eyes upon us; ""why will ye run to meet the evil that shall befall you, ye seekers after treasure?"" and she laughed that horrible laugh which always sent a cold shiver down my back, and for a while quite took the enthusiasm out of us.",walk white man say project hideous shrivell countenance grass curtain fix gleam eye run meet evil befall seeker treasure laugh horrible laugh send cold shiver back while take enthusiasm 
6,"However, on we went, till we saw before us, and between ourselves and the peak, a vast circular hole with sloping sides, three hundred feet or more in depth, and quite half a mile round.",go see peak vast circular hole slope side foot more depth mile 
7,"""Can't you guess what this is?"" I said to Sir Henry and Good, who were staring in astonishment at the awful pit before us.",guess say stare astonishment awful pit 
8,They shook their heads.,shake head 
9,"""Then it is clear that you have never seen the diamond diggings at Kimberley. You may depend on it that this is Solomon's Diamond Mine. Look there,"" I said, pointing to the strata of stiff blue clay which were yet to be seen among the grass and bushes that clothed the sides of the pit, ""the formation is the same. I'll be bound that if we went down there we should find 'pipes' of soapy brecciated rock. Look, too,"" and I pointed to a series of worn flat slabs of stone that were placed on a gentle slope below the level of a watercourse which in some past age had been cut out of the solid rock; ""if those are not tables once used to wash the 'stuff,' I'm a Dutchman.""",clear see diamond digging depend my look say point strata stiff blue clay see grass bush cloth side pit formation same bind go find pipe soapy brecciate rock look point series wear flat slab stone place gentle slope level watercourse past age cut solid rock table use wash stuff 
10,"At the edge of this vast hole, which was none other than the pit marked on the old Dom's map, the Great Road branched into two and circumvented it. In many places, by the way, this surrounding road was built entirely out of blocks of stone, apparently with the object of supporting the edges of the pit and preventing falls of reef. Along this path we pressed, driven by curiosity to see what were the three towering objects which we could discern from the hither side of the great gulf. As we drew near we perceived that they were Colossi of some sort or another, and rightly conjectured that before us sat the three ""Silent Ones"" that are held in such awe by the Kukuana people. But it was not until we were quite close to them that we recognised the full majesty of these ""Silent Ones.""",edge vast hole other pit mark old map great branch circumvent many place way surround road build block stone object support edge pit prevent falls reef path press drive curiosity see tower object discern hither side great gulf draw perceive sort conjecture sit silent hold such awe person close recognise full majesty silent 
11,"There, upon huge pedestals of dark rock, sculptured with rude emblems of the Phallic worship, separated from each other by a distance of forty paces, and looking down the road which crossed some sixty miles of plain to Loo, were three colossal seated forms--two male and one female--each measuring about thirty feet from the crown of its head to the pedestal.",huge pedestal dark rock sculpture rude emblem phallic worship separate other distance pace look road cross mile plain colossal seat form male female measure foot crown head pedestal 
12,"The female form, which was nude, was of great though severe beauty, but unfortunately the features had been injured by centuries of exposure to the weather. Rising from either side of her head were the points of a crescent. The two male Colossi, on the contrary, were draped, and presented a terrifying cast of features, especially the one to our right, which had the face of a devil. That to our left was serene in countenance, but the calm upon it seemed dreadful. It was the calm of that inhuman cruelty, Sir Henry remarked, which the ancients attributed to beings potent for good, who could yet watch the sufferings of humanity, if not without rejoicing, at least without sorrow. These three statues form a most awe-inspiring trinity, as they sit there in their solitude, and gaze out across the plain for ever.",female form nude great severe beauty feature injure century exposure weather rise side head point crescent male contrary drape present terrifying cast feature one right have face devil left serene countenance calm seem dreadful calm inhuman cruelty remark ancient attribute being potent good watch suffering humanity rejoice least sorrow statue form awe inspire trinity sit solitude gaze plain 
13,"Contemplating these ""Silent Ones,"" as the Kukuanas call them, an intense curiosity again seized us to know whose were the hands which had shaped them, who it was that had dug the pit and made the road. Whilst I was gazing and wondering, suddenly it occurred to me--being familiar with the Old Testament--that Solomon went astray after strange gods, the names of three of whom I remembered--""Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the children of Ammon""--and I suggested to my companions that the figures before us might represent these false and exploded divinities.",contemplate silent call intense curiosity seize know hand shape dig pit make road gaze wonder occur familiar old go astray strange god name remember goddess god god child suggest companion figure represent false explode divinity 
14,"""Hum,"" said Sir Henry, who is a scholar, having taken a high degree in classics at college, ""there may be something in that; Ashtoreth of the Hebrews was the Astarte of the Phoenicians, who were the great traders of Solomon's time. Astarte, who afterwards became the Aphrodite of the Greeks, was represented with horns like the half-moon, and there on the brow of the female figure are distinct horns. Perhaps these Colossi were designed by some Phoenician official who managed the mines. Who can say?""[1]",say scholar take high degree classic college be great trader time become represent horn half moon brow female figure distinct horn design phoenician official manage mine say 
15,"Before we had finished examining these extraordinary relics of remote antiquity, Infadoos came up, and having saluted the ""Silent Ones"" by lifting his spear, asked us if we intended entering the ""Place of Death"" at once, or if we would wait till after we had taken food at mid-day. If we were ready to go at once, Gagool had announced her willingness to guide us. As it was not later than eleven o'clock--driven to it by a burning curiosity--we announced our intention of proceeding instantly, and I suggested that, in case we should be detained in the cave, we should take some food with us. Accordingly Gagool's litter was brought up, and that lady herself assisted out of it. Meanwhile Foulata, at my request, stored some ""biltong,"" or dried game-flesh, together with a couple of gourds of water, in a reed basket with a hinged cover. Straight in front of us, at a distance of some fifty paces from the backs of the Colossi, rose a sheer wall of rock, eighty feet or more in height, that gradually sloped upwards till it formed the base of the lofty snow-wreathed peak, which soared into the air three thousand feet above us. As soon as she was clear of her hammock, Gagool cast one evil grin upon us, and then, leaning on a stick, hobbled off towards the face of this wall. We followed her till we came to a narrow portal solidly arched that looked like the opening of a gallery of a mine.",finish examine extraordinary relic remote antiquity come salute silent lift spear ask intend enter wait take food mid-day ready go announce willingness guide o'clock drive burn curiosity announce intention proceed suggest case detain cave take food litter bring lady assist request store biltong dry game flesh couple gourd water reed basket hing cover front distance pace back rise sheer wall rock foot more height slope form base lofty snow wreathe peak soar air foot clear hammock cast evil grin lean stick hobble face wall follow come narrow portal arched look opening gallery

17,"""Now, white men from the Stars,"" she piped; ""great warriors, Incubu, Bougwan, and Macumazahn the wise, are ye ready? Behold, I am here to do the bidding of my lord the king, and to show you the store of bright stones. _Ha! ha! ha!_""",white man pipe great warrior wise ready do bid lord king show store bright stone

21,"""Nay, I come not; it is not for me to enter there. But thou, Gagool, curb thy tongue, and beware how thou dealest with my lords.

I have done the bidding of many kings, Infadoos, till in the end they did mine. _Ha! ha!_ I go to look upon their faces once more, and Twala's also!

28,"Without further ado Gagool plunged into the passage, which was wide enough to admit of two walking abreast, and quite dark. We followed the sound of her voice as she piped to us to come on, in some fear and trembling, which was not allayed by the flutter of a sudden rush of wings.",further ado plunge passage wide admit walking abreast dark follow sound voice pipe come fear tremble allay flutter sudden rush wing

32,"Let the reader picture to himself the hall of the vastest cathedral he ever stood in, windowless indeed, but dimly lighted from above, presumably by shafts connected with the outer air and driven in the roof, which arched away a hundred feet above our heads, and he will get some idea of the size of the enormous cave in which we found ourselves, with the difference that this cathedral designed by nature was loftier and wider than any built by man. But its stupendous size was the least of the wonders of the place, for running in rows adown its length were gigantic pillars of what looked like ice, but were, in reality, huge stalactites. It is impossible for me to convey any idea of the overpowering beauty and grandeur of these pillars of white spar, some of which were not less than twenty feet in diameter at the base, and sprang up in lofty and yet delicate beauty sheer to the distant roof. Others again were in process of formation. On the rock floor there was in these cases what looked, Sir Henry said, exactly like a broken column in an old Grecian temple, whilst high above, depending from the roof, the point of a huge icicle could be dimly seen.",let reader picture hall vastest cathedral stand windowless light shaft connect outer air drive roof arched foot head get idea size enormous cave find difference cathedral design nature lofty wide build man stupendous size least wonder place run row length gigantic pillar look ice reality huge stalactite impossible convey idea overpowering beauty grandeur pillar white spar less foot diameter base spring lofty delicate beauty sheer distant roof other process formation rock floor be case look say break column old grecian temple high depend roof point huge icicle see 
33,"Even as we gazed we could hear the process going on, for presently with a tiny splash a drop of water would fall from the far-off icicle on to the column below. On some columns the drops only fell once in two or three minutes, and in these cases it would be an interesting calculation to discover how long, at that rate of dripping, it would take to form a pillar, say eighty feet by ten in diameter. That the process, in at least one instance, was incalculably slow, the following example will suffice to show. Cut on one of these pillars we discovered the crude likeness of a mummy, by the head of which sat what appeared to be the figure of an Egyptian god, doubtless the handiwork of some old-world labourer in the mine. This work of art was executed at the natural height at which an idle fellow, be he Phoenician workman or British cad, is in the habit of trying to immortalise himself at the expense of nature's masterpieces, namely, about five feet from the ground. Yet at the time that we saw it, which _must_ have been nearly three thousand years after the date of the execution of the carving, the column was only eight feet high, and was still in process of formation, which gives a rate of growth of a foot to a thousand years, or an inch and a fraction to a century. This we knew because, as we were standing by it, we heard a drop of water fall.",gaze hear process go tiny splash drop water fall icicle column column drop fall minute case interesting calculation discover rate drip take form pillar say foot diameter process least instance slow follow example suffice show cut pillar discover crude likeness mummy head sit appear figure egyptian god handiwork old world labourer work art execute natural height idle fellow phoenician workman british cad habit try immortalise expense nature masterpiece foot ground time see year date execution carving column foot high process formation give rate growth foot year inch fraction century know stand hear drop water fall 
34,"Sometimes the stalagmites took strange forms, presumably where the dropping of the water had not always been on the same spot. Thus, one huge mass, which must have weighed a hundred tons or so, was in the shape of a pulpit, beautifully fretted over outside with a design that looked like lace. Others resembled strange beasts, and on the sides of the cave were fanlike ivory tracings, such as the frost leaves upon a pane.",stalagmite take strange form drop water same spot huge mass weigh ton shape pulpit fret design look lace other resemble strange beast side cave fanlike ivory tracing such frost leave pane 
35,"Out of the vast main aisle there opened here and there smaller caves, exactly, Sir Henry said, as chapels open out of great cathedrals. Some were large, but one or two--and this is a wonderful instance of how nature carries out her handiwork by the same unvarying laws, utterly irrespective of size--were tiny. One little nook, for instance, was no larger than an unusually big doll's house, and yet it might have been a model for the whole place, for the water dropped, tiny icicles hung, and spar columns were forming in just the same way.",vast main aisle open small cave say chapel open great cathedral large wonderful instance nature carry handiwork same unvarying law irrespective size tiny little nook instance large big doll house model whole place water drop tiny icicle hang spar column form same way 
36,"We had not, however, enough time to examine this beautiful cavern so thoroughly as we should have liked to do, since unfortunately, Gagool seemed to be indifferent as to stalactites, and only anxious to get her business over. This annoyed me the more, as I was particularly anxious to discover, if possible, by what system the light was admitted into the cave, and whether it was by the hand of man or by that of nature that this was done; also if the place had been used in any way in ancient times, as seemed probable. However, we consoled ourselves with the idea that we would investigate it thoroughly on our way back, and followed on at the heels of our uncanny guide.",enough time examine beautiful cavern like do seem indifferent stalactite anxious get business annoy more anxious discover possible system light admit cave hand man nature do place use way ancient time seem probable console idea investigate way follow heel uncanny guide

40,"""This is getting rather ghastly,"" said Sir Henry, peeping into the dark passageway. ""Come on, Quatermain--_seniores priores_.

43,"Thus adjured, I started down the passage, and after about twenty paces found myself in a gloomy apartment some forty feet long, by thirty broad, and thirty high, which in some past age evidently had been hollowed, by hand-labour, out of the mountain. This apartment was not nearly so well lighted as the vast stalactite ante-cave, and at the first glance all I could discern was a massive stone table running down its length, with a colossal white figure at its head, and life-sized white figures all round it. Next I discovered a brown thing, seated on the table in the centre, and in another moment my eyes grew accustomed to the light, and I saw what all these things were, and was tailing out of the place as hard as my legs could carry me.",adjure start passage pace find gloomy apartment foot broad high past age hollow hand labour mountain apartment light vast stalactite ante cave first glance discern massive stone table run length colossal white figure head life sized white figure discover brown thing seat table centre moment eye grow accustom light see thing tail place leg carry 
44,"I am not a nervous man in a general way, and very little troubled with superstitions, of which I have lived to see the folly; but I am free to own that this sight quite upset me, and had it not been that Sir Henry caught me by the collar and held me, I do honestly believe that in another five minutes I should have been outside the stalactite cave, and that a promise of all the diamonds in Kimberley would not have induced me to enter it again. But he held me tight, so I stopped because I could not help myself. Next second, however, _his_ eyes became accustomed to the light, and he let go of me, and began to mop the perspiration off his forehead. As for Good, he swore feebly, while Foulata threw her arms round his neck and shrieked.",nervous man general way little troubled superstition live see folly free own sight upset catch collar hold believe minute stalactite cave promise diamond induce enter hold tight stop help second _his_ eye become accustom light let go begin mop perspiration forehead swore throw arm neck shriek 
45,Only Gagool chuckled loud and long.,chuckle long 
46,"It _was_ a ghastly sight. There at the end of the long stone table, holding in his skeleton fingers a great white spear, sat _Death_ himself, shaped in the form of a colossal human skeleton, fifteen feet or more in height. High above his head he held the spear, as though in the act to strike; one bony hand rested on the stone table before him, in the position a man assumes on rising from his seat, whilst his frame was bent forward so that the vertebræ of the neck and the grinning, gleaming skull projected towards us, and fixed its hollow eye-places upon us, the jaws a little open, as though it were about to speak.",ghastly sight end long stone table hold skeleton finger great white spear sit shape form colossal human skeleton foot more height high head hold spear act strike bony hand rest stone table position man assume rise seat frame bend vertebræ neck grinn gleam skull project fix hollow eye place jaw little open about speak

48,"""And what are _those things_?"" asked Good, pointing to the white company round the table.",_those things_ ask good point white company table 
49,"""And what on earth is _that thing_?"" said Sir Henry, pointing to the brown creature seated on the table.",earth thing_ say point brown creature seat table

52,"Presently she stopped and pointed at the brown object seated on the table. Sir Henry looked, and started back with an exclamation; and no wonder, for there, quite naked, the head which Curtis' battle-axe had shorn from the body resting on its knees, was the gaunt corpse of Twala, the last king of the Kukuanas. Yes, there, the head perched upon the knees, it sat in all its ugliness, the vertebræ projecting a full inch above the level of the shrunken flesh of the neck, for all the world like a black double of Hamilton Tighe.[2] Over the surface of the corpse there was gathered a thin glassy film, that made its appearance yet more appalling, for which we were, at the moment, quite unable to account, till presently we observed that from the roof of the chamber the water fell steadily, _drip! drop! drip!_ on to the neck of the corpse, whence it ran down over the entire surface, and finally escaped into the rock through a tiny hole in the table. Then I guessed what the film was--_Twala's body was being transformed into a stalactite._",stop point brown object seat table look start exclamation wonder naked head battle axe shorn body rest knee gaunt corpse last king head perch knee sit ugliness vertebræ project full inch level shrunken flesh neck world black double surface corpse gather thin glassy film make appearance appalling moment unable account observe roof chamber water fall _drip drop drip!_ neck corpse run entire surface escape rock tiny hole table guess film body transform stalactite 
53,"A look at the white forms seated on the stone bench which ran round that ghastly board confirmed this view. They were human bodies indeed, or rather they had been human; now they were _stalactites_. This was the way in which the Kukuana people had from time immemorial preserved their royal dead. They petrified them. What the exact system might be, if there was any, beyond the placing of them for a long period of years under the drip, I never discovered, but there they sat, iced over and preserved for ever by the siliceous fluid.",look white form seat stone bench run ghastly board confirm view human body human way person have time immemorial preserve royal dead petrify exact system be place long period year drip discover sit ice preserve siliceous fluid 
54,"Anything more awe-inspiring than the spectacle of this long line of departed royalties (there were twenty-seven of them, the last being Ignosi's father), wrapped, each of them, in a shroud of ice-like spar, through which the features could be dimly discovered, and seated round that inhospitable board, with Death himself for a host, it is impossible to imagine. That the practice of thus preserving their kings must have been an ancient one is evident from the number, which, allowing for an average reign of fifteen years, supposing that every king who reigned was placed here--an improbable thing, as some are sure to have perished in battle far from home--would fix the date of its commencement at four and a quarter centuries back.",awe inspiring spectacle long line depart royalty be last father wrap shroud ice spar feature discover seat inhospitable board host impossible imagine practice preserve king ancient one evident number allow average reign year suppose king reign place improbable thing sure perish battle home fix date commencement quarter century 
55,"But the colossal Death, who sits at the head of the board, is far older than that, and, unless I am much mistaken, owes his origin to the same artist who designed the three Colossi. He is hewn out of a single stalactite, and, looked at as a work of art, is most admirably conceived and executed. Good, who understands such things, declared that, so far as he could see, the anatomical design of the skeleton is perfect down to the smallest bones.",colossal sit head board old mistaken owe origin same artist design hewn single stalactite look work art conceive execute good understand such thing declare see anatomical design skeleton perfect small bone 
56,"My own idea is, that this terrific object was a freak of fancy on the part of some old-world sculptor, and that its presence had suggested to the Kukuanas the idea of placing their royal dead under its awful presidency. Or perhaps it was set there to frighten away any marauders who might have designs upon the treasure chamber beyond. I cannot say. All I can do is to describe it as it is, and the reader must form his own conclusion.",own idea terrific object freak fancy part old world sculptor presence suggest idea place royal dead awful presidency set frighten marauder have design treasure chamber say do describe reader form own conclusion
