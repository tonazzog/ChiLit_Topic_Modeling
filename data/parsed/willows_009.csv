1,CHAPTER IX. WAYFARERS ALL,
2,"The Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly know why. To all appearance the summer’s pomp was still at fullest height, and although in the tilled acres green had given way to gold, though rowans were reddening, and the woods were dashed here and there with a tawny fierceness, yet light and warmth and colour were still present in undiminished measure, clean of any chilly premonitions of the passing year. But the constant chorus of the orchards and hedges had shrunk to a casual evensong from a few yet unwearied performers; the robin was beginning to assert himself once more; and there was a feeling in the air of change and departure. The cuckoo, of course, had long been silent; but many another feathered friend, for months a part of the familiar landscape and its small society, was missing too and it seemed that the ranks thinned steadily day by day. Rat, ever observant of all winged movement, saw that it was taking daily a southing tendency; and even as he lay in bed at night he thought he could make out, passing in the darkness overhead, the beat and quiver of impatient pinions, obedient to the peremptory call.",restless know appearance summer pomp full height till acre green give way gold rowan redden wood dash tawny fierceness light warmth colour present undiminished measure clean chilly premonition pass year constant chorus orchard hedge shrink casual evensong few unwearied performer robin begin assert more be feeling air change departure cuckoo course silent many feathered friend month part familiar landscape small society miss seem rank thin day day observant winged movement see take southing tendency lay bed night think make pass darkness overhead beat quiver impatient pinion obedient peremptory call 
3,"Nature’s Grand Hotel has its Season, like the others. As the guests one by one pack, pay, and depart, and the seats at the table-d’hote shrink pitifully at each succeeding meal; as suites of rooms are closed, carpets taken up, and waiters sent away; those boarders who are staying on, en pension, until the next year’s full re-opening, cannot help being somewhat affected by all these flittings and farewells, this eager discussion of plans, routes, and fresh quarters, this daily shrinkage in the stream of comradeship. One gets unsettled, depressed, and inclined to be querulous. Why this craving for change? Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly? You don’t know this hotel out of the season, and what fun we have among ourselves, we fellows who remain and see the whole interesting year out. All very true, no doubt the others always reply; we quite envy you--and some other year perhaps--but just now we have engagements--and there’s the bus at the door--our time is up! So they depart, with a smile and a nod, and we miss them, and feel resentful. The Rat was a self-sufficing sort of animal, rooted to the land, and, whoever went, he stayed; still, he could not help noticing what was in the air, and feeling some of its influence in his bones.",grand have season other guest pack pay depart seat table d’hote shrink succeed meal suite room close carpet take waiter send border stay pension next year full re-opening help affect flitting farewell eager discussion plan route fresh quarter daily shrinkage stream comradeship get unsettled depressed inclined querulous craving change stay jolly know hotel season fun have fellow remain see whole interesting year true doubt other reply envy other year have engagement be bus door time depart smile nod miss feel resentful self suffice sort animal root land go stay help notice air feel influence bone 
4,"It was difficult to settle down to anything seriously, with all this flitting going on. Leaving the water-side, where rushes stood thick and tall in a stream that was becoming sluggish and low, he wandered country-wards, crossed a field or two of pasturage already looking dusty and parched, and thrust into the great sea of wheat, yellow, wavy, and murmurous, full of quiet motion and small whisperings. Here he often loved to wander, through the forest of stiff strong stalks that carried their own golden sky away over his head--a sky that was always dancing, shimmering, softly talking; or swaying strongly to the passing wind and recovering itself with a toss and a merry laugh. Here, too, he had many small friends, a society complete in itself, leading full and busy lives, but always with a spare moment to gossip, and exchange news with a visitor. Today, however, though they were civil enough, the field-mice and harvest-mice seemed preoccupied. Many were digging and tunnelling busily; others, gathered together in small groups, examined plans and drawings of small flats, stated to be desirable and compact, and situated conveniently near the Stores. Some were hauling out dusty trunks and dress-baskets, others were already elbow-deep packing their belongings; while everywhere piles and bundles of wheat, oats, barley, beech-mast and nuts, lay about ready for transport.",difficult settle flitting go leave water side rushe stand thick tall stream become sluggish low wander country ward cross field pasturage look dusty parched thrust great sea wheat yellow wavy murmurous full quiet motion small whispering love wander forest stiff strong stalk carry own golden sky head sky dance shimmer talk sway pass wind recover toss merry laugh have many small friend society complete lead full busy life spare moment gossip exchange news visitor today civil field mouse harvest mouse seem preoccupy many digg tunnell other gather small group examine plan drawing small flat state desirable compact situate haul dusty trunk dress basket other elbow deep pack belonging pile bundle wheat oat barley beech mast nut lay ready transport

7,"‘O yes, we know that,’ explained a field-mouse rather shamefacedly; ‘but it’s always as well to be in good time, isn’t it? We really MUST get all the furniture and baggage and stores moved out of this before those horrid machines begin clicking round the fields; and then, you know, the best flats get picked up so quickly nowadays, and if you’re late you have to put up with ANYTHING; and they want such a lot of doing up, too, before they’re fit to move into.

That’s half the fun!’",mean reply first swallow make plan arrange thing talk know route take year stop fun

If you’ve GOT to leave this pleasant place, and your friends who will miss you, and your snug homes that you’ve just settled into, why, when the hour strikes I’ve no doubt you’ll go bravely, and face all the trouble and discomfort and change and newness, and make believe that you’re not very unhappy.

18,"‘No, you don’t understand, naturally,’ said the second swallow. ‘First, we feel it stirring within us, a sweet unrest; then back come the recollections one by one, like homing pigeons. They flutter through our dreams at night, they fly with us in our wheelings and circlings by day. We hunger to inquire of each other, to compare notes and assure ourselves that it was all really true, as one by one the scents and sounds and names of long-forgotten places come gradually back and beckon to us.’",understand say second swallow feel stir sweet unrest come recollection homing pigeon flutter dream night fly wheeling circling day hunger inquire other compare note assure true scent sound name long forget place come beckon

20,"‘I tried “stopping on” one year,’ said the third swallow. ‘I had grown so fond of the place that when the time came I hung back and let the others go on without me. For a few weeks it was all well enough, but afterwards, O the weary length of the nights! The shivering, sunless days! The air so clammy and chill, and not an insect in an acre of it! No, it was no good; my courage broke down, and one cold, stormy night I took wing, flying well inland on account of the strong easterly gales. It was snowing hard as I beat through the passes of the great mountains, and I had a stiff fight to win through; but never shall I forget the blissful feeling of the hot sun again on my back as I sped down to the lakes that lay so blue and placid below me, and the taste of my first fat insect! The past was like a bad dream; the future was all happy holiday as I moved southwards week by week, easily, lazily, lingering as long as I dared, but always heeding the call!

21,"‘Ah, yes, the call of the South, of the South!’ twittered the other two dreamily. ‘Its songs its hues, its radiant air! O, do you remember----’ and, forgetting the Rat, they slid into passionate reminiscence, while he listened fascinated, and his heart burned within him. In himself, too, he knew that it was vibrating at last, that chord hitherto dormant and unsuspected. The mere chatter of these southern-bound birds, their pale and second-hand reports, had yet power to awaken this wild new sensation and thrill him through and through with it; what would one moment of the real thing work in him--one passionate touch of the real southern sun, one waft of the authentic odor? With closed eyes he dared to dream a moment in full abandonment, and when he looked again the river seemed steely and chill, the green fields grey and lightless. Then his loyal heart seemed to cry out on his weaker self for its treachery.",call twitter other song hue radiant air remember forget slide passionate reminiscence listen fascinate heart burn know vibrate last chord dormant unsuspected mere chatter southern bound bird pale second hand report have power awake wild new sensation thrill moment real thing work passionate touch real southern sun waft authentic odor close eye dare dream moment full abandonment look river seem steely chill green field grey lightless loyal heart seem cry weak self treachery

23,"‘And do you think,’ said the first swallow, ‘that the other call is not for us too, in its due season?

27,"Restlessly the Rat wandered off once more, climbed the slope that rose gently from the north bank of the river, and lay looking out towards the great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards--his simple horizon hitherto, his Mountains of the Moon, his limit behind which lay nothing he had cared to see or to know. To-day, to him gazing South with a new-born need stirring in his heart, the clear sky over their long low outline seemed to pulsate with promise; to-day, the unseen was everything, the unknown the only real fact of life. On this side of the hills was now the real blank, on the other lay the crowded and coloured panorama that his inner eye was seeing so clearly. What seas lay beyond, green, leaping, and crested! What sun-bathed coasts, along which the white villas glittered against the olive woods! What quiet harbours, thronged with gallant shipping bound for purple islands of wine and spice, islands set low in languorous waters!",wander more climb slope rise north bank river lay look great ring barr vision simple horizon limit lay care see know day gaze new bear need stir heart clear sky long low outline seem pulsate promise day unseen unknown only real fact life side hill real blank other lay crowded coloured panorama inner eye see sea lay green leap crest sun bath coast white villa glitter olive wood quiet harbour throng gallant shipping bind purple island wine spice island set low languorous water 
28,"He rose and descended river-wards once more; then changed his mind and sought the side of the dusty lane. There, lying half-buried in the thick, cool under-hedge tangle that bordered it, he could muse on the metalled road and all the wondrous world that it led to; on all the wayfarers, too, that might have trodden it, and the fortunes and adventures they had gone to seek or found unseeking--out there, beyond--beyond!",rise descend river ward change mind seek side dusty lane lying half bury thick cool hedge tangle border muse metall road wondrous world lead wayfarer trodd fortune adventure go seek find unseeking 
29,"Footsteps fell on his ear, and the figure of one that walked somewhat wearily came into view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty one. The wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of courtesy that had something foreign about it--hesitated a moment--then with a pleasant smile turned from the track and sat down by his side in the cool herbage. He seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest unquestioned, understanding something of what was in his thoughts; knowing, too, the value all animals attach at times to mere silent companionship, when the weary muscles slacken and the mind marks time.",footstep fall ear figure walk come view see dusty one wayfarer reach salute gesture courtesy have foreign hesitate moment pleasant smile turn track sit side cool herbage seem tired let rest unquestion understand thought know value animal attach time mere silent companionship weary muscle slack mind mark time 
30,"The wayfarer was lean and keen-featured, and somewhat bowed at the shoulders; his paws were thin and long, his eyes much wrinkled at the corners, and he wore small gold ear rings in his neatly-set well-shaped ears. His knitted jersey was of a faded blue, his breeches, patched and stained, were based on a blue foundation, and his small belongings that he carried were tied up in a blue cotton handkerchief.",wayfarer lean keen feature bow shoulder paw thin long eye wrinkle corner wear small gold ear ring set shape ear knitted jersey fade blue breeche patch stain base blue foundation small belonging carry tie blue cotton handkerchief

There is a sound of distant reapers, and yonder rises a blue line of cottage smoke against the woodland. The river runs somewhere close by, for I hear the call of a moorhen, and I see by your build that you’re a freshwater mariner. Everything seems asleep, and yet going on all the time.

And because I’ve just tried it--six months of it--and know it’s the best, here am I, footsore and hungry, tramping away from it, tramping southward, following the old call, back to the old life, THE life which is mine and which will not let me go.’",say reply stranger doubt good try know try month know good footsore hungry tramp tramp follow old call old life life let go

36,"‘Nice little farm,’ replied the wayfarer, briefly. ‘Upalong in that direction’--he nodded northwards. ‘Never mind about it.

39,"‘Right,’ replied the stranger. ‘I’m a seafaring rat, I am, and the port I originally hail from is Constantinople, though I’m a sort of a foreigner there too, in a manner of speaking. You will have heard of Constantinople, friend? A fair city, and an ancient and glorious one. And you may have heard, too, of Sigurd, King of Norway, and how he sailed thither with sixty ships, and how he and his men rode up through streets all canopied in their honour with purple and gold; and how the Emperor and Empress came down and banqueted with him on board his ship. When Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and entered the Emperor’s body-guard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born, stayed behind too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor. Seafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my birth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the London River. I know them all, and they know me. Set me down on any of their quays or foreshores, and I am home again.’",right reply stranger seafare rat port hail sort foreigner manner speak hear friend fair city ancient glorious one hear sail ship man ride street canopy honour purple gold come banquet board ship return many remain enter emperor body guard ancestor bear stay ship give emperor seafarer wonder city birth home pleasant port know know set quay foreshore

41,"‘By no means,’ said the Sea Rat frankly. ‘Such a life as you describe would not suit me at all. I’m in the coasting trade, and rarely out of sight of land. It’s the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much as any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the riding-lights at night, the glamour!’",means say life describe suit coasting trade sight land jolly time shore appeal much seafaring southern seaport smell riding light night glamour 
42,"‘Well, perhaps you have chosen the better way,’ said the Water Rat, but rather doubtfully. ‘Tell me something of your coasting, then, if you have a mind to, and what sort of harvest an animal of spirit might hope to bring home from it to warm his latter days with gallant memories by the fireside; for my life, I confess to you, feels to me to-day somewhat narrow and circumscribed.’",choose good way say tell coasting have mind sort harvest animal spirit hope bring warm latter day gallant memory fireside life confess feel day narrow circumscribe 
43,"‘My last voyage,’ began the Sea Rat, ‘that landed me eventually in this country, bound with high hopes for my inland farm, will serve as a good example of any of them, and, indeed, as an epitome of my highly-coloured life. Family troubles, as usual, began it. The domestic storm-cone was hoisted, and I shipped myself on board a small trading vessel bound from Constantinople, by classic seas whose every wave throbs with a deathless memory, to the Grecian Islands and the Levant. Those were golden days and balmy nights! In and out of harbour all the time--old friends everywhere--sleeping in some cool temple or ruined cistern during the heat of the day--feasting and song after sundown, under great stars set in a velvet sky! Thence we turned and coasted up the Adriatic, its shores swimming in an atmosphere of amber, rose, and aquamarine; we lay in wide land-locked harbours, we roamed through ancient and noble cities, until at last one morning, as the sun rose royally behind us, we rode into Venice down a path of gold. O, Venice is a fine city, wherein a rat can wander at his ease and take his pleasure! Or, when weary of wandering, can sit at the edge of the Grand Canal at night, feasting with his friends, when the air is full of music and the sky full of stars, and the lights flash and shimmer on the polished steel prows of the swaying gondolas, packed so that you could walk across the canal on them from side to side! And then the food--do you like shellfish? Well, well, we won’t linger over that now.’",last voyage begin land country bound high hope inland farm serve good example epitome coloured life family trouble usual begin domestic storm cone hoist ship board small trading vessel bind classic sea wave throb deathless memory grecian golden day balmy night harbour time old friend sleep cool temple ruin cistern heat day feast song sundown great star set velvet sky turn coast shore swim atmosphere amber rose aquamarine lay wide land lock harbour roam ancient noble city last morning sun rise ride path gold fine city rat wander ease take pleasure weary wonder sit edge grand night feast friend air full music sky full star light flash shimmer polished steel prow sway gondola pack walk canal side side food like shellfish linger

45,"‘Southwards we sailed again at last,’ continued the Sea Rat, ‘coasting down the Italian shore, till finally we made Palermo, and there I quitted for a long, happy spell on shore. I never stick too long to one ship; one gets narrow-minded and prejudiced. Besides, Sicily is one of my happy hunting-grounds. I know everybody there, and their ways just suit me. I spent many jolly weeks in the island, staying with friends up country. When I grew restless again I took advantage of a ship that was trading to Sardinia and Corsica; and very glad I was to feel the fresh breeze and the sea-spray in my face once more.’",sail last continue coast italian shore make quit long happy spell shore stick ship get narrow minded prejudiced happy hunting grounds know way suit spend many jolly week island stay friend country grow restless take advantage ship trade glad feel fresh breeze sea spray face more

50,"‘From Corsica,’ he went on, ‘I made use of a ship that was taking wine to the mainland. We made Alassio in the evening, lay to, hauled up our wine-casks, and hove them overboard, tied one to the other by a long line. Then the crew took to the boats and rowed shorewards, singing as they went, and drawing after them the long bobbing procession of casks, like a mile of porpoises. On the sands they had horses waiting, which dragged the casks up the steep street of the little town with a fine rush and clatter and scramble. When the last cask was in, we went and refreshed and rested, and sat late into the night, drinking with our friends, and next morning I took to the great olive-woods for a spell and a rest. For now I had done with islands for the time, and ports and shipping were plentiful; so I led a lazy life among the peasants, lying and watching them work, or stretched high on the hillside with the blue Mediterranean far below me. And so at length, by easy stages, and partly on foot, partly by sea, to Marseilles, and the meeting of old shipmates, and the visiting of great ocean-bound vessels, and feasting once more.

51,"‘That reminds me,’ said the polite Water Rat; ‘you happened to mention that you were hungry, and I ought to have spoken earlier. Of course, you will stop and take your midday meal with me?

But couldn’t you fetch it along out here? I am none too fond of going under hatches, unless I’m obliged to; and then, while we eat, I could tell you more concerning my voyages and the pleasant life I lead--at least, it is very pleasant to me, and by your attention I judge it commends itself to you; whereas if we go indoors it is a hundred to one that I shall presently fall asleep.’",call kind brotherly say hungry sit happen mention shell fish pang extreme fetch fond go hatch oblige eat tell concern voyage pleasant life lead least pleasant attention judge commend go fall asleep 
53,"‘That is indeed an excellent suggestion,’ said the Water Rat, and hurried off home. There he got out the luncheon-basket and packed a simple meal, in which, remembering the stranger’s origin and preferences, he took care to include a yard of long French bread, a sausage out of which the garlic sang, some cheese which lay down and cried, and a long-necked straw-covered flask wherein lay bottled sunshine shed and garnered on far Southern slopes. Thus laden, he returned with all speed, and blushed for pleasure at the old seaman’s commendations of his taste and judgment, as together they unpacked the basket and laid out the contents on the grass by the roadside.",excellent suggestion say hurry get luncheon basket pack simple meal remember stranger origin preference take care include yard long french bread sausage garlic sing cheese lay cry long neck straw cover flask lay bottled sunshine shed garner southern slope laden return speed blush pleasure old seaman commendation taste judgment unpack basket lay content grass roadside 
54,"The Sea Rat, as soon as his hunger was somewhat assuaged, continued the history of his latest voyage, conducting his simple hearer from port to port of Spain, landing him at Lisbon, Oporto, and Bordeaux, introducing him to the pleasant harbours of Cornwall and Devon, and so up the Channel to that final quayside, where, landing after winds long contrary, storm-driven and weather-beaten, he had caught the first magical hints and heraldings of another Spring, and, fired by these, had sped on a long tramp inland, hungry for the experiment of life on some quiet farmstead, very far from the weary beating of any sea.",hunger assuage continue history late voyage conduct simple hearer port port land introduce pleasant harbour final quayside land wind contrary storm drive weather beat catch first magical hint heralding spring fire spe long tramp hungry experiment life quiet farmstead weary beating sea 
55,"Spell-bound and quivering with excitement, the Water Rat followed the Adventurer league by league, over stormy bays, through crowded roadsteads, across harbour bars on a racing tide, up winding rivers that hid their busy little towns round a sudden turn; and left him with a regretful sigh planted at his dull inland farm, about which he desired to hear nothing.",spell bind quiver excitement follow league stormy bay crowded roadstead harbour bar racing tide wind river hide busy little town sudden turn leave regretful sigh plant dull inland farm desire hear 
56,"By this time their meal was over, and the Seafarer, refreshed and strengthened, his voice more vibrant, his eye lit with a brightness that seemed caught from some far-away sea-beacon, filled his glass with the red and glowing vintage of the South, and, leaning towards the Water Rat, compelled his gaze and held him, body and soul, while he talked. Those eyes were of the changing foam-streaked grey-green of leaping Northern seas; in the glass shone a hot ruby that seemed the very heart of the South, beating for him who had courage to respond to its pulsation. The twin lights, the shifting grey and the steadfast red, mastered the Water Rat and held him bound, fascinated, powerless. The quiet world outside their rays receded far away and ceased to be. And the talk, the wonderful talk flowed on--or was it speech entirely, or did it pass at times into song--chanty of the sailors weighing the dripping anchor, sonorous hum of the shrouds in a tearing North-Easter, ballad of the fisherman hauling his nets at sundown against an apricot sky, chords of guitar and mandoline from gondola or caique? Did it change into the cry of the wind, plaintive at first, angrily shrill as it freshened, rising to a tearing whistle, sinking to a musical trickle of air from the leech of the bellying sail? All these sounds the spell-bound listener seemed to hear, and with them the hungry complaint of the gulls and the sea-mews, the soft thunder of the breaking wave, the cry of the protesting shingle. Back into speech again it passed, and with beating heart he was following the adventures of a dozen seaports, the fights, the escapes, the rallies, the comradeships, the gallant undertakings; or he searched islands for treasure, fished in still lagoons and dozed day-long on warm white sand. Of deep-sea fishings he heard tell, and mighty silver gatherings of the mile-long net; of sudden perils, noise of breakers on a moonless night, or the tall bows of the great liner taking shape overhead through the fog; of the merry home-coming, the headland rounded, the harbour lights opened out; the groups seen dimly on the quay, the cheery hail, the splash of the hawser; the trudge up the steep little street towards the comforting glow of red-curtained windows.",time meal refresh strengthen voice vibrant eye light brightness seem catch sea beacon fill glass red glow vintage lean compel gaze hold body soul talk eye change foam streak grey green leap northern sea glass shine hot ruby seem very heart beat have courage respond pulsation twin light shift grey steadfast red master hold bound fascinate powerless quiet world ray reced cease talk wonderful talk flow speech pass time song chanty sailor weigh drip anchor sonorous hum shroud tear ballad fisherman haul net sundown apricot sky chord guitar mandoline gondola caique change cry wind plaintive first shrill freshen rise tear whistle sink musical trickle air leech belly sail sound spell bound listener seem hear hungry complaint gull sea mew soft thunder breaking wave cry protest shingle speech pass beat heart follow adventure seaport fight escape rally comradeship gallant undertaking search island treasure fish lagoon doze day long warm white sand deep sea fishing hear tell mighty silver gathering mile long net sudden peril noise breaker moonless night tall bow great liner take shape fog merry home come headland round harbour light open group see quay cheery hail splash hawser trudge steep little street comforting glow red curtain window 
57,"Lastly, in his waking dream it seemed to him that the Adventurer had risen to his feet, but was still speaking, still holding him fast with his sea-grey eyes.",wake dream seem rise foot speak hold sea grey eye 
58,"‘And now,’ he was softly saying, ‘I take to the road again, holding on southwestwards for many a long and dusty day; till at last I reach the little grey sea town I know so well, that clings along one steep side of the harbour. There through dark doorways you look down flights of stone steps, overhung by great pink tufts of valerian and ending in a patch of sparkling blue water. The little boats that lie tethered to the rings and stanchions of the old sea-wall are gaily painted as those I clambered in and out of in my own childhood; the salmon leap on the flood tide, schools of mackerel flash and play past quay-sides and foreshores, and by the windows the great vessels glide, night and day, up to their moorings or forth to the open sea. There, sooner or later, the ships of all seafaring nations arrive; and there, at its destined hour, the ship of my choice will let go its anchor. I shall take my time, I shall tarry and bide, till at last the right one lies waiting for me, warped out into midstream, loaded low, her bowsprit pointing down harbour. I shall slip on board, by boat or along hawser; and then one morning I shall wake to the song and tramp of the sailors, the clink of the capstan, and the rattle of the anchor-chain coming merrily in. We shall break out the jib and the foresail, the white houses on the harbour side will glide slowly past us as she gathers steering-way, and the voyage will have begun! As she forges towards the headland she will clothe herself with canvas; and then, once outside, the sounding slap of great green seas as she heels to the wind, pointing South!",say take road hold many long dusty day last reach little grey sea town know cling steep side harbour dark doorway look flight stone step overh great pink tuft valerian end patch sparkling blue water little boat lie tether ring stanchion old sea wall paint clamber own childhood salmon leap flood tide school mackerel flash play quay side foreshore window great vessel glide night day mooring open sea ship seafaring nation arrive destined hour ship choice let go anchor take time tarry bide last right one lie wait warp midstream load low bowsprit point harbour slip board boat hawser morning wake song tramp sailor clink capstan rattle anchor chain come break jib foresail white house harbour side glide gather steering way voyage begin forge headland clothe canvas sound slap great green sea heel wind point 
59,"‘And you, you will come too, young brother; for the days pass, and never return, and the South still waits for you. Take the Adventure, heed the call, now ere the irrevocable moment passes! ’Tis but a banging of the door behind you, a blithesome step forward, and you are out of the old life and into the new! Then some day, some day long hence, jog home here if you will, when the cup has been drained and the play has been played, and sit down by your quiet river with a store of goodly memories for company. You can easily overtake me on the road, for you are young, and I am ageing and go softly. I will linger, and look back; and at last I will surely see you coming, eager and light-hearted, with all the South in your face!’",come young brother day pass return wait take adventure heed call irrevocable moment pass bang door blithesome step old life new day day jog cup drain play play sit quiet river store goodly memory company overtake road young age go linger look last see come eager light hearted face 
60,"The voice died away and ceased as an insect’s tiny trumpet dwindles swiftly into silence; and the Water Rat, paralysed and staring, saw at last but a distant speck on the white surface of the road.",voice die cease insect tiny trumpet dwindle silence paralyse stare see last distant speck white surface road 
61,"Mechanically he rose and proceeded to repack the luncheon-basket, carefully and without haste. Mechanically he returned home, gathered together a few small necessaries and special treasures he was fond of, and put them in a satchel; acting with slow deliberation, moving about the room like a sleep-walker; listening ever with parted lips. He swung the satchel over his shoulder, carefully selected a stout stick for his wayfaring, and with no haste, but with no hesitation at all, he stepped across the threshold just as the Mole appeared at the door.",rise proceed repack luncheon basket haste return gather few small necessary special treasure fond put satchel act slow deliberation move room sleep walker listen part lip swing satchel shoulder select stout stick wayfaring haste hesitation step threshold appear door 
62,"‘Why, where are you off to, Ratty?’ asked the Mole in great surprise, grasping him by the arm.",ask great surprise grasp arm 
63,"‘Going South, with the rest of them,’ murmured the Rat in a dreamy monotone, never looking at him. ‘Seawards first and then on shipboard, and so to the shores that are calling me!’",go rest murmure dreamy monotone look seaward first shipboard shore call 
64,"He pressed resolutely forward, still without haste, but with dogged fixity of purpose; but the Mole, now thoroughly alarmed, placed himself in front of him, and looking into his eyes saw that they were glazed and set and turned a streaked and shifting grey--not his friend’s eyes, but the eyes of some other animal! Grappling with him strongly he dragged him inside, threw him down, and held him.",press haste dogg fixity purpose alarm place front look eye see glaze set turn streak shift grey friend eye eye other animal grapple drag throw hold 
65,"The Rat struggled desperately for a few moments, and then his strength seemed suddenly to leave him, and he lay still and exhausted, with closed eyes, trembling. Presently the Mole assisted him to rise and placed him in a chair, where he sat collapsed and shrunken into himself, his body shaken by a violent shivering, passing in time into an hysterical fit of dry sobbing. Mole made the door fast, threw the satchel into a drawer and locked it, and sat down quietly on the table by his friend, waiting for the strange seizure to pass. Gradually the Rat sank into a troubled doze, broken by starts and confused murmurings of things strange and wild and foreign to the unenlightened Mole; and from that he passed into a deep slumber.",struggle few moment strength seem leave lay exhaust close eye tremble assist rise place chair collapse shrunk body shake violent shiver pass time hysterical fit dry sobbing make door throw satchel drawer lock sit table friend wait strange seizure pass sink troubled doze break start confuse murmuring thing strange wild foreign unenlightened pass deep slumber 
66,"Very anxious in mind, the Mole left him for a time and busied himself with household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the parlour and found the Rat where he had left him, wide awake indeed, but listless, silent, and dejected. He took one hasty glance at his eyes; found them, to his great gratification, clear and dark and brown again as before; and then sat down and tried to cheer him up and help him to relate what had happened to him.",anxious mind leave time busy household matter get dark return parlour find leave wide listless silent dejected take hasty glance eye find great gratification clear dark brown sit try cheer help relate happen 
67,"Poor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but how could he put into cold words what had mostly been suggestion? How recall, for another’s benefit, the haunting sea voices that had sung to him, how reproduce at second-hand the magic of the Seafarer’s hundred reminiscences? Even to himself, now the spell was broken and the glamour gone, he found it difficult to account for what had seemed, some hours ago, the inevitable and only thing. It is not surprising, then, that he failed to convey to the Mole any clear idea of what he had been through that day.",poor do good degree explain thing put cold word suggestion recall benefit haunting sea voice sung reproduce second hand magic reminiscence spell break glamour gone find difficult account seem hour inevitable only thing surprising fail convey clear idea day 
68,"To the Mole this much was plain: the fit, or attack, had passed away, and had left him sane again, though shaken and cast down by the reaction. But he seemed to have lost all interest for the time in the things that went to make up his daily life, as well as in all pleasant forecastings of the altered days and doings that the changing season was surely bringing.",much plain fit attack pass leave sane shake cast reaction seem lose interest time thing go make daily life pleasant forecasting alter day doing changing season bring 
69,"Casually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk to the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and their straining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising over bare acres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples around, of the browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling of cordials; till by easy stages such as these he reached midwinter, its hearty joys and its snug home life, and then he became simply lyrical.",seem indifference turn talk harvest gather tower wagon strain team grow rick large moon rise bare acre dot sheave talk reddening apple brown nut jam preserve distilling cordial easy stage such reach midwinter hearty joy snug home life become lyrical 
70,"By degrees the Rat began to sit up and to join in. His dull eye brightened, and he lost some of his listening air.",degree begin sit join dull eye brighten lose listening air 
71,"Presently the tactful Mole slipped away and returned with a pencil and a few half-sheets of paper, which he placed on the table at his friend’s elbow.",tactful slip return pencil few half sheet paper place table friend elbow 
72,"‘It’s quite a long time since you did any poetry,’ he remarked. ‘You might have a try at it this evening, instead of--well, brooding over things so much. I’ve an idea that you’ll feel a lot better when you’ve got something jotted down--if it’s only just the rhymes.’",long time do poetry remark have try evening brood thing have idea feel lot good get jott rhyme 
73,"The Rat pushed the paper away from him wearily, but the discreet Mole took occasion to leave the room, and when he peeped in again some time later, the Rat was absorbed and deaf to the world; alternately scribbling and sucking the top of his pencil. It is true that he sucked a good deal more than he scribbled; but it was joy to the Mole to know that the cure had at least begun.",push paper discreet take occasion leave room peep time absorb deaf world scribble suck top pencil true suck good deal scribble joy know cure least begin
