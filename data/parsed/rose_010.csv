2,"Little Betsinda came in to put Gruffanuff’s hair in papers; and the Countess was so pleased, that, for a wonder, she complimented Betsinda. ‘Betsinda!’ she said, ‘you dressed my hair very nicely today; I promised you a little present. Here are five sh--no, here is a pretty little ring, that I picked--that I have had some time.’ And she gave Betsinda the ring she had picked up in the court.

4,"‘No such thing,’ says Gruffanuff, ‘I have had it this ever so long. There, tuck me up quite comfortable; and now, as it’s a very cold night (the snow was beating in at the window), you may go and warm dear Prince Giglio’s bed, like a good girl, and then you may unrip my green silk, and then you can just do me up a little cap for the morning, and then you can mend that hole in my silk stocking, and then you can go to bed, Betsinda. Mind I shall want my cup of tea at five o’clock in the morning.’",such thing say have tuck comfortable cold night snow beat window go warm dear bed good girl unrip green silk do little cap morning mend hole silk stock go bed mind want cup tea o'clock morning

8,"Now, she was a very kind, merry, civil, pretty girl; but there must have been something very captivating about her this evening, for all the women in the servants’ hall began to scold and abuse her. The housekeeper said she was a pert, stuck-up thing: the upper-housemaid asked, how dare she wear such ringlets and ribbons, it was quite improper! The cook (for there was a woman-cook as well as a man-cook) said to the kitchen-maid that she never could see anything in that creetur: but as for the men, every one of them, Coachman, John, Buttons, the page, and Monsieur, the Prince of Crim Tartary’s valet, started up, and said--",kind merry civil pretty girl be captivating evening woman servant hall begin scold abuse housekeeper say pert stuck thing upper housemaid ask dare wear such ringlet ribbon improper cook be woman cook man -cook say kitchen maid see creetur man page valet start say

10,"‘Hands off; none of your impertinence, you vulgar, low people!’ says Betsinda, walking off with her pan of coals. She heard the young gentlemen playing at billiards as she went upstairs: first to Prince Giglio’s bed, which she warmed, and then to Prince Bulbo’s room.",hand impertinence vulgar low person say walk pan coal hear young gentleman play billiards go first bed warm room 
11,"He came in just as she had done; and as soon as he saw her, ‘O! O! O! O! O! O! what a beyou--oo--ootiful creature you are! You angel--you peri--you rosebud, let me be thy bulbul--thy Bulbo, too! Fly to the desert, fly with me! I never saw a young gazelle to glad me with its dark blue eye that had eyes like shine. Thou nymph of beauty, take, take this young heart. A truer never did itself sustain within a soldier’s waistcoat. Be mine! Be mine! Be Princess of Crim Tartary! My Royal father will approve our union; and, as for that little carroty-haired Angelica, I do not care a fig for her any more.’",come do see beyou ootiful creature angel peri rosebud let bulbul fly desert fly see young gazelle glad dark blue eye have eye shine nymph beauty take take young heart truer sustain soldier waistcoat royal father approve union little carroty haired care fig more

15,"Prince Bulbo made such a noise that Prince Giglio, who heard him from the next room, came in to see what was the matter. As soon as he saw what was taking place, Giglio, in a fury, rushed on Bulbo, kicked him in the rudest manner up to the ceiling, and went on kicking him till his hair was quite out of curl.",make noise hear next room come see matter see take place fury rush kick rude manner ceiling go kick hair curl 
16,"Poor Betsinda did not know whether to laugh or to cry; the kicking certainly must hurt the Prince, but then he looked so droll! When Giglio had done knocking him up and down to the ground, and whilst he went into a corner rubbing himself, what do you think Giglio does? He goes down on his own knees to Betsinda, takes her hand, begs her to accept his heart, and offers to marry her that moment. Fancy Betsinda’s condition, who had been in love with the Prince ever since she first saw him in the palace garden, when she was quite a little child.",poor know laugh cry kick hurt look droll do knock ground go corner rub think go own knee take hand beg accept heart offer marry moment fancy condition love see palace garden little child 
17,"‘Oh, divine Betsinda!’ says the Prince, ‘how have I lived fifteen years in thy company without seeing thy perfections? What woman in all Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, nay, in Australia, only it is not yet discovered, can presume to be thy equal? Angelica? Pish! Gruffanuff? Phoo! The Queen? Ha, ha! Thou art my Queen. Thou art the real Angelica, because thou art really angelic.’",divine say live year company see perfection woman discover presume equal art art real angelic 
18,"‘Oh, Prince! I am but a poor chambermaid,’ says Betsinda, looking, however, very much pleased.",poor chambermaid say look pleased

21,"When poor Prince Bulbo, who was now madly in love with Betsinda, heard this declaration, when he saw the unmistakable glances which she flung upon Giglio, Bulbo began to cry bitterly, and tore quantities of hair out of his head, till it all covered the room like so much tow.",poor love hear declaration see unmistakable glance flung begin cry tore quantity hair head cover room much tow 
22,"Betsinda had left the warming-pan on the floor while the princes were going on with their conversation, and as they began now to quarrel and be very fierce with one another, she thought proper to run away.",leave warming pan floor prince go conversation begin quarrel fierce think proper run

34,"‘We’ll meet again,’ says Giglio, shaking his fist in Bulbo’s face; and seizing up the warming-pan, he kissed it, because, forsooth, Betsinda had carried it, and rushed downstairs. What should he see on the landing but His Majesty talking to Betsinda, whom he called by all sorts of fond names. His Majesty had heard a row in the building, so he stated, and smelling something burning, had come out to see what the matter was.",meet say shake fist face seize warming pan kiss carry rush see landing talk call sort fond name hear row building state smell burn come see matter

37,"‘Oh, sir! what will Her Majesty say?’ cries Betsinda.",sir say cry 
38,"‘Her Majesty!’ laughs the monarch. ‘Her Majesty be hanged. Am I not Autocrat of Paflagonia? Have I not blocks, ropes, axes, hangmen--ha? Runs not a river by my palace wall? Have I not sacks to sew up wives withal? Say but the word, that thou wilt be mine own,--your mistress straightway in a sack is sewn, and thou the sharer of my heart and throne.’",laugh monarch hang block rope axe hangmen run river palace wall sack sew wife say word own mistress straightway sack sew sharer heart throne 
39,"When Giglio heard these atrocious sentiments, he forgot the respect usually paid to Royalty, lifted up the warming-pan, and knocked down the King as flat as a pancake; after which, Master Giglio took to his heels and ran away, and Betsinda went off screaming, and the Queen, Gruffanuff, and the Princess, all came out of their rooms. Fancy their feelings on beholding their husband, father, sovereign, in this posture!",hear atrocious sentiment forget respect pay lift warming pan knock flat pancake take heel run go scream come room fancy feeling behold husband father sovereign posture
