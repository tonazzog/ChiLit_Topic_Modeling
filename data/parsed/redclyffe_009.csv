3," How was it meantime with Laura? The others were laughing and talking round her, but all seemed lost in the transcendent beam that had shone out on her. To be told by Philip that she was all to him that he had always been to her! This one idea pervaded her--too glorious, too happy for utterance, almost for distinct thought. The softening of his voice, and the look with which he had regarded her, recurred again and again, startling her with a sudden surprise of joy almost as at the first moment. Of the future Laura thought not. Never had a promise of love been made with less knowledge of what it amounted to: it seemed merely an expression of sentiments that she had never been without; for had she not always looked up to Philip more than any other living creature, and gloried in being his favourite cousin? Ever since the time when he explained to her the plates in the Encyclopaedia, and made her read ‘Joyce’s Scientific Dialogues,’ when Amy took fright at the first page. That this might lead further did not occur to her; she was eighteen, she had no experience, not even in novels, she did not know what she had done; and above all, she had so leant to surrender her opinions to Philip, and to believe him always right, that she would never have dreamt of questioning wherever he might choose to lead her. Even the caution of secrecy did not alarm her, though she wondered that he thought it required, safe as his confidence always was with her. Mrs. Edmonstone had been so much occupied by Charles’s illness, as to have been unable to attend to her daughters in their girlish days; and in the governess’s time the habit had been disused of flying at once to her with every joy or grief. Laura’s thoughts were not easy of access, and Philip had long been all in all to her. She was too ignorant of life to perceive that it was her duty to make this conversation known; or, more truly, she did not awaken her mind to consider that anything could be wrong that Philip desired.",meantime other laugh talk seem lose transcendent beam shine tell idea pervade glorious happy utterance distinct thought softening voice look regard recurr startling sudden surprise joy first moment future think have promise love make less knowledge amount seem expression sentiment look more other living creature glory favourite cousin time explain plate make read scientific take fright first page lead occur have experience novel know do lean surrender opinion believe right dreamt question choose lead caution secrecy alarm wonder think require safe confidence occupy illness unable attend daughter girlish day governess time habit disuse fly joy grief thought easy access ignorant life perceive duty make conversation know awake mind consider wrong desire

18,"Nothing could be more reassuring than Guy’s demeanour. His head seemed entirely full of the Thursday, and of a plan of his own for enabling Charles to go to the review. It had darted into his head while he was going over the ground with Maurice. It was so long since Charles had thought it possible to attempt any amusement away from home, and former experiments had been so unsuccessful, that it had never even occurred to him to think of it; but he caught at the idea with great delight and eagerness. Mrs. Edmonstone seemed not to know what to say; she had much rather that it had not been proposed; yet it was very kind of Guy, and Charles was so anxious about it that she knew not how to oppose him.",reassuring guy demeanour head seem full plan own enable go review dart head go ground long think possible attempt amusement home former experiment unsuccessful occur think catch idea great delight eagerness seem know say have much propose kind anxious know oppose 
19,"She could not bear to have Charles in a crowd, helpless as he was; and she had an unpleasing remembrance of the last occasion when they had taken him to a flower-show, where they had lost, first Mr. Edmonstone, next the carriage, and lastly, Amy and Charlotte--all had been frightened, and Charles laid up for three days from the fatigue.",bear have crowd helpless have unpleasing remembrance last occasion take flower show lose first carriage frighten lay day fatigue 
20,"Answers, however, met each objection. Charles was much stronger; Guy’s arm would be ready for him; Guy would find the carriage.

32,"Mrs. Edmonstone was not happy, but she had great confidence in Guy; and her only real scruple was, that she did not think it fair to occupy him entirely with attendance on her son. She referred it to papa, which, as every one knew, was the same as yielding the point, and consoled herself by the certainty that to prevent it would be a great disappointment to both the youths. Laura was convinced that to achieve the adventure of Charles at the review, was at present at least a matter of far more prominence with Guy than anything relating to herself.",happy have great confidence only real scruple think fair occupy attendance son refer papa one know same yield point console certainty prevent great disappointment youth convince achieve adventure review present least matter more prominence guy relate 
33,"All but Laura and her mother were wild about the weather, especially on Wednesday, when there was an attempt at a thunder storm. Nothing was studied but the sky; and the conversation consisted of prognostications, reports of rises and falls of the glass, of the way weather-cocks were turning, or about to turn, of swallows flying high or low, red sunsets, and halos round the moon, until at last Guy, bursting into a merry laugh, begged Mrs. Edmonstone’s pardon for being such a nuisance, and made a vow, and kept it, that be the weather what it might, he would say not another word about it that evening; it deserved to be neglected, for he had not been able to settle to anything all day.",mother wild weather be attempt thunder storm study sky conversation consist prognostication report rise falls glass way weather cock turn turn swallow fly high low red sunset halo moon last guy burst merry laugh begg pardon nuisance make vow keep weather say word evening deserve neglect able settle day 
34,"He might have said for many days before; for since the last ball, and still more since Lady Eveleen had been at Hollywell, it had been one round of merriment and amusement. Scrambling walks, tea-drinkings out of doors, dances among themselves, or with the addition of the Harpers, were the order of the day. Amy, Eveleen, and Guy, could hardly come into the room without dancing, and the piano was said to acknowledge nothing but waltzes, polkas, and now and then an Irish jig, for the special benefit of Mr. Edmonstone’s ears. The morning was almost as much spent in mirth as the afternoon, for the dawdlings after breakfast, and before luncheon, had a great tendency to spread out and meet, there was new music and singing to be practised, or preparations made for evening’s diversion, or councils to be held, which Laura’s absence could not break up, though it often made Amy feel how much less idle and frivolous Laura was than herself. Eveleen said the same, but she was visiting, and it was a time to be idle; and Mr. Lascelles seemed to be of the same opinion with regard to his pupil; for, when Guy was vexed at not having done as much work as usual, he only laughed at him for expecting to be able to go to balls, and spend a summer of gaiety, while he studied as much as at Oxford.",say many day last ball more round merriment amusement scramble walk tea drinking door dance addition order day come room dancing piano say acknowledge waltze polka irish jig special benefit ear morning much spend mirth afternoon dawdling breakfast luncheon have great tendency spread meet be new music singing practise preparation make evening diversion council hold absence break make feel idle frivolous say same visit time idle seem same opinion regard pupil guy vex do much work usual laugh expect able go ball spend summer gaiety study much 
35,"Thursday morning was all that heart could wish, the air cooled by the thunder, and the clouds looking as if raining was foreign to their nature. Mr. and Mrs. Edmonstone, their daughters, and Lady Eveleen, were packed inside and outside the great carriage, while Guy, carefully settling Charles in the low phaeton, putting in all that any one recommended, from an air-cushion to an umbrella, flourished his whip, and drove off with an air of exultation and delight.",morning heart wish air cool thunder cloud look rain foreign nature daughter pack great carriage settle low phaeton put one recommend air cushion umbrella flourish whip drive air exultation delight 
36,"Everything went off to admiration. No one was more amused than Charles. The scene was so perfectly new and delightful to one accustomed to such a monotonous life, that the very sight of people was a novelty. Nowhere was there so much laughing and talking as in that little carriage, and whenever Mrs. Edmonstone’s anxious eye fell upon it, she always saw Charles sitting upright, with a face so full of eager interest as to banish all thought of fatigue. Happy, indeed, he was. He enjoyed the surprise of his acquaintance at meeting him; he enjoyed Dr. Mayerne’s laugh and congratulation; he enjoyed seeing how foolish Philip thought him, nodding to his mother and sisters, laughing at the dreadful faces Guy could not help making at any particularly discordant note of the offensive bugle; and his capabilities rising with his spirits, he did all that the others did, walked further than he had done for years, was lifted up steps without knowing how, sat out the whole breakfast, talked to all the world, and well earned the being thoroughly tired, as he certainly was when Guy put him into the carriage and drove him home, and still more so when Guy all but carried him up stairs, and laid him on the sofa in the dressing-room.",go admiration amused scene new delightful accustom monotonous life very sight person novelty be much laugh talk little carriage anxious eye fall see sit face full eager interest banish thought fatigue happy enjoy surprise acquaintance meet enjoy laugh congratulation enjoy see foolish think nodd mother sister laugh dreadful face guy help make discordant note offensive bugle capability rise spirit do other walk do year lift step know sit whole breakfast talk world earn tired put carriage drive guy carry stair lay sofa dress room

143,"All the remainder of the evening Philip was occupied with attentions to the rest of the world, but Laura’s eyes followed him everywhere, and though she neither expected nor desired him to bestow more time on her, she underwent a strange restlessness and impatience of feeling. Her numerous partners teased her by hindering her from watching him moving about the room, catching his tones, and guessing what he was talking of;--not that she wanted to meet his eye, for she did not like to blush, nor did she think it pleased him to see her do so, for he either looked away immediately or conveyed a glance which she understood as monitory. She kept better note of his countenance than of her own partner’s.",remainder evening occupy attention rest world eye follow expect desire bestow more time underwent strange restlessness impatience feeling numerous partner tease hinder watch move room catching tone guess talk want meet eye like blush think pleased see do look convey glance understand monitory keep good note countenance own partner 
144,"Mr. Thorndale, meanwhile, kept aloof from Lady Eveleen de Courcy, but Captain Morville perceived that his eyes were often turned towards her, and well knew it was principle, and not inclination, that held him at a distance. He did indeed once ask her to dance, but she was engaged, and he did not ask her to reserve a future dance for him, but contented himself with little Amy.",keep aloof perceive eye turn know principle inclination hold distance ask dance engage ask reserve future dance content little 
145,"Amy was doing her best to enjoy herself, because she thought it ungrateful not to receive pleasure from those who wished to give it, but to her it wanted the zest and animation of Lady Kilcoran’s ball. Besides, she knew she had been as idle as Guy, or still more so, and she thought it wrong she should have pleasure while he was doing penance. It was on her mind, and damped her spirits, and though she smiled, and talked, and admired, and danced lightly and gaily, there was a sensation of weariness throughout, and no one but Eveleen was sorry when Mrs. Edmonstone sent Maurice to see for the carriage.",do good enjoy think ungrateful receive pleasure wish give want zest animation ball know idle think wrong have pleasure do penance mind damp spirit smile talk admire dance be sensation weariness sorry send see carriage

147,"Laura, though blushing and shrinking the moment before was braced by his words and tone to attempt all he wished. She looked up in what she meant to be an indifferent manner, and made some observation in a careless tone--anything rather than let Philip think her silly. After what he had said, was she not bound more than ever to exert herself to the utmost, that he might not be disappointed in her? She loved him only the better for what others might have deemed a stern coldness of manner, for it made the contrast of his real warmth of affection more precious. She mused over it, as much as her companions’ conversation would allow, on the road home. They arrived, Mrs. Edmonstone peeped into Charles’s room, announced that he was quietly asleep, and they all bade each other good night, or good morning, and parted.",blush shrink moment brace word tone attempt wish look mean indifferent manner make observation careless tone let think silly say bind more exert utmost disappoint love good other deem stern coldness manner make contrast real warmth affection precious muse much companion conversation allow road home arrive peep room announce asleep bid other good night good morning part
