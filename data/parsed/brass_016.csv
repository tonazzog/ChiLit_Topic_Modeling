1,CHAPTER XVI. A KILLING FROST,
2," Fortunately for Ventimore, the momentary dismay he had felt on finding himself deserted by his unfathomable Jinnee at the very outset of the ceremony passed unnoticed, as the Prime Warden of the Candlestick-makers' Company immediately came to his rescue by briefly introducing him to the Lord Mayor, who, with dignified courtesy, had descended to the lowest step of the dais to receive him.",momentary dismay feel find desert unfathomable very outset ceremony pass prime maker come rescue introduce dignified courtesy descend low step dais receive 
3,"""Mr. Ventimore,"" said the Chief Magistrate, cordially, as he pressed Horace's hand, ""you must allow me to say that I consider this one of the greatest privileges--if not _the_ greatest privilege--that have fallen to my lot during a term of office in which I have had the honour of welcoming more than the usual number of illustrious visitors.""",say chief press hand allow say consider great privilege great privilege fall lot term office have honour welcoming more usual number illustrious visitor 
4,"""My Lord Mayor,"" said Horace, with absolute sincerity, ""you really overwhelm me. I--I only wish I could feel that I had done anything to deserve this--this magnificent compliment!""",say absolute sincerity overwhelm wish feel do deserve magnificent compliment 
5,"""Ah!"" replied the Lord Mayor, in a paternally rallying tone. ""Modest, my dear sir, I perceive. Like all truly great men! A most admirable trait! Permit me to present you to the Sheriffs.""",reply rallying tone modest dear sir perceive great man admirable trait permit present 
6,"The Sheriffs appeared highly delighted. Horace shook hands with both of them; indeed, in the flurry of the moment he very nearly offered to do so with the Sword and Mace bearers as well, but their hands were, as it happened, otherwise engaged.",appear delighted shake hand flurry moment offer do bearer hand happen engage 
7,"""The actual presentation,"" said the Lord Mayor, ""takes place in the Great Hall, as you are doubtless aware.""",actual presentation say take place great aware 
8,"""I--I have been given to understand so,"" said Horace, with a sinking heart--for he had begun to hope that the worst was over.",give understand say sink heart begin hope bad 
9,"""But before we adjourn,"" said his host, ""you will let me tempt you to partake of some slight refreshment--just a snack?""",adjourn say host let temp partake slight refreshment snack 
10,"Horace was not hungry, but it occurred to him that he might get through the ceremony with more credit after a glass of champagne; so he accepted the invitation, and was conducted to an extemporised buffet at one end of the Library, where he fortified himself for the impending ordeal with a _caviare_ sandwich and a bumper of the driest champagne in the Corporation cellars.",hungry occur get ceremony more credit glass champagne accept invitation conduct extemporised buffet end fortify impending ordeal _caviare_ sandwich bumper dry champagne cellar 
11,"""They talk of abolishing us,"" said the Lord Mayor, as he took an anchovy on toast; ""but I maintain, Mr. Ventimore--I maintain that we, with our ancient customs, our time-honoured traditions, form a link with the past, which a wise statesman will preserve, if I may employ a somewhat vulgar term, untinkered with.""",talk abolish say take anchovy toast maintain maintain ancient custom time honoure tradition form link past wise statesman preserve employ vulgar term untinkered 
12,"Horace agreed, remembering a link with a far more ancient past with which he devoutly wished he had refrained from tinkering.",agree remember link ancient past wish refrain tinker 
13,"""Talking of ancient customs,"" the Lord Mayor continued, with an odd blend of pride and apology, ""you will shortly have an illustration of our antiquated procedure, which may impress you as quaint.""",talk ancient custom continue odd blend pride apology have illustration antiquated procedure impress quaint 
14,"Horace, feeling absolutely idiotic, murmured that he felt sure it would do that.",feel idiotic murmure feel sure do 
15,"""Before presenting you for the freedom, the Prime Warden and five officials of the Candlestick-makers' Company will give their testimony as compurgators in your favour, making oath that you are 'a man of good name and fame,' and that (you will be amused at this, Mr. Ventimore)--that you 'do desire the freedom of this city, whereby to defraud the Queen or the City.' Ha, ha! Curious way of putting it, is it not?""",present freedom prime official maker company give testimony compurgator favour make oath man good name fame amuse desire freedom city defraud curious way put 
16,"""Very,"" said Horace, guiltily, and not a little concerned on the official's account.",say little concerned official account 
17,"""A mere form!"" said the Lord Mayor; ""but I for one, Mr. Ventimore--I for one should be sorry to see the picturesque old practices die out. To my mind,"" he added, as he finished a _pâté de foie gras_ sandwich, ""the modern impatience to sweep away all the ancient landmarks (whether they be superannuated or not) is one of the most disquieting symptoms of the age. You won't have any more champagne? Then I think we had better be making our way to the Great Hall for the Event of the Day.""",mere form say one sorry see picturesque old practice die mind add finish sandwich modern impatience sweep ancient landmark superannuate disquieting symptom age have more champagne think make way great 
18,"""I'm afraid,"" said Horace, with a sudden consciousness of his incongruously Oriental attire--""I'm afraid this is not quite the sort of dress for such a ceremony. If I had known----""",afraid say sudden consciousness oriental attire afraid sort dress ceremony know 
19,"""Now, don't say another word!"" said the Lord Mayor. ""Your costume is very nice--very nice indeed, and--and most appropriate, I am sure. But I see the City Marshal is waiting for us to head the procession. Shall we lead the way?""",say word say costume nice nice appropriate sure see wait head procession lead way 
20,"The band struck up the March of the Priests from _Athalie_, and Horace, his head in a whirl, walked with his host, followed by the City Lands Committee, the Sheriffs, and other dignitaries, through the Art Gallery and into the Great Hall, where their entrance was heralded by a flourish of trumpets.",band strike head whirl walk host follow other dignitary great entrance herald flourish trumpet 
21,"The Hall was crowded, and Ventimore found himself the object of a popular demonstration which would have filled him with joy and pride if he could only have felt that he had done anything whatever to justify it, for it was ridiculous to suppose that he had rendered himself a public benefactor by restoring a convicted Jinnee to freedom and society generally.",crowd find object popular demonstration fill joy pride feel do justify ridiculous suppose render public benefactor restore convict freedom society 
22,"His only consolation was that the English are a race not given to effusiveness without very good reason, and that before the ceremony was over he would be enabled to gather what were the particular services which had excited such unbounded enthusiasm.",only consolation race give effusiveness good reason ceremony enable gather particular service excite such unbounded enthusiasm 
23,"Meanwhile he stood there on the crimson-draped and flower-bedecked dais, bowing repeatedly, and trusting that he did not look so forlornly foolish as he felt. A long shaft of sunlight struck down between the Gothic rafters, and dappled the brown stone walls with patches of gold; the electric lights in the big hooped chandeliers showed pale and feeble against the subdued glow of the stained glass; the air was heavy with the scent of flowers and essences. Then there was a rustle of expectation in the audience, and a pause, in which it seemed to Horace that everybody on the dais was almost as nervous and at a loss what to do next as he was himself. He wished with all his soul that they would hurry the ceremony through, anyhow, and let him go.",stand crimson drape flower bedeck dais bow trust look foolish feel long shaft sunlight strike gothic rafter dapple brown stone wall patch gold electric light big hoop chandelier show pale feeble subdued glow stain glass air heavy scent flower essence be rustle expectation audience pause seem dais nervous loss do wish soul hurry ceremony let go 
24,"At length the proceedings began by a sort of solemn affectation of having merely met there for the ordinary business of the day, which to Horace just then seemed childish in the extreme; it was resolved that ""items 1 to 4 on the agenda need not be discussed,"" which brought them to item 5.",length proceedings begin sort solemn affectation meet ordinary business day seem childish extreme resolve item agenda discuss bring item 
25,"Item 5 was a resolution, read by the Town Clerk, that ""the freedom of the City should be presented to Horace Ventimore, Esq., Citizen and Candlestick-maker"" (which last Horace was not aware of being, but supposed vaguely that it had been somehow managed while he was at the buffet in the Library), ""in recognition of his services""--the resolution ran, and Horace listened with all his ears--""especially in connection with ..."" It was most unfortunate--but at this precise point the official was seized with an attack of coughing, in which all was lost but the conclusion of the sentence, "" ... that have justly entitled him to the gratitude and admiration of his fellow-countrymen.""",resolution read freedom present last aware suppose manage buffet recognition service resolution run listen ear connection unfortunate precise point official seize attack cough lose conclusion sentence entitle gratitude admiration fellow countryman 
26,Then the six compurgators came forward and vouched for Ventimore's fitness to receive the freedom. He had painful doubts whether they altogether understood what a responsibility they were undertaking--but it was too late to warn them and he could only trust that they knew more of their business than he did.,compurgator come vouch fitness receive freedom have painful doubt understand responsibility undertake late warn trust know more business 
27,"After this the City Chamberlain read him an address, to which Horace listened in resigned bewilderment. The Chamberlain referred to the unanimity and enthusiasm with which the resolution had been carried, and said that it was his pleasing and honourable duty, as the mouthpiece of that ancient City, to address what he described with some inadequacy as ""a few words"" to one by adding whose name to their roll of freemen the Corporation honoured rather themselves than the recipient of their homage.",read address listen resign bewilderment refer unanimity enthusiasm resolution carry say pleasing honourable duty mouthpiece ancient address describe inadequacy few word add name roll freemen honoure recipient homage 
28,"It was flattering, but to Horace's ear the phrases sounded excessive, almost fulsome--though, of course, that depended very much on what he had done, which he had still to ascertain. The orator proceeded to read him the ""Illustrious List of London's Roll of Fame,"" a recital which made Horace shiver with apprehension. For what names they were! What glorious deeds they had performed! How was it possible that he--plain Horace Ventimore, a struggling architect who had missed his one great chance--could have achieved (especially without even being aware of it) anything that would not seem ludicrously insignificant by comparison?",flattering ear phrase sound excessive fulsome course depend do have ascertain orator proceed read illustrious recital make shiver apprehension name glorious deed perform possible plain struggle architect miss great chance achieve aware seem insignificant comparison 
29,"He had a morbid fancy that the marble goddesses, or whoever they were, at the base of Nelson's monument opposite, were regarding him with stony disdain and indignation; that the statue of Wellington knew him for an arrant impostor, and averted his head with cold contempt; and that the effigy of Lord Mayor Beckford on the right of the dais would come to life and denounce him in another moment.",have morbid fancy marble goddess base monument regard stony disdain indignation statue know arrant impostor avert head cold contempt effigy right dais come life denounce moment 
30,"""Turning now to your own distinguished services,"" he suddenly heard the City Chamberlain resuming, ""you are probably aware, sir, that it is customary on these occasions to mention specifically the particular merit which had been deemed worthy of civic recognition.""",turn own distinguished service hear resume aware sir customary occasion mention particular merit deem worthy civic recognition 
31,"Horace was greatly relieved to hear it, for it struck him as a most sensible and, in his own particular case, essential formality.",relieved hear strike sensible own particular case essential formality 
32,"""But, on the present occasion, sir,"" proceeded the speaker, ""I feel, as all present must feel, that it would be unnecessary--nay, almost impertinent--were I to weary the public ear by a halting recapitulation of deeds with which it is already so appreciatively familiar."" At this he was interrupted by deafening and long-continued applause, at the end of which he continued: ""I have only therefore, to greet you in the name of the Corporation, and to offer you the right hand of fellowship as a Freeman, and Citizen, and Candlestick-maker of London.""",present occasion sir proceed speaker feel present feel unnecessary impertinent weary public ear halt recapitulation deed familiar interrupt deafen long continue applause end continue have greet name offer right hand fellowship maker 
33,"As he shook hands he presented Horace with a copy of the Oath of Allegiance, intimating that he was to read it aloud. Naturally, Ventimore had not the least objection to swear to be good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Victoria, or to be obedient to the Lord Mayor, and warn him of any conspiracies against the Queen's peace which might chance to come under his observation; so he took the oath cheerfully enough, and hoped that this was really the end of the ceremony.",shake hand present copy intimate read have least objection swear good true sovereign obedient warn conspiracy peace chance come observation take oath hope end ceremony 
34,"However, to his great chagrin and apprehension, the Lord Mayor rose with the evident intention of making a speech. He said that the conclusion of the City to bestow the highest honour in their gift upon Mr. Horace Ventimore had been--here he hesitated--somewhat hastily arrived at. Personally, he would have liked a longer time to prepare, to make the display less inadequate to, and worthier of, this exceptional occasion. He thought that was the general feeling. (It evidently was, judging from the loud and unanimous cheering). However, for reasons which--for reasons with which they were as well acquainted as himself, the notice had been short. The Corporation had yielded (as they always did, as it would always be their pride and pleasure to yield) to popular pressure which was practically irresistible, and had done the best they could in the limited--he might almost say the unprecedentedly limited--period allowed them. The proudest leaf in Mr. Ventimore's chaplet of laurels to-day was, he would venture to assert, the sight of the extraordinary enthusiasm and assemblage, not only in that noble hall, but in the thoroughfares of this mighty Metropolis. Under the circumstances, this was a marvellous tribute to the admiration and affection which Mr. Ventimore had succeeded in inspiring in the great heart of the people, rich and poor, high and low. He would not detain his hearers any longer; all that remained for him to do was to ask Mr. Ventimore's acceptance of a golden casket containing the roll of freedom, and he felt sure that their distinguished guest, before proceeding to inscribe his name on the register, would oblige them all by some account from his own lips of--of the events in which he had figured so prominently and so creditably.",great chagrin apprehension rise evident intention make speech say conclusion bestow high honour gift hesitate arrive like long time prepare make display inadequate worthier exceptional occasion think general feeling judge loud unanimous cheering reason reason acquainted notice short yield pride pleasure yield popular pressure irresistible do good limited say limited period allow proud leaf chaplet laurel day venture assert sight extraordinary enthusiasm assemblage noble hall thoroughfare mighty circumstance marvellous tribute admiration affection succeed inspire great heart person rich poor high low detain hearer remain do ask acceptance golden casket contain roll freedom feel sure distinguished guest proceed inscribe name register oblige account own lip event figure 
35,"Horace received the casket mechanically; there was a universal cry of ""Speech!"" from the audience, to which he replied by shaking his head in helpless deprecation--but in vain; he found himself irresistibly pressed towards the rail in front of the dais, and the roar of applause which greeted him saved him from all necessity of attempting to speak for nearly two minutes.",receive casket be universal cry speech audience reply shake head helpless deprecation vain find press rail front dais roar applause greet save necessity attempt speak minute 
36,"During that interval he had time to clear his brain and think what he had better do or say in his present unenviable dilemma. For some time past a suspicion had been growing in his mind, until it had now almost swollen into certainty. He felt that, before he compromised himself, or allowed his too generous entertainers to compromise themselves irretrievably, it was absolutely necessary to ascertain his real position, and, to do that, he must make some sort of speech. With this resolve, all his nervousness and embarrassment and indecision melted away; he faced the assembly coolly and gallantly, convinced that his best alternative now lay in perfect candour.",interval have time clear brain think do say present unenviable dilemma time suspicion grow mind swollen certainty feel compromise allow generous entertainer compromise necessary ascertain real position do make sort speech resolve nervousness embarrassment indecision melt face assembly convince good alternative lay perfect candour 
37,"""My Lord Mayor, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen,"" he began, in a clear voice which penetrated to the farthest gallery and commanded instant attention. ""If you expect to hear from me any description of what I've done to be received like this, I'm afraid you will be disappointed. For my own belief is that I've done nothing whatever.""",lord lady gentleman begin clear voice penetrate farthest gallery command instant attention expect hear description do receive afraid disappoint own belief do 
38,"There was a general outcry of ""No, no!"" at this, and a fervid murmur of protest.",be general outcry fervid murmur protest 
39,"""It's all very well to say 'No, no,'"" said Horace, ""and I am extremely grateful to you all for the interruption. Still, I can only repeat that I am absolutely unaware of having ever rendered my Country, or this great City, a single service deserving of the slightest acknowledgment. I wish I could feel I had--but the truth is that, if I have, the fact has entirely slipped from my memory.""",say say grateful interruption repeat unaware render great single service deserve slight acknowledgment wish feel have truth have fact slip memory 
40,"Again there were murmurs, this time with a certain under-current of irritation; and he could hear the Lord Mayor behind him remarking to the City Chamberlain that this was not at all the kind of speech for the occasion.",be murmur time certain current irritation hear remark kind speech occasion 
41,"""I know what you're thinking,"" said Horace. ""You're thinking this is mock modesty on my part. But it's nothing of the sort. _I_ don't know what I've done--but I presume you are all better informed. Because the Corporation wouldn't have given me that very charming casket--you wouldn't all of you be here like this--unless you were under a strong impression that I'd done _something_ to deserve it."" At this there was a fresh outburst of applause. ""Just so,"" said Horace, calmly. ""Well, now, will any of you be kind enough to tell me, in a few words, _what_ you suppose I've done?""",know think say think mock modesty part sort know do presume inform corporation give charming casket strong impression do _something_ deserve be fresh outburst applause say kind tell few word suppose do 
42,"There was a dead silence, in which every one looked at his or her neighbour and smiled feebly.",be dead silence one look neighbour smile 
43,"""My Lord Mayor,"" continued Horace, ""I appeal to you to tell me and this distinguished assembly why on earth we're all here!""",continue appeal tell distinguished assembly earth 
44,"The Lord Mayor rose. ""I think it sufficient to say,"" he announced with dignity, ""that the Corporation and myself were unanimously of opinion that this distinction should be awarded--for reasons which it is unnecessary and--hum--ha--invidious to enter into here.""",rise think sufficient say announce dignity opinion distinction award reason unnecessary hum invidious enter 
45,"""I am sorry,"" persisted Horace, ""but I must press your lordship for those reasons. I have an object.... Will the City Chamberlain oblige me, then?... No? Well, then, the Town Clerk?... No?--it's just as I suspected: none of you can give me your reasons, and shall I tell you why? Because there _aren't_ any.... Now, do bear with me for a moment. I'm quite aware this is very embarrassing for all of you--but remember that it's infinitely more awkward for _me_! I really cannot accept the freedom of the City under any suspicion of false pretences. It would be a poor reward for your hospitality, and base and unpatriotic into the bargain, to depreciate the value of so great a distinction by permitting it to be conferred unworthily. If, after you've heard what I am going to tell you, you still insist on my accepting such an honour, of course I will not be so ungracious as to refuse it. But I really don't feel that it would be right to inscribe my name on your Roll of Fame without some sort of explanation. If I did, I might, for anything I know, involuntarily be signing the death-warrant of the Corporation!""",sorry persist press lordship reason have object oblige suspect give reason tell bear moment aware embarrassing remember awkward accept freedom suspicion false pretence poor reward hospitality base unpatriotic bargain depreciate value great distinction permitt confer hear go tell insist accept honour course ungracious refuse feel right inscribe name sort explanation know sign death warrant corporation 
46,"There was a breathless hush upon this; the silence grew so intense that to borrow a slightly involved metaphor from a distinguished friend of the writer's, you might have picked up a pin in it! Horace leaned sideways against the rail in an easy attitude, so as to face the Lord Mayor, as well as a portion of his audience.",be breathless hush silence grow intense borrow involve metaphor distinguished friend writer pick pin learn rail easy attitude face portion audience 
47,"""Before I go any farther,"" he said, ""will your lordship pardon me if I suggest that it might be as well to direct that all reporters present should immediately withdraw?""",go say lordship pardon suggest direct reporter present withdraw 
48,"The reporters' table was instantly in a stir of anger, and many of the guests expressed some dissatisfaction. ""We, at least,"" said the Lord Mayor, rising, flushed with annoyance, ""have no reason to dread publicity. I decline to make a hole-and-corner affair of this. I shall give no such orders.""",reporter table stir anger many guest express dissatisfaction least say rise flush annoyance have reason dread publicity decline make hole corner affair give such order 
49,"""Very well,"" said Horace, when the chorus of approval had subsided. ""My suggestion was made quite as much in the Corporation's interests as mine. I merely thought that, when you all clearly understood how grossly you've been deluded, you might prefer to have the details kept out of the newspapers if possible. But if you particularly want them published over the whole world, why, of course----""",say chorus approval subside suggestion make much interest think understand delude prefer have detail keep newspaper possible want publish whole world course

51,"""Don't make this more difficult and disagreeable for me than it is already!"" said Horace, as soon as he could obtain a hearing again. ""You don't suppose that I should have come here in this Tom-fool's dress, imposing myself on the hospitality of this great City, if I could have helped it! If you've been brought here under false pretences, so have I. If you've been made to look rather foolish, what is _your_ situation to mine? The fact is, I am the victim of a headstrong force which I am utterly unable to control....""",make difficult disagreeable say obtain hearing suppose come fool dress impose hospitality great help bring false pretence make look foolish _your_ situation fact victim headstrong force unable control 
52,"Upon this a fresh uproar arose, and prevented him from continuing for some time. ""I only ask for fair play and a patient hearing!"" he pleaded. ""Give me that, and I will undertake to restore you all to good humour before I have done.""",fresh uproar arise prevent continue time ask fair play patient hearing plead give undertake restore good humour do 
53,"They calmed down at this appeal, and he was able to proceed. ""My case is simply this,"" he said. ""A little time ago I happened to go to an auction and buy a large brass bottle....""",calm appeal able proceed case say little time happen go auction buy large brass bottle 
54,"For some inexplicable reason his last words roused the audience to absolute frenzy; they would not hear anything about the brass bottle. Every time he attempted to mention it they howled him down, they hissed, they groaned, they shook their fists; the din was positively deafening.",inexplicable reason last word rouse audience absolute frenzy hear brass bottle time attempt mention howl hiss groan shake fist din deafen 
55,"Nor was the demonstration confined to the male portion of the assembly. One lady, indeed, who is a prominent leader in society, but whose name shall not be divulged here, was so carried away by her feelings as to hurl a heavy cut-glass bottle of smelling-salts at Horace's offending head. Fortunately for him, it missed him and only caught one of the officials (Horace was not in a mood to notice details very accurately, but he had a notion that it was the City Remembrancer) somewhere about the region of the watch-pocket.",demonstration confine male portion assembly lady prominent leader society name divulge carry feeling hurl heavy cut -glass bottle smelling salt offend head miss catch official mood notice detail have notion region watch pocket

58,"Up and up he was carried, past the great chandeliers, between the carved and gilded rafters, pursued by a universal shriek of dismay and horror. Down below he could see the throng of pale, upturned faces, and hear the wild screams and laughter of several ladies of great distinction in violent hysterics. And the next moment he was in the glass lantern, and the latticed panes gave way like tissue paper as he broke through into the open air, causing the pigeons on the roof to whirr up in a flutter of alarm.",carry great chandelier carve gilded rafter pursue universal shriek dismay horror see throng pale upturned face hear wild scream laughter several lady great distinction violent hysterics next moment glass lantern latticed pane give way tissue paper break open air cause pigeon roof whirr flutter alarm
