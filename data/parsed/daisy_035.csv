4," The next day Ethel had hoped for a return to reason, but behold, the world was cross! The reaction of the long excitement was felt, Gertrude fretted, and was unwell; Aubrey was pettish at his lessons; and Mary and Blanche were weary, yawning and inattentive; every straw was a burden, and Miss Bracy had feelings.",next day hope return reason world cross reaction long excitement feel fret unwell pettish lesson weary yawn inattentive straw burden have feeling

21,"“Well, papa,” said Ethel, softened, yet wounded by his thinking it so impossible. “I had often thought I ought to tell her that these sensitive feelings of hers were nothing but temper; and perhaps--indeed I know I do--I partake of the general fractiousness of the house to-day, and I did not bear it so patiently as usual.

34,"Dr. May’s chivalrous feeling caused him to take the part of the weak, and he answered, “You know nothing about it. Among our own kith and kin we can afford to pass over slights, because we are sure the heart is right--we do not know what it is to be among strangers, uncertain of any claim to their esteem or kindness. Sad! sad!” he continued, as the picture wrought on him. “Each trifle seems a token one way or the other! I am very sorry I grieved the poor thing yesterday.

For fifty times that I have borne with her maundering, I have, at last, once told her the truth; and for that I am accused of want of forbearance! Now he will go and make much of her, and pity her, till she will think herself an injured heroine, and be worse than ever; and he will do away with all the good of my advice, and want me to ask her pardon for it--but that I never will.

43,"Meanwhile, Dr. May had been in the schoolroom. Miss Bracy had ceased her tears before he came--they had been her retort on Ethel, and she had not intended the world to know of them. Half disconcerted, half angry, she heard the doctor approach. She was a gentle, tearful woman, one of those who are often called meek, under an erroneous idea that meekness consists in making herself exceedingly miserable under every kind of grievance; and she now had a sort of melancholy satisfaction in believing that the young ladies had fabricated an exaggerated complaint of her temper, and that she was going to become injured innocence. To think herself accused of a great wrong, excused her from perceiving herself guilty of a lesser one.",schoolroom cease tear come retort intend world know half disconcert half angry hear doctor approach gentle tearful woman call erroneous idea meekness consist make miserable kind grievance have sort melancholy satisfaction believe young lady fabricate exaggerate complaint temper go become injure innocence think accuse great wrong excuse perceive guilty less one 
44,"“Miss Bracy,” said Dr. May, entering with his frank, sweet look, “I am concerned that I vexed you by taking the children to walk with me yesterday. I thought such little brats would be troublesome to any but their spoiling papa, but they would have been in safer hands with you. You would not have been as weak as I was, in regard to sugar-plums.”  Such amends as these confused Miss Bracy, who found it pleasanter to be lamentable with Ethel, than to receive a full apology for her imagined offence from the master of the house. Feeling both small and absurd, she murmured something of “oh, no,” and “being sure,” and hoped he was going, so that she might sit down to pity herself, for those girls having made her appear so ridiculous.",say enter frank sweet look concerned vex take child walk yesterday think such little brat troublesome spoil papa safe hand weak regard sugar plum such amend confuse find pleasanter lamentable receive full apology imagine offence master house feel small absurd murmure sure hope go sit pity girl make appear ridiculous 
45,"No such thing! Dr. May put a chair for her, and sat down himself, saying, with a smile, “You see, you must trust us sometimes, and overlook it, if we are less considerate than we might be. We have rough, careless habits with each other, and forget that all are not used to them.”",such thing put chair sit say smile see trust overlook considerate have rough careless habit other forget use

47,"“We wish to be,” said Dr. May, “but there are little neglects--or you think there are. I will not say there are none, for that would be answering too much for human nature, or that they are fanciful--for that would be as little comfort as to tell a patient that the pain is only nervous--”",wish say be little neglect think be say be answer much human nature fanciful little comfort tell patient pain nervous 
48,"Miss Bracy smiled, for she could remember instances when, after suffering much at the time, she had found the affront imaginary.",smile remember instance suffer much time find affront imaginary 
49,"He was glad of that smile, and proceeded. “You will let me speak to you, as to one of my own girls? To them, I should say, use the only true cure. Don’t brood over vexations, small or great, but think of them as trials that, borne bravely, become blessings.”",glad smile proceed let speak own girl say use only true cure briod vexation small great think trial borne become blessing 
50,"“Oh! but Dr. May!” she exclaimed, shocked; “nothing in your house could call for such feelings.”",exclaim shocked house call such feeling 
51,"“I hope we are not very savage,” he said, smiling; “but, indeed, I still say it is the safest rule. It would be the only one if you were really among unkind people; and, if you take so much to heart an unlucky neglect of mine, what would you do if the slight were a true one?”",hope savage say smile say safe rule only one unkind person take much heart unlucky neglect do slight true one 
52,“You are right; but my feelings were always over-sensitive;” and this she said with a sort of complacency.,right feeling sensitive say sort complacency

54,She felt as if she could at that moment.,feel moment

56,“Oh! they are most kind--”,kind 
57,"“But, you see, I must say this,” added Dr. May, somewhat hesitating, “as they have no mother to--to spare all this,” and then, growing clearer, he proceeded, “I must beg you to be forbearing with them, and not perplex yourself and them with arguing on what cannot be helped. They have not the experience that could enable them to finish such a discussion without unkindness; and it can only waste the spirits, and raise fresh subjects of regret. I must leave you--I hear myself called.”",see say add hesitate have mother spare grow clear proceed beg forbear perplex argue help experience enable finish discussion unkindness waste spirit raise fresh subject regret leave hear call 
58,"Miss Bracy began to be sensible that she had somewhat abused Ethel’s patience; and the unfortunate speech about the source of her sensitiveness did not appear to her so direfully cruel as at first. She hoped every one would forget all about it, and resolved not to take umbrage so easily another time, or else be silent about it, but she was not a person of much resolution.",begin sensible abuse patience unfortunate speech source sensitiveness appear cruel first hope one forget resolve take umbrage time silent person much resolution 
59,"The doctor found that Meta Rivers and her brother had brought Flora home, and were in the drawing-room, where Margaret was hearing another edition of the history of the fair, and a by-play was going on, of teasing Blanche about the chain.",doctor find brother bring draw room hear edition history fair play go tease chain

65,"“Do you think I cannot manage the Stoneborough folk?” said Flora, looking radiant with good humour, and conscious of power. “Poor Ethel! I am doing you good against your will! Never mind, here is wherewith to build the school, and the management will be too happy to fall into our hands. Do you think every one is as ready as you are, to walk three miles and back continually?”",think manage folk say look radiant good humour conscious power poor do good will mind build school management happy fall hand think one ready walk mile 
66,"There was sense in this; there always was sense in what Flora said, but it jarred on Ethel; and it seemed almost unsympathising in her to be so gay, when the rest were wearied or perturbed. Ethel would have been very glad of a short space to recollect herself, and recover her good temper; but it was late, and Flora hurried her to put on her bonnet, and come to the committee. “I’ll take care of your interests,” she said, as they set out. “You look as doleful as if you thought you should be robbed of Cocksmoor; but that is the last thing that will happen, you will see.”",be sense be sense say jarr seem unsympathising gay rest weary perturb glad short space recollect recover good temper late hurry put bonnet come committee take care interest say set look doleful think rob last thing happen see

73,"“You always mean to manage everything, and then you have no time!” said Ethel, sensible all the time of her own ill-humour, and of her sister’s patience and amiability, yet propelled to speak the unpleasant truths that in her better moods were held back.",mean manage have time say sensible time own ill humour sister patience amiability propel speak unpleasant truth good mood hold 
74,"Still Flora was good-tempered, though Ethel would almost have preferred her being provoked; “I know,” she said, “I have been using you ill, and leaving the world on your shoulders, but it was all in your service and Cocksmoor’s; and now we shall begin to be reasonable and useful again.”",good temper prefer provoke know say use ill leave world shoulder service begin reasonable useful

78,"“Young men never know how to talk to little girls,” was Flora’s reply.",young man know talk little girl reply 
79,"At this moment they came up with one of the Miss Andersons, and Flora began to exchange civilities, and talk over yesterday’s events with great animation. Her notice always gave pleasure, brightened as it was by the peculiarly engaging address which she had inherited from her father, and which, therefore, was perfectly easy and natural. Fanny Anderson was flattered and gratified, rather by the manner than the words, and, on excellent terms, they entered the committee-room, namely, the schoolmistress’s parlour.",moment come begin exchange civility talk yesterday event great animation notice give pleasure brighten engage address inherit father easy natural flatter gratified manner word excellent term enter committee room schoolmistress parlour 
80,"There were nine ladies on the committee--nine muses, as the doctor called them, because they produced anything but harmony. Mrs. Ledwich was in the chair; Miss Rich was secretary, and had her pen and ink, and account-book ready. Flora came in, smiling and greeting; Ethel, grave, earnest, and annoyed, behind her, trying to be perfectly civil, but not at all enjoying the congratulations on the successful bazaar. The ladies all talked and discussed their yesterday’s adventures, gathering in little knots, as they traced the fate of favourite achievements of their skill, while Ethel, lugubrious and impatient, beside Flora, the only one not engaged, and, therefore, conscious of the hubbub of clacking tongues.",be lady committee muse doctor call produce harmony chair secretary have pen ink account book ready come smile greeting grave earnest annoyed try civil enjoy congratulation successful bazaar lady talk discuss yesterday adventure gather little knot trace fate favourite achievement skill lugubrious impatient only one engage conscious hubbub clack tongue 
81,"At last Mrs. Ledwich glanced at the mistress’s watch, in its pasteboard tower, in Gothic architecture, and insisted on proceeding to business. So they all sat down round a circular table, with a very fine red, blue, and black oilcloth, whose pattern was inseparably connected, in Ethel’s mind, with absurdity, tedium, and annoyance.",last glance mistress watch pasteboard tower gothic architecture insist proceed business sit circular table fine red blue black oilcloth pattern connect mind absurdity tedium annoyance 
82,"The business was opened by the announcement of what they all knew before, that the proceeds of the fancy fair amounted to one hundred and forty-nine pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence.",business open announcement know proceed fancy fair amount pound shilling tenpence 
83,"Then came a pause, and Mrs. Ledwich said that next they had to consider what was the best means of disposing of the sum gained in this most gratifying manner. Every one except Flora, Ethel, and quiet Mrs. Ward, began to talk at once. There was a great deal about Elizabethan architecture, crossed by much more, in which normal, industrial, and common things, most often met Ethel’s ear, with some stories, second-hand, from Harvey Anderson, of marvellous mistakes; and, on the opposite side of the table, there was Mrs. Ledwich, impressively saying something to the silent Mrs. Ward, marking her periods with emphatic beats with her pencil, and each seemed to close with “Mrs. Perkinson’s niece,” whom Ethel knew to be Cherry’s intended supplanter. She looked piteously at Flora, who only smiled and made a sign with her hand to her to be patient. Ethel fretted inwardly at that serene sense of power; but she could not but admire how well Flora knew how to bide her time, when, having waited till Mrs. Ledwich had nearly wound up her discourse on Mrs. Elwood’s impudence, and Mrs. Perkinson’s niece, she leaned towards Miss Boulder, who sat between, and whispered to her, “Ask Mrs. Ledwich if we should not begin with some steps for getting the land.”",come pause say have consider good means dispose sum gain gratifying manner one quiet begin talk be great deal elizabethan architecture cross more normal industrial common thing meet ear story second hand marvellous mistake opposite side table be say silent mark period emphatic beat pencil seem close niece know intend supplanter look smile make sign hand patient fret serene sense power admire know bide time wait wind discourse impudence niece learn sit whisper ask begin step get land 
84,"Miss Boulder, having acted as conductor, the president exclaimed, “Just so, the land is the first consideration. We must at once take steps for obtaining it.” Thereupon Mrs. Ledwich, who “always did things methodically,” moved, and Miss Anderson seconded, that the land requisite for the school must be obtained, and the nine ladies held up their hands, and resolved it.",act conductor president exclaim land first consideration take step obtain do thing move second land requisite school obtain lady hold hand resolve 
85,"Miss Rich duly recorded the great resolution, and Miss Boulder suggested that, perhaps, they might write to the National Society, or Government, or something; whereat Miss Rich began to flourish one of the very long goose quills which stood in the inkstand before her, chiefly as insignia of office, for she always wrote with a small, stiff metal pen.",record great resolution suggest write national begin flourish long goose quill stand inkstand insignia office write small stiff metal pen 
86,"Flora here threw in a query, whether the National Society, or Government, or something, would give them a grant, unless they had the land to build upon?",throw query national give grant have land build 
87,"The ladies all started off hereupon, and all sorts of instances of hardness of heart were mentioned, the most relevant of which was, that the Church Building Society would not give a grant to Mr. Holloway’s proprietary chapel at Whitford, when Mrs. Ledwich was suddenly struck with the notion that dear Mr. Holloway might be prevailed on to come to Stoneborough to preach a sermon in the Minster, for the benefit of Cocksmoor, when they would all hold plates at the door. Flora gave Ethel a tranquillising pat, and, as Mrs. Ledwich turned to her, asking whether she thought Dr. May, or Dr. Hoxton, would prevail on him to come, she said, with her winning look, “I think that consideration had better wait till we have some more definite view. Had we not better turn to this land question?”",lady start hereupon sort instance hardness heart mention relevant give grant proprietary chapel strike notion dear prevail come preach sermon benefit hold plate door give tranquillise pat turn ask think prevail come say win look think consideration good wait have definite view turn land question 
88,"“Quite true!” they all agreed, but to whom did the land belong?--and what a chorus arose! Miss Anderson thought it belonged to Mr. Nicolson, because the wagons of slate had James Nicolson on them, and, if so, they had no chance, for he was an old miser--and six stories illustrative thereof ensued. Miss Rich was quite sure some Body held it, and Bodies were slow of movement. Mrs. Ledwich remembered some question of enclosing, and thought all waste lands were under the Crown; she knew that the Stoneborough people once had a right to pasture their cattle, because Mr. Southron’s cow had tumbled down a loam-pit when her mother was a girl. No, that was on Far-view down, out the other way! Miss Harrison was positive that Sir Henry Walkinghame had some right there, and would not Dr. May apply to him? Mrs. Grey thought it ought to be part of the Drydale estate, and Miss Boulder was certain that Mr. Bramshaw knew all about it.",true agree land belong chorus arise think belong wagon slate have have chance old miser story illustrative ensue sure body hold body slow movement remember question enclose think waste land know person have right pasture cattle cow tumble loam pit mother girl view other way positive have apply think part estate certain know 
89,"Flora’s gentle voice carried conviction that she knew what she was saying, when, at last, they left a moment for her to speak--(Ethel would have done so long ago). “If I am not mistaken, the land is a copyhold of Sir Henry Walkinghame, held under the manor of Drydale, which belongs to M---- College, and is underlet to Mr. Nicolson.”",gentle voice carry conviction know say last leave moment speak do mistaken land copyhold hold manor belong underlet 
90,"Everybody, being partially right, was delighted, and had known it all before; Miss Boulder agreed with Miss Anderson that Miss May had stated it as lucidly as Mr. Bramshaw could. The next question was, to whom to apply? and, after as much as was expedient had been said in favour of each, it was decided that, as Sir Henry Walkinghame was abroad, no one knew exactly where, it would be best to go to the fountain-head, and write at once to the principal of the college. But who was to write? Flora proposed Mr. Ramsden as the fittest person, but this was negatived. Every one declared that he would never take the trouble, and Miss Rich began to agitate her pens. By this time, however, Mrs. Ward, who was opposite to the Gothic clock-tower, began to look uneasy, and suggested, in a nervous manner, that it was half-past five, and she was afraid Mr. Ward would be kept waiting for his dinner. Mrs. Grey began to have like fears, that Mr. Grey would be come in from his ride after banking hours. The other ladies began to think of tea, and the meeting decided on adjourning till that day next week, when the committee would sit upon Miss Rich’s letter.",right delighted know agree state next question apply much expedient say favour decide know good go fountain head write principal college write propose fittest person negatived one declare take trouble begin agitate pen time opposite gothic clock tower begin look uneasy suggest nervous manner half past afraid keep wait dinner begin have fear come ride banking hour other lady begin think tea meeting decide adjourn day next week committee sit letter 
91,"“My dear Miss Flora!” began Miss Rich, adhering to her as they parted with the rest at the end of the street, “how am I to write to a principal? Am I to begin Reverend Sir, or My Lord, or is he Venerable, like an archdeacon? What is his name, and what am I to say?”",dear begin adhere part rest end street write principal begin venerable archdeacon name say

100,"“My dear Ethel! have I spoken a word contrary to my opinion? It is not fit for me, a girl of twenty, to go disputing and dragooning as you would have me; but a little savoir faire, a grain of common sense, thrown in among the babble, always works.

101,"Ethel did not answer; she had self-control enough left not to retort upon Flora’s estimate of herself, but the irritation was strong; she felt as if her cherished views for Cocksmoor were insulted, as well as set aside, by the place being made the occasion of so much folly and vain prattle, the sanctity of her vision of self-devotion destroyed by such interference, and Flora’s promises did not reassure her. She doubted Flora’s power, and had still more repugnance to the means by which her sister tried to govern; they did not seem to her straightforward, and she could not endure Flora’s complacency in their success. Had it not been for her real love for the place and people, as well as the principle which prompted that love, she could have found it in her heart to throw up all concern with it, rather than become a fellow-worker with such a conclave.",answer have self control leave retort estimate irritation strong feel cherish view insult set place make occasion much folly vain prattle sanctity vision self devotion destroy such interference promise reassure doubt power have more repugnance means sister try govern seem straightforward endure complacency success real love place person principle prompt love find heart throw concern become fellow worker conclave 
102,"Such were Ethel’s feelings as the pair walked down the street; the one sister bright and smiling with the good humour that had endured many shocks all that day, all good nature and triumph, looking forward to success, great benefit to Cocksmoor, and plenty of management, with credit and praise to herself; the other, downcast and irritable, with annoyance at the interference with her schemes, at the prospects of her school, and at herself for being out of temper, prone to murmur or to reply tartly, and not able to recover from her mood, but only, as she neared the house, lapsing into her other trouble, and preparing to resist any misjudged, though kind attempt of her father, to make her unsay her rebuke to Miss Bracy.

103,"Dr. May was at his study door as his daughters entered the hall, and Ethel expected the order which she meant to question; but, instead of this, after a brief inquiry after the doings of the nine muses, which Flora answered, so as to make him laugh, he stopped Ethel, as she was going upstairs, by saying, “I do not know whether this letter is intended for Richard, or for me. At any rate, it concerns you most.”",study door daughter enter hall expect order mean question brief inquiry doing muse answer make laugh stop go say know letter intend rate concern most 
104,"The envelope was addressed to the Reverend Richard May, D. D., Market Stoneborough, and the letter began, “Reverend Sir.” So far Ethel saw, and exclaimed, with amusement, then, with a long-drawn “Ah!” and an interjection, “My poor dear Una!” she became absorbed, the large tears--yes, Ethel’s reluctant tears gathering slowly and dropping.",envelope address letter begin see exclaim amusement long draw interjection poor dear become absorb large tear reluctant tear gather drop 
105,"The letter was from a clergyman far away in the north of England, who said he could not, though a stranger, resist the desire to send to Dr. May an account of a poor girl, who seemed to have received great benefits from him, or from some of his family, especially as she had shown great eagerness on his proposing to write.",letter clergyman north say stranger resist desire send account poor girl seem receive great benefit family show great eagerness propose write 
106,"He said it was nearly a year since there had come into his parish a troop of railwaymen and their families. For the most part, they were completely wild and rude, unused to any pastoral care; but, even on the first Sunday, he had noticed a keen-looking, freckled, ragged, unmistakably Irish girl, creeping into church with a Prayer-book in her hand, and had afterwards found her hanging about the door of the school. “I never saw a more engaging, though droll, wild expression, than that with which she looked up to me.” (Ethel’s cry of delight was at that sentence--she knew that look too well, and had yearned after it so often!) “I found her far better instructed than her appearance had led me to expect, and more truly impressed with the spirit of what she had learned than it has often been my lot to find children. She was perfect in the New Testament history”--(“Ah! that she was not, when she went away!”)--“and was in the habit of constantly attending church, and using morning and evening prayers.” (“Oh! how I longed, when she went away, to beg her to keep them up! Dear Una.”) “On my questions, as to how she had been taught, she always replied, ‘Mr. Richard May,’ or ‘Miss Athel.’ You must excuse me if I have not correctly caught the name from her Irish pronunciation.” (“I am afraid he thinks my name is Athaliah! But oh! this dear girl! How I have wished to hear of her!”) “Everything was answered with ‘Mr. Richard,’ or ‘Miss Athel’; and, if I inquired further, her face would light up with a beam of gratitude, and she would run on, as long as I could listen, with instances of their kindness. It was the same with her mother, a wild, rude specimen of an Irishwoman, whom I never could bring to church herself, but who ran on loudly with their praises, usually ending with ‘Heavens be their bed,’ and saying that Una had been quite a different girl since the young ladies and gentleman found her out, and put them parables in her head.",say year come parish troop railwaymen family most part wild rude unused pastoral care first notice keen look freckled ragged irish girl creep church prayer book hand have find hang door school see engage droll wild expression look cry delight sentence know look yearn find instruct appearance lead expect impressed spirit learn lot find child perfect new history go habit attend church use morning evening prayer long go beg keep dear question teach reply excuse catch name irish pronunciation afraid think name dear girl wish hear answer inquire face light beam gratitude run listen instance kindness same mother wild rude specimen bring church run praise end heavens bed say different girl young lady gentleman find put parable head 
107,"“For my own part, I can testify that, in the seven months that she attended my school, I never had a serious fault to find with her, but far more often to admire the earnestness and devout spirit, as well as the kindness and generosity apparent in all her conduct. Bad living, and an unwholesome locality, have occasioned a typhus fever among the poor strangers in this place, and Una was one of the first victims. Her mother, almost from the first, gave her up, saying she knew she was one marked for glory; and Una has been lying, day after day, in a sort of half-delirious state, constantly repeating hymns and psalms, and generally, apparently very happy, except when one distress occurred again and again, whether delirious or sensible, namely, that she had never gone to wish Miss May good-bye, and thank her; and that maybe she and Mr. Richard thought her ungrateful; and she would sometimes beg, in her phraseology, to go on her bare knees to Stoneborough, only to see Miss Athel again.",own part testify month attend school have serious fault find admire earnestness devout spirit kindness generosity apparent conduct bad living unwholesome locality occasion typhus fever poor stranger place first victim mother first give say know mark glory lie day day sort half delirious state repeat hymn psalm happy distress occur delirious sensible go wish good bye thank think ungrateful beg phraseology go bare knee see 
108,"“Her mother, I should say, told me the girl had been half mad at not being allowed to go and take leave of Miss May; and she had been sorry herself, but her husband had come home suddenly from the search for work, and, having made his arrangements, removed them at once, early the next morning--too early to go to the young lady; though, she said, Una did--as they passed through Stoneborough--run down the street before she was aware, and she found her sobbing, fit to break her heart, before the house.” (“Oh, why, why was I not up, and at the window! Oh, my Una! to think of that!”) “When I spoke of writing to let Miss May hear how it was, the poor girl caught at the idea with the utmost delight. Her weakness was too great to allow her to utter many words distinctly, when I asked her what she would have me say, but these were as well as I could understand:--‘The blessing of one, that they have brought peace unto. Tell them I pray, and will pray, that they may walk in the robe of glory--and tell Mr. Richard that I mind what he said to me, of taking hold on the sure hope. God crown all their crosses unto them, and fulfil all their desires unto everlasting life.’ I feel that I am not rendering her words with all their fervour and beauty of Irish expression, but I would that I could fully retain and transmit them, for those who have so led her must, indeed, be able to feel them precious. I never saw a more peaceful frame of penitence and joy. She died last night, sleeping herself away, without more apparent suffering, and will be committed to the earth on Sunday next, all her fellow-scholars attending; and, I hope, profiting by the example she has left.",mother say tell girl mad allow go take leave sorry husband come search work make arrangement remove next morning early go young lady say pass run street aware find sobbing fit break heart house window think speak writing let hear poor girl catch idea utmost delight weakness great allow utter many word ask have say understand blessing bring peace tell pray pray walk robe glory tell mind say take hold sure hope crown cross fulfil desire everlast life feel rendering word fervour beauty irish expression retain transmit lead able feel precious see peaceful frame penitence joy die last night sleep apparent suffering commit earth fellow scholar attend hope profit example leave

110,"Etheldred finished the letter through blinding tears, while rising sobs almost choked her. She ran away to her own room, bolted the door, and threw herself on her knees, beside her bed--now confusedly giving thanks for such results--now weeping bitterly over her own unworthiness. Oh! what was she in the sight of Heaven, compared with what this poor girl had deemed her--with what this clergyman thought her? She, the teacher, taught, trained, and guarded, from her infancy, by her wise mother, and by such a father! She, to have given way all day to pride, jealousy, anger, selfish love of her own will; when this poor girl had embraced, and held fast, the blessed hope, from the very crumbs they had brought her! Nothing could have so humbled the distrustful spirit that had been working in Ethel, which had been scotched into silence--not killed--when she endured the bazaar, and now had been indemnifying itself by repining at every stumbling-block. Her own scholar’s blessing was the rebuke that went most home to her heart, for having doubted whether good could be worked in any way, save her own.",finish letter blind tear rise sob choke run own room bolt door throw knee bed give thanks such result weep own unworthiness sight compare poor girl deem clergyman think teacher teach train guard infancy wise mother father give way day pride jealousy anger selfish love own will poor girl embrace hold bless hope very crumb bring humble distrustful spirit work scotch silence kill endure bazaar indemnify repine stumbling block own scholar blessing rebuke go heart doubt good work way save own
