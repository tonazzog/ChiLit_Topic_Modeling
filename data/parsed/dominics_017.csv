1,CHAPTER 16. GUINEA-PIGS AND TADPOLES ON STRIKE.,guinea pigs tadpoles strike 
2,"If anything had been required to make the ""strike"" of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles a serious matter, the ""affair of Greenfield senior's right foot"" undoubtedly had that effect.  The _eclat_ which that heroic exploit lent to the mutiny was simply marvellous.  The story was told with fifty exaggerations all over the school.  One report said that the whole body of the monitors had besieged the Fourth Junior door, and had been repulsed with heavy slaughter.  Another declared that Oliver had been captured by the fags, and branded on the soles of his feet with a G and a T, to commemorate the emancipation of the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles; and a third veracious narrative went so far as to say that the Upper Fifth and several members of the Sixth had humbly come and begged forgiveness for their past misdeeds, and were henceforth to become the fags of their late victims.",require make strike guinea pig tadpole serious matter affair senior right foot have effect _eclat_ heroic exploit loan mutiny marvellous story tell exaggeration school report say whole body monitor besiege fourth door repulse heavy slaughter declare capture fag brand sole foot commemorate emancipation guinea pig third veracious narrative go say upper fifth several member come begg forgiveness past misdeed henceforth become fag late victim 
3,"True or untrue as these stories were, any amount of glory accompanied the beginning of the strike, and there was sufficient sense of common danger to unite the youngsters in very close bonds.  You rarely caught a Guinea-pig or a Tadpole alone now; they walked about in dozens, and were very wide awake.  They assembled on every possible occasion in their room, and fortified their door with chairs and desks, and their zeal with fiery orations and excited conjurations.  One wretched youth who the first evening had been weak enough to poke his master's fire, was expelled ignominiously from the community, and for a week afterwards lived the life of an outcast in Saint Dominic's.  The youngsters were in earnest, and no mistake.  Stephen Greenfield, as was only natural, did not altogether find cause for exultation over the event which led to the strike.  For a whole day he was very angry on his brother's account, and threatened to stand aloof from the revolution altogether; but when it was explained to him this would lead to a general ""smash-up"" of the strike, and when it was further explained that the fellows who caught hold of his big brother's right foot couldn't possibly be expected to know to whom that foot belonged, he relented, and entered as enthusiastically as any one into the business.  Indeed, if all the rebels had been like Stephen, the fags at Saint Dominic's would be on strike to this day.  He contemplated martyrdom with the utmost equanimity, and the Inquisition itself never saw a more determined victim.",true untrue story amount glory accompany beginning strike be sufficient sense common danger unite youngster close bond catch guinea pig walk dozen wide awake assemble possible occasion room fortify door chair desk zeal fiery oration excite conjuration wretched youth first evening weak poke master fire expel community week live life outcast youngster earnest mistake natural find cause exultation event lead strike whole day angry brother account threaten stand aloof revolution explain lead general smash up strike explain fellow catch hold big brother right foot expect know foot belong relent enter one business rebel fag strike day contemplate martyrdom utmost equanimity see determined victim

12,"Loman was hardly a bully naturally.  It was always easier for him to be civil than to be angry, especially with small boys, but this cool defiance on the part of his fag was too much for any one's civility, and Loman began to be angry.",bully easy civil angry small boy cool defiance part fag much one civility begin angry

28,"He took up a ruler, and in his passion flung it at the luckless Stephen's head.  It struck him hard on the cheek.  The blood flushed to the boy's face as he stood a moment half-stunned and smarting with the pain, confronting his adversary.  Then he rushed blindly in and flung himself upon the bully.",take ruler passion flung luckless head strike cheek blood flush boy face stand moment half stunn smart pain confront adversary rush flung bully 
29,"Of course it was no match.  The small boy was at the mercy of the big one.  The latter was indeed taken aback for a moment at the fury of his young assailant, impotent as it was, but that was all.  He might have defended himself with a single hand; he might have carried the boy under one arm out into the passage.  But the evil spirit had been roused within him, and that spirit knew no mercy.  He struck out and fought his little foeman as if he had been one of his own size and strength.  For every wild, feeble blow Stephen aimed, Loman aimed a hard and straight blow back.  If Stephen wavered, Loman followed in as he would in a professional boxing match, and when at last the small boy gave up, exhausted, bleeding, and scarcely able to stand, his foe administered a parting blow, which, if he had struck no other, would have stamped him as a coward for ever.",course match small boy mercy big one latter take moment fury young assailant impotent defend single hand carry boy arm passage evil spirit rouse spirit know mercy strike fight little foeman own size strength wild feeble blow aim aim hard straight blow waver follow professional boxing match last small boy give exhaust bleed able stand foe administer part blow strike other stamp coward

31,"It was a critical moment for poor Stephen.  After all, was the ""strike"" worth all this hardship?  A single word would have saved him; whereas if he again defied his enemy, it was all up with him.",critical moment poor strike worth hardship single word save defy enemy 
32,"He did waver a moment; and lucky for him he did.  For just then the door opened, and Simon entered.  Stephen saw his chance.  Slipping to the open door, he mustered up energy to cry as loud as he could, ""No, I won't;"" and with that made good his escape into the passage, as done up as a small boy well could be without being quite floored.",waver moment lucky door open enter see chance slip open door muster energy cry make good escape passage do small boy floor 
33,"A dozen eager friends were at hand to aid in stopping the bleeding of their hero's nose, and to apply raw steak to his black eye.  The story of his desperate encounter flew on the wings of fame all over the school, and the glory and pride of the youngsters reached its climax when, that afternoon, Stephen with his face all on one side, his eye a bright green and yellow, and his under lip about twice its ordinary thickness, took his accustomed place in the arithmetic class of the Fourth Junior.",eager friend hand aid stop bleeding hero nose apply raw steak black eye story desperate encounter fly wing fame school glory pride youngster reach climax afternoon face side eye bright green yellow lip ordinary thickness take accustom place arithmetic class fourth

43,"""I should guess that by the state of your face.  Now, I don't want to know what the fight was about, though I dare say you'd like to tell me [Stephen was boiling to tell him].

48,Mr Rastle _was_ a queer man; he never took things as one expected. When Stephen expected him to be furious he was as mild as a lamb.  There was no making him out.,queer man take thing expect expect furious mild lamb be make 
49,"But this was certain: Stephen left his room a good deal more crestfallen than he entered it.  He had hoped to win Mr Rastle's sympathy and admiration by an account of his grievances, and, instead of that, he was sent off in disgrace, with an imposition for being rude, and feeling anything but a hero.",certain leave room good deal crestfallen enter hope win sympathy admiration account grievance send disgrace imposition rude feel hero

Besides, his head ached badly, and the bruise on his cheek, which he had scarcely felt among his other wounds, now began to swell and grow painful. Altogether, he was in the wars.",applause friend fail console head ach bruise cheek feel other wound begin swell grow painful war 
51,"He was groaning over his imposition late that evening in the class-room, feeling in dreadful dumps, and wishing he had never come to Saint Dominic's, when a hand laid on his shoulder made him start.  He looked up and saw Mr Rastle.",groan imposition evening class room feel dreadful dump wish come hand lay shoulder make start look see

59,"And certainly the pale, bruised, upturned face of the boy did not look very bright at that moment.",pale bruise upturned face boy look bright moment 
60,"Stephen Greenfield went off to bed that night in a perturbed state of mind and body.  He had stuck loyally to his promise not to fag, and he had earned the universal admiration of his comrades.  But, on the other hand, he had been awfully knocked about, and, almost as bad, he had been effectively snubbed by Mr Rastle.  He did not exactly know what to think of it all.  Had he done a fine deed or a foolish one? and what ought he to do to-morrow?",go bed night perturb state mind body stick promise fig earn universal admiration comrade other hand knock bad snubb know think do fine deed foolish one do

62,"When he woke Stephen was like a giant refreshed.  His eye was certainly a rather more brilliant yellow than the day before, and his cheek still wore a dull red flush.  But somehow he felt none of the misgivings and dumps that had oppressed him the night before.  He was full of hope again and full of courage.  The Guinea-pigs should never charge _him_ with treachery and desertion, and what he had gone through already in the ""good cause"" he would go through again.",wake giant refresh eye brilliant yellow day cheek wear dull red flush feel misgiving dump oppress night full hope full courage guinea pig charge treachery desertion go good cause go 
63,"With this determination he dressed and went down to school.  Loman, whose summons he expected every moment to hear, did not put him to the necessity of a renewed struggle.  From all quarters, too, encouraging reports came in from the various insurgents.  Paul announced that Greenfield senior took it ""like a lamb""; Bramble recounted how his ""nigger-driver,"" as he was pleased to call Wren, had chased him twice round the playground and over the top of the cricket-shed without being able to capture him; and most of the others had exploits equally heroic to boast of.  Things were looking up in the Fourth Junior.",determination dress go school summons expect moment hear put necessity renew struggle quarter encourage report come various insurgent announce senior take lamb recount nigger driver pleased call chase playground top cricket shed able capture most other have exploit heroic boast thing look fourth 
64,"They spent a merry morning, these young rebels, wondering in whispers over their lessons what this and that Sixth or Fifth Form fellow had done without them.  With great glee they imagined Raleigh blacking his own boots and Pembury boiling his own eggs, and the very idea of such wonders quite frightened them.  At that rate Saint Dominic's would come to a standstill altogether.",spend merry morning young rebel wonder whisper lesson sixth fifth form fellow do great glee imagine black own boot boil own egg very idea such wonder frighten rate come standstill

66,"""One's enough if he strikes you back,"" said Stephen, with a rueful grin.",enough strike say rueful grin

68,"""All very well,"" said Stephen; ""I wish you'd got my cheek.""",say wish get cheek

71,"""I always said you'd got an awful cheek of your own, young Greenfield,"" said Bramble, laughing, as if _he_ was the inventor of the joke. Stephen glowered at him.",say get awful cheek own young say laugh inventor joke glower 
72,"""Well, you said so yourself,"" put in Bramble, a little mildly, for since Stephen's exploit yesterday that young hero had advanced a good deal in the respect of his fellows.  ""But, I say, why don't you stick some lotion or something on it?  It'll never get right if you don't, will it, Padger?""",say put little exploit yesterday young hero advance good deal respect fellow say stick lotion get right

74,"The result of this friendly and witty conference was that Stephen took it into his head to cure his cheek, and to that end applied for leave from Mr Rastle to go down that afternoon to Maltby to get something from the chemist.",result friendly witty conference take head cure cheek end apply leave go afternoon get chemist 
75,"Mr Rastle gave him leave, and told him the best sort of lotion to ask for, and so, as soon as afternoon school was over, our young champion sallied boldly forth on his errand.  He felt very self-satisfied and forgiving to all the world as he walked along.  There was no doubt about it, he was a hero.  Every one seemed to take an interest in his black eye and sore cheek, from Mr Rastle downwards.  Very likely that fight of his with Loman yesterday would be recorded as long as Saint Dominic's remained, as the event which saved the lower school from the tyranny of the upper!",give leave tell good sort lotion ask afternoon school young champion sall errand feel self satisfied forgiving world walk be doubt hero one seem take interest black eye sore cheek likely fight yesterday record remain event save low school tyranny upper 
76,"His way to the chemist's lay past the turning up to the Cockchafer, and the idea occurred to him to turn in on the way back and talk over the event of the hour with Mr Cripps, whom he had not seen since the bagatelle-lesson a week ago.  He was sure that good gentleman would sympathise with him, and most likely praise him; and in any case it would be only civil, after promising to come and see him sometimes, to look in.",way chemist lay turning idea occur turn way talk event hour see bagatelle lesson week sure good gentleman sympathise praise case civil promise come see look 
77,"The only thing was that the Cockchafer, whatever one might say about it, was a public-house.  The private door at the side hardly sufficed to satisfy Stephen that he was not breaking rules by going in.  He would not have entered by the public door for worlds, and the thought did occur to him, Was there very much difference after all between one door and the other?  However, he had not answered the question before he found himself inside, shaking hands with Mr Cripps.",only thing say public house private door side suffice satisfy break rule go enter public door world thought occur be much difference door other answer question find shake hand 
78,"That gentleman was of course delighted, and profuse in his gratitude to the ""young swell"" for looking him up.  He listened with profound interest and sympathy to his story, and made some very fierce remarks about what he would do to ""that there"" Loman if he got hold of him. Then the subject of bagatelle happened to come up, and presently Stephen was again delighting and astonishing the good gentleman by his skill in that game.  Then in due time it came out that the boy's mother had bought him a bicycle, and he was going to learn in the holidays, a resolution Mr Cripps highly approved of, and was certain a clever young fellow like him would learn in no time, which greatly pleased Stephen.",gentleman course delight profuse gratitude young swell look listen profound interest sympathy story make fierce remark do get hold subject bagatelle happen come delight astonish good gentleman skill game due time come boy mother buy bicycle go learn holiday resolution approve certain clever young fellow learn time pleased 
79,"Before parting, Mr Cripps insisted on lending his young friend a lantern for his bicycle, when he rode it in the dark.  It was a specially good one, he said, and the young gentleman could easily return it to him after the holidays, and so on.",part insist lend young friend lantern bicycle ride dark good one say young gentleman return holiday 
80,"Altogether it was a delightful visit, and Stephen wondered more than ever how some of the fellows could think ill of Mr Cripps.",delightful visit wonder more fellow think ill
