3," Poor little Gluck waited very anxiously alone in the house, for Hans' return. Finding he did not come back, he was terribly frightened, and went and told Schwartz in the prison, all that had happened. Then Schwartz was very much pleased, and said that Hans must certainly have been turned into a black stone, and he should have all the gold to himself. But Gluck was very sorry, and cried all night. When he got up in the morning, there was no bread in the house, nor any money; so Gluck went, and hired himself to another goldsmith, and he worked so hard, and so neatly, and so long every day, that he soon got money enough together, to pay his brother's fine, and he went, and gave it all to Schwartz, and Schwartz got out of prison. Then Schwartz was quite pleased, and said he should have some of the gold of the river. But Gluck only begged he would go and see what had become of Hans.",poor little wait house return find come frighten go tell prison happen pleased say turn black stone have gold sorry cry night get morning be bread house money go hire goldsmith work day get money pay brother fine go give get prison pleased say have gold river begg go see become 
4,"Now when Schwartz had heard that Hans had stolen the holy water, he thought to himself that such a proceeding might not be considered altogether correct by the King of the Golden River, and determined to manage matters better. So he took some more of Gluck's money, and went to a bad priest, who gave him some holy water very readily for it. Then Schwartz was sure it was all quite right. So Schwartz got up early in the morning before the sun rose, and took some bread and wine, in a basket, and put his holy water in a flask, and set off for the mountains. Like his brother he was much surprised at the sight of the glacier, and had great difficulty in crossing it, even after leaving his basket behind him. The day was cloudless, but not bright: there was a heavy purple haze hanging over the sky, and the hills looked lowering and gloomy. And as Schwartz climbed the steep rock path, the thirst came upon him, as it had upon his brother, until he lifted his flask to his lips to drink. Then he saw the fair child lying near him on the rocks, and it cried to him, and moaned for water. ""Water indeed,"" said Schwartz; ""I haven't half enough for myself,"" and passed on. And as he went he thought the sunbeams grew more dim, and he saw a low bank of black cloud rising out of the West; and, when he had climbed for another hour, the thirst overcame him again, and he would have drunk. Then he saw the old man lying before him on the path, and heard him cry out for water. ""Water, indeed,"" said Schwartz, ""I haven't half enough for myself,"" and on he went.",hear steal holy water think proceeding consider correct golden determine manage matter good take more money go bad priest give holy water sure right get morning sun rise take bread wine basket put holy water flask set mountain brother surprise sight glacier have great difficulty cross leave basket day cloudless bright be heavy purple haze hang sky hill look lower gloomy climb steep rock path thirst come have brother lift flask lip drink see fair child lie rock cry moan water water say enough pass go think sunbeam grow dim see low bank black cloud rising climb hour thirst overcame drunk see old man lie path hear cry water water say enough go

6,"Then again the light seemed to fade from before his eyes, and he looked up, and, behold, a mist, of the colour of blood, had come over the sun; and the bank of black cloud had risen very high, and its edges were tossing and tumbling like the waves of the angry sea. And they cast long shadows, which flickered over Schwartz's path.",light seem fade eye look mist colour blood come sun bank black cloud rise high edge toss tumble wave angry sea cast long shadow flicker path 
7,"Then Schwartz climbed for another hour, and again his thirst returned; and as he lifted his flask to his lips, he thought he saw his brother Hans lying exhausted on the path before him, and, as he gazed, the figure stretched its arms to him, and cried for water. ""Ha, ha,"" laughed Schwartz, ""are you there? remember the prison bars, my boy. Water, indeed! do you suppose I carried it all the way up here for _you_?"" And he strode over the figure; yet, as he passed, he thought he saw a strange expression of mockery about its lips. And, when he had gone a few yards farther, he looked back; but the figure was not there.",climb hour thirst return lift flask lip think see brother lie exhaust path gaze figure stretch arm cry water laugh remember prison bar boy water suppose carry way strode figure pass think see strange expression mockery lip go few yard look figure 
8,"And a sudden horror came over Schwartz, he knew not why; but the thirst for gold prevailed over his fear, and he rushed on. And the bank of black cloud rose to the zenith, and out of it came bursts of spiry lightning, and waves of darkness seemed to heave and float between their flashes, over the whole heavens. And the sky where the sun was setting was all level, and like a lake of blood; and a strong wind came out of that sky, tearing its crimson clouds into fragments, and scattering them far into the darkness. And when Schwartz stood by the brink of the Golden River, its waves were black, like thunder clouds, but their foam was like fire; and the roar of the waters below, and the thunder above met, as he cast the flask into the stream. And, as he did so, the lightning glared in his eyes, and the earth gave way beneath him, and the waters closed over his cry. And the moaning of the river rose wildly into the night, as it gushed over the",sudden horror come know thirst gold prevail fear rush bank black cloud rise zenith come burst spiry lightning wave darkness seem heave float flash whole heaven sky sun set level lake blood strong wind come sky tear crimson cloud fragment scatter darkness stand brink golden wave black thunder cloud foam fire roar water thunder meet cast flask stream do lightning glare eye earth give way water close cry moan river rise night gush
