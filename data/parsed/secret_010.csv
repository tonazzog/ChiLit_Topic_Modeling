1,CHAPTER X. DICKON,
2," The sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden.  The Secret Garden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it.  She liked the name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful old walls shut her in no one knew where she was.  It seemed almost like being shut out of the world in some fairy place.  The few books she had read and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret gardens in some of the stories.  Sometimes people went to sleep in them for a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid.  She had no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming wider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite.  She was beginning to like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it.  She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred.  The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.  Such nice clear places were made round them that they had all the breathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously.  The sun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.",sun shine week secret garden secret call think like name like feeling beautiful old wall shut know seem shut world fairy place few book read like fairy story book read secret garden story person go sleep year think stupid have intention go sleep fact become wide awake day pass begin like door hate wind enjoy run fast skip bulb secret garden astonished such nice clear place make have breathing space want know begin cheer dark earth work sun get warm rain come reach begin feel alive 
3,"Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something interesting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed. She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more pleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it.  It seemed to her like a fascinating sort of play.  She found many more of the sprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find.  They seemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. There were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the ""snowdrops by the thousands,"" and about bulbs spreading and making new ones.  These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they had spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands.  She wondered how long it would be before they showed that they were flowers.  Sometimes she stopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would be like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom. During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben Weatherstaff.  She surprised him several times by seeming to start up beside him as if she sprang out of the earth.  The truth was that she was afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible.  But, in fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.  Then, also, she was more civil than she had been.  He did not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them to do things.",odd determined little person have interesting determine absorb work dig pull weed become pleased work hour tiring seem fascinating sort play find many more sprout pale green point hope find seem start day sure find tiny new one tiny peep earth be many remember say snowdrop thousand bulb spread make new one leave year spread snowdrop thousand wonder show flower stop digg look garden try imagine cover thousand lovely thing bloom week sunshine become intimate surprise several time seem start spring earth truth afraid pick tool go see come walk possible fact object have first flatter evident desire elderly company civil know see speak speak native know cross sturdy old man accustom salaam master command do thing

13,"There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.  His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings and tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively graces.  He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him.  But Ben was sarcastic.",robin think look nice red waistcoat glossy satin flirt wing tail tilt head hopp sort lively grace seem determined make admire sarcastic

18,"The robin spread his wings--Mary could scarcely believe her eyes.  He flew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted on the top of it.  Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a new expression.  He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe--as if he would not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.  He spoke quite in a whisper.",robin spread wing believe eye fly handle spade alight top old man face wrinkle new expression stand afraid breathe stirr world robin start speak whisper

20,"And he stood without stirring--almost without drawing his breath--until the robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away.

45,"He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a little sorry for her.

46,She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as many questions as she dared.

He said something about roses just as she was going away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond of.,stay minute ask many question dare answer queer grunting way seem cross pick spade leave say rose go remind one say fond

51,"And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in staying another minute.  She went skipping slowly down the outside walk, thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was another person whom she liked in spite of his crossness.  She liked old Ben Weatherstaff.  Yes, she did like him.  She always wanted to try to make him talk to her.

52,"There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and ended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park.  She thought she would slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were any rabbits hopping about.  She enjoyed the skipping very much and when she reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she heard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it was.",be laurel hedge walk curved secret garden end gate open wood park think slip walk look wood see be rabbit hopping enjoy skip reach little gate open go hear low peculiar whistling sound want find 
53,"It was a very strange thing indeed.  She quite caught her breath as she stopped to look at it.  A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back against it, playing on a rough wooden pipe.  He was a funny looking boy about twelve.  He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round and such blue eyes in any boy's face.  And on the trunk of the tree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing with tremulous noses--and actually it appeared as if they were all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipe seemed to make.",strange thing catch breath stop look boy sit tree back play rough wooden pipe funny look boy look clean nose turn cheek red poppie have mistress see such round such blue eye boy face trunk tree learn brown squirrel cling watch bush cock pheasant stretch neck peep rabbit sit sniff tremulous nose appear draw watch listen strange low little call pipe seem make

55,"""Don't tha' move,"" he said.  ""It'd flight 'em."" Mary remained motionless.  He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise from the ground.  He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though he were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the squirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant withdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop away, though not at all as if they were frightened.",move say flight remain motionless stop play pipe begin rise ground move seem move last stand foot squirrel scamper branch tree pheasant withdraw head rabbit drop four begin hop frighten

It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would not like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes and with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head.  As she came closer to him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them.
