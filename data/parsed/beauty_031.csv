1,CHAPTER 31. A Humbug,
2," My master was not immediately suited, but in a few days my new groom came. He was a tall, good-looking fellow enough; but if ever there was a humbug in the shape of a groom Alfred Smirk was the man. He was very civil to me, and never used me ill; in fact, he did a great deal of stroking and patting when his master was there to see it. He always brushed my mane and tail with water and my hoofs with oil before he brought me to the door, to make me look smart; but as to cleaning my feet or looking to my shoes, or grooming me thoroughly, he thought no more of that than if I had been a cow. He left my bit rusty, my saddle damp, and my crupper stiff.",master suit few day new groom come tall good look fellow be humbug shape groom man civil use ill fact do great deal stroking pat master see brush mane tail water hoof oil bring door make look smart clean foot look shoe groom think more cow leave bit rusty saddle damp crupper stiff 
3,"Alfred Smirk considered himself very handsome; he spent a great deal of time about his hair, whiskers and necktie, before a little looking-glass in the harness-room. When his master was speaking to him it was always, “Yes, sir; yes, sir”--touching his hat at every word; and every one thought he was a very nice young man and that Mr. Barry was very fortunate to meet with him. I should say he was the laziest, most conceited fellow I ever came near. Of course, it was a great thing not to be ill-used, but then a horse wants more than that. I had a loose box, and might have been very comfortable if he had not been too indolent to clean it out. He never took all the straw away, and the smell from what lay underneath was very bad; while the strong vapors that rose made my eyes smart and inflame, and I did not feel the same appetite for my food.",consider handsome spend great deal time hair whisker necktie little look glass harness room master speak sir sir touch hat word one think nice young man fortunate meet say lazy conceited fellow come course great thing ill use horse want more have loose box comfortable indolent clean take straw smell lay bad strong vapor rise make eye smart inflame feel same appetite food 
4,"One day his master came in and said, “Alfred, the stable smells rather strong; should not you give that stall a good scrub and throw down plenty of water?”",day master come say stable smell strong give stall good scrub throw plenty water 
5,"“Well, sir,” he said, touching his cap, “I’ll do so if you please, sir; but it is rather dangerous, sir, throwing down water in a horse’s box; they are very apt to take cold, sir. I should not like to do him an injury, but I’ll do it if you please, sir.”",sir say touch cap do sir dangerous sir throw water horse box apt take cold sir like do injury do sir 
6,"“Well,” said his master, “I should not like him to take cold; but I don’t like the smell of this stable. Do you think the drains are all right?”",say master like take cold like smell stable think drain right 
7,"“Well, sir, now you mention it, I think the drain does sometimes send back a smell; there may be something wrong, sir.”",sir mention think drain send smell be wrong sir 
8,"“Then send for the bricklayer and have it seen to,” said his master.",send bricklayer have see say master 
9,"“Yes, sir, I will.”",sir 
10,"The bricklayer came and pulled up a great many bricks, but found nothing amiss; so he put down some lime and charged the master five shillings, and the smell in my box was as bad as ever. But that was not all: standing as I did on a quantity of moist straw my feet grew unhealthy and tender, and the master used to say:",bricklayer come pull great many brick find amiss put lime charge master shilling smell box bad standing do quantity moist straw foot grow unhealthy tender master use say 
11,“I don’t know what is the matter with this horse; he goes very fumble-footed. I am sometimes afraid he will stumble.”,know matter horse go fumble footed afraid stumble 
12,"“Yes, sir,” said Alfred, “I have noticed the same myself, when I have exercised him.”",sir say notice same exercise 
13,"Now the fact was that he hardly ever did exercise me, and when the master was busy I often stood for days together without stretching my legs at all, and yet being fed just as high as if I were at hard work. This often disordered my health, and made me sometimes heavy and dull, but more often restless and feverish. He never even gave me a meal of green food or a bran mash, which would have cooled me, for he was altogether as ignorant as he was conceited; and then, instead of exercise or change of food, I had to take horse balls and draughts; which, beside the nuisance of having them poured down my throat, used to make me feel ill and uncomfortable.",fact exercise master busy stand day stretch leg feed high hard work disorder health make heavy dull restless feverish give meal green food bran mash cool ignorant conceited exercise change food have take horse ball draught nuisance have pour throat use make feel ill uncomfortable 
14,"One day my feet were so tender that, trotting over some fresh stones with my master on my back, I made two such serious stumbles that, as he came down Lansdown into the city, he stopped at the farrier’s, and asked him to see what was the matter with me. The man took up my feet one by one and examined them; then standing up and dusting his hands one against the other, he said:",day foot tender trot fresh stone master back make such serious stumble come city stop farrier ask see matter man take foot examine stand dust hand other say 
15,"“Your horse has got the ‘thrush’, and badly, too; his feet are very tender; it is fortunate that he has not been down. I wonder your groom has not seen to it before. This is the sort of thing we find in foul stables, where the litter is never properly cleaned out. If you will send him here to-morrow I will attend to the hoof, and I will direct your man how to apply the liniment which I will give him.”",horse get thrush foot tender fortunate wonder groom see sort thing find foul stable litter clean send attend hoof direct man apply liniment give 
16,The next day I had my feet thoroughly cleansed and stuffed with tow soaked in some strong lotion; and an unpleasant business it was.,next day have foot cleanse stuff tow soak strong lotion unpleasant business 
17,"The farrier ordered all the litter to be taken out of my box day by day, and the floor kept very clean. Then I was to have bran mashes, a little green food, and not so much corn, till my feet were well again. With this treatment I soon regained my spirits; but Mr. Barry was so much disgusted at being twice deceived by his grooms that he determined to give up keeping a horse, and to hire when he wanted one. I was therefore kept till my feet were quite sound, and was then sold again.",farrier order litter take box day day floor keep clean have bran mashe little green food much corn foot treatment regain spirit disgusted deceive groom determine give keep horse hire want keep foot sound sell
