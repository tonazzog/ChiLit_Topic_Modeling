2,"Annie continued her walk.  The circumstances of the last two months had combined to do for her what nothing had hitherto effected.  When a little child she had known hardship and privation, she had passed through that experience which is metaphorically spoken of as ""going down hill.""  As a baby little Annie had been surrounded by comforts and luxuries, and her father and mother had lived in a large house, and kept a carriage, and Annie had two nurses to wait on herself alone.  These were in the days before she could remember anything.  With her first early memories came the recollection of a much smaller house, of much fewer servants, of her mother often in tears, and her father often away. Then there was no house at all that the Forests could call their own, only rooms of a tolerably cheerful character, and Annie's nurse went away, and she look her daily walks by her mother's side and slept in a little cot in her mother's room.  Then came a very, very sad day, when her mother lay cold and still and fainting on her bed, and her tall and handsome father caught Annie in his arms and pressed her to his heart, and told her to be a good child and to keep up her spirits, and, above all things, to take care of mother.  Then her father had gone away; and though Annie expected him back, he did not come, and she and her mother went into poorer and shabbier lodgings, and her mother began to try her tear-dimmed eyes by working at church embroidery, and Annie used to notice that she coughed a good deal as she worked.  Then there was another move, and this time Mrs Forest and her little daughter found themselves in one bedroom, and things began to grow very gloomy and food even was scarce.  At last there was a change.  One day a lady came into the dingy little room, and all of a sudden it seemed as if the sun had come out again.  This lady brought comforts with her--toys and books for the child, good, brave words of cheer for the mother.  At last Annie's mother died, and she went away to Lavender House to live with this good friend who had made her mother's dying hours easy.",continue walk circumstance last month combine do effect little child know hardship privation pass experience speak go hill baby little surround comfort luxury father mother live large house keep carriage have nurse wait day remember first early memory come recollection small house few servant mother tear father be house call own room cheerful character nurse go look daily walk mother side sleep little cot mother room come sad day mother lay cold fainting bed tall handsome father catch arm press heart tell good child keep spirit thing take care mother father go expect come mother go poorer shabb lodging mother begin try tear dimm eye work church embroidery use notice cough good deal work be move time little daughter find bedroom thing begin grow gloomy food scarce last be change day lady come dingy little room seem sun come lady bring comfort toy book child good brave word cheer mother last mother die go live good friend make mother die hour easy 
3,"""Annie, Annie,"" said the dying mother, ""I owe everything to Mrs Willis; we knew each other long ago when we were girls, and she has come to me now and made everything easy.  When I am gone she will take care of you. Oh, my child, I cannot repay her; but will you try?""",say die mother owe know other girl come make easy gone take care child repay try 
4,"""Yes, mother,"" said little Annie, gazing full into her mother's face with her sweet bright eyes, ""I'll--I'll love her, mother; I'll give her lots and lots of love.""",mother say little gaze full mother face sweet bright eye love mother give lot lot love 
5,"Annie had gone to Lavender House, and kept her word, for she had almost worshipped the good mistress who was so true and kind to her, and who had so befriended her mother.  Through all the vicissitudes of her short existence Annie had, however, never lost one precious gift.  Hers was an affectionate, but also a wonderfully bright, nature.  It was as impossible for Annie to turn away from laughter and merriment as it would be for a flower to keep its head determinedly turned from the sun. In their darkest days Annie had managed to make her mother laugh; her little face was a sunbeam, her very naughtinesses were of a laughable character.",go keep word worship good mistress true kind befriend mother vicissitude short existence lose precious gift affectionate bright nature impossible turn laughter merriment flower keep head turn sun dark day manage make mother laugh little face sunbeam very naughtiness laughable character 
6,"Her mother died--her father was still away, but Annie retained her brave and cheerful spirit, for she gave and received love.  Mrs Willis loved her--she bestowed upon her amongst all her girls the tenderest glances, the most motherly caresses.  The teachers undoubtedly corrected and even scolded her, but they could not help liking her, and even her worst scrapes made them smile.  Annie's companions adored her; the little children would do anything for their own Annie, and even the servants in the school said that there was no young lady in Lavender House fit to hold a candle to Miss Forest.",mother die father retain brave cheerful spirit give receive love love bestow girl tenderest glance motherly caresse teacher correct scold help like bad scrape make smile companion adore little child do own servant school say be young lady fit hold candle 
7,"During the last half-year, however, things had been different. Suspicion and mistrust began to dog the footsteps of the bright young girl; she was no longer a universal favourite--some of the girls even openly expressed their dislike of her.",last half year thing different suspicion mistrust begin dog footstep bright young girl universal favourite girl express dislike 
8,"All this Annie could have borne, but for the fact that Mrs Willis joined in the universal suspicion.  The old glance now never came to her eyes, nor the old tone to her voice.  For the first time Annie's spirits utterly flagged; she could not bear this universal coldness, this universal chill.  She began to droop physically as well as mentally.",borne fact join universal suspicion old glance come eye old tone voice first time spirit flagge bear universal coldness universal chill begin driop 
9,"She was pacing up and down the walk, thinking very sadly, wondering vaguely if her father would ever return, and conscious of a feeling of more or less indifference to everything and everyone, when she was suddenly roused from her meditation by the patter of small feet and by a very eager little exclamation--",pace walk think wonder father return conscious feeling more less indifference rouse meditation patter small foot eager little exclamation

15,"""Dearest little darling,"" said Annie in a voice of almost passionate pain; then, with that wonderful instinct which made her in touch with all little children, she cheered up, wiped away her tears, and allowed laughter once more to wreathe her lips and fill her eyes.  ""Come, Nan,"" she said, ""you and I will have such a race.""",dearest little darling say voice passionate pain wonderful instinct make touch little child cheer wipe tear allow laughter more wreathe lip fill eye come say have race 
16,"She placed the child on her shoulder, clasped the little hands securely round her neck, and ran to the sound of Nan's shouts down the shady walk.",place child shoulder clasp little hand neck run sound shout shady walk 
17,"At the farther end Nan suddenly tightened her clasp, drew herself up, ceased to laugh, and said with some fright in her voice--",far end tighten clasp draw cease laugh say fright voice

25,"""Only waiting to see you, pretty Missie,"" replied the tall gypsy.  ""You are the dear little lady who crossed my hand with silver that night in the wood.  Eh, but it was a bonny night, with a bonny bright moon, and none of the dear little ladies meant any harm--no, no.  Mother Rachel knows that.""",wait see reply tall gypsy dear little lady cross hand silver night wood bonny night bonny bright moon dear little lady mean harm know 
26,"""Look here,"" said Annie, ""I'm not going to be afraid of you.  I have no more silver to give you.  If you like, you may go up to the house and tell what you have seen.  I am very unhappy, and whether you tell or not can make very little difference to me now.  Good-night; I am not the least afraid of you--you can do just as you please about telling Mrs Willis.""",look say go afraid have more silver give like go house tell see unhappy tell make little difference good night least afraid do tell

32,"""Oh, no,"" she laughed, after a moment; ""the little Missy thinks she ain't afraid of me; but she be.  Trust Mother Rachel for knowing that much.  I make no doubt,"" she added after a pause, ""that the little one's clothes are trimmed with real lace.  Well, little Missie Annie Forest, I can see with half an eye that you set store by that baby-girl.
