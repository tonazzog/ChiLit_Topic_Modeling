3," After his last interview with Philip, Guy returned to his rooms to force himself into occupation till his cousin should come to acknowledge that here, at least, there was nothing amiss. He trusted that when it was proved all was right in this quarter, the prejudice with regard to the other might be diminished, though his hopes were lower since he had found out the real grounds of the accusation, reflecting that he should never be able to explain without betraying his uncle.",last interview return room force occupation cousin come acknowledge least be amiss trust prove right quarter prejudice regard other diminish hope low find real grounds accusation reflect able explain betray uncle 
4,"He waited in vain. The hour passed at which Philip’s coming was possible; Guy was disappointed, but looked for a letter; but post after post failed to bring him one. Perhaps Philip would write from Hollywell, or else Mr. Edmonstone would write, or at least he was sure that Charles would write--Charles, whose confidence and sympathy, expressed in almost daily letters, had been such a comfort. But not a line came. He reviewed in memory his last letter to Charles, wondering whether it could have offended him; but it did not seem possible; he thought over all that Philip could have learnt in his visit, to see if it could by any means have been turned to his disadvantage. But he knew he had done nothing to which blame could be attached; he had never infringed the rules of college discipline; and though still backward, and unlikely to distinguish himself, he believed that was the worst likely to have been said of him. He only wished his true character was as good as what would be reported of him.",wait vain hour pass come possible guy disappoint look letter post post fail bring write else write least sure write confidence sympathy express daily letter comfort line come review memory last letter wonder offend seem possible think learn visit see means turn disadvantage know do blame attach infring rule college discipline backward unlikely distinguish believe bad likely say wish true character good report 
5,"As he thought and wondered, he grew more and more restless and unhappy. He could imagine no reason for the silence, unless Mr. Edmonstone had absolutely forbidden any intercourse, and it did not seem probable that he would issue any commands in a manner to bind a grown-up son, more especially as there had been no attempt at communication with Amy. It was terrible thus, without warning, to be cut off from her, and all besides that he loved. As long as Charles wrote, he fancied her sitting by, perhaps sealing the letter, and he could even tell by the kind of paper and envelope, whether they were sitting in the dressing-room or down-stairs; but now there was nothing, no assurance of sympathy, no word of kindness; they might all have given him up; those unhappy words were like a barrier, cutting him off for ever from the happiness of which he had once had a glimpse. Was the Redclyffe doom of sin and sorrow really closing in upon him?",think wonder grow restless unhappy imagine reason silence forbidden intercourse seem probable issue command manner bind grow son be attempt communication terrible warning cut love write fancy sit seal letter tell kind paper envelope sit dress room stair be assurance sympathy word kindness give unhappy word barrier cut happiness have glimpse doom sin sorrow close 
6,"If it had not been for chapel and study, he hardly knew how he should have got through that term; but as the end of it approached, a feverish impatience seized on him whenever the post came in, for a letter, if only to tell him not to come to Hollywell. None came, and he saw nothing for it but to go to Redclyffe; and if he dreaded seeing it in its altered state when his spirits were high and unbroken, how did he shrink from it now! He did, however, make up his mind, for he felt that his reluctance almost wronged his own beloved home. Harry Graham wanted to persuade him to come and spend Christmas at his home, with his lively family, but Guy felt as if gaiety was not for him, even if he could enjoy it. He did not wish to drown his present feelings, and steadily, though gratefully, refused this as well as one or two other friendly invitations.",chapel study know get term end approach feverish impatience seize post come letter tell come come see go dread see alter state spirit high unbroken shrink make mind feel reluctance wrong own beloved home want persuade come spend home lively family guy feel gaiety enjoy wish drown present feeling refuse other friendly invitation

8,"Railroads had come a step nearer, even to his remote corner of the world, in the course of the last three years; but there was still thirty miles of coach beyond, and these lay through a part of the country he had never seen before. It was for the most part bleak, dreary moor, such as, under the cold gray wintry sky, presented nothing to rouse him from his musings on the welcome he might have been at that very moment receiving at Hollywell.",railroad come step remote corner world course last year be mile coach lay part country see part bleak dreary moor such cold gray wintry sky present rouse musing welcome very moment receive 
9,"A sudden, dip in the high ground made it necessary for the coach to put on the drag, and thus it slowly entered a village, which attracted attention from its wretched appearance. The cottages, of the rough stone of the country, were little better than hovels; slates were torn off, windows broken. Wild-looking uncombed women, in garments of universal dirt colour, stood at the doors; ragged children ran and shrieked after the coach, the church had a hole in the roof, and stood tottering in spite of rude repairs; the churchyard was trodden down by cattle, and the whole place only resembled the pictures of Irish dilapidation.",sudden dip high ground make necessary coach put drag enter village attract attention wretched appearance cottage rough stone country little good hovel slate tear window break wild look uncombed woman garment universal dirt colour stand door ragged child run shriek coach church have hole roof stand totter spite rude repair churchyard trodd cattle whole place resemble picture irish dilapidation

They call it Coombe Prior.’",miserable place ask passenger gentleman ask reply coachman be note place thief vagabond call

22,"After a few more civilities, Guy was at liberty to attend to the fresh influx of sad musings on thoughtless waste affecting not only the destiny of the individual himself, but whole generations besides. How many souls might it not have ruined? ‘These sheep, what had they done!’ His grandfather had repented, but who was to preach repentance unto these? He did not wonder now that his own hopes of happiness had been blighted; he only marvelled that a bright present or future had ever been his--",few more civility liberty attend fresh influx sad musing thoughtless waste affect destiny individual whole generation many soul ruin sheep do grandfather repent preach repentance wonder own hope happiness blight marvel bright present future

25,"Miles were passed in one long melancholy musing, till Guy was roused by the sight of familiar scenes, and found himself rattling over the stones of the little borough of Moorworth, with the gray, large-windowed, old-fashioned houses, on each side, looking at him with friendly eyes. There, behind those limes cut out in arches, was the commercial school, where he had spent many an hour in construing with patient Mr. Potts; and though he had now a juster appreciation of his old master’s erudition, which he had once thought so vast, he recollected with veneration his long and patient submission to an irksome, uncongenial life. Rumbling on, the coach was in the square market-place, the odd-looking octagon market-house in the middle, and the inn--the respectable old ‘George’--with its long rank of stables and out-buildings forming one side. It was at this inn that Guy had been born, and the mistress having been the first person who had him in her arms, considered herself privileged to have a great affection for him, and had delighted in the greetings he always exchanged with her when he put up his pony at her stable, and went to his tutor.",pass long melancholy musing rouse sight familiar scene find rattling stone little borough gray large windowed old fashioned house side look friendly eye lime cut arche commercial school spend many hour construe patient have juster appreciation old master erudition think vast recollect veneration long patient submission irksome uncongenial life rumble coach square market place odd look octagon market house middle inn respectable old long rank stable building form side inn bear mistress first person have arm consider privileged have great affection delight greeting exchange put pony stable go tutor

27,"The next moment Mrs. Lavers was at the door herself, with her broad, good-humoured face, close cap, bright shawl, and black gown, just as Guy always recollected, and might, if he could, have recollected, when he was born. If she had any more guests she neither saw nor cared for them; her welcome was all for him; and he could not but smile and look cheerful, if only that he might not disappoint her, feeling, in very truth, cheered and gratified by her cordiality. If he was in a hurry, he would not show it; and he allowed her to seat him in her own peculiar abode, behind the glass-cases of tongue and cold chicken, told her he came from Oxford, admired her good fire, and warmed his hands over it, before he even asked if the ‘something’ had arrived which was to take him home. It was coming to the door at the moment, and proved to be Mr. Markham’s tall, high-wheeled gig, drawn by the old white-faced chestnut, and driven by Markham himself--a short, sturdy, brown-red, honest-faced old man, with frosted hair and whiskers, an air more of a yeoman than of a lawyer; and though not precisely gentlemanlike, yet not ungentlemanlike, as there was no pretension about him.",next moment door broad good humoured face close cap bright shawl black gown guy recollect recollect bear have more guest see care welcome smile look cheerful disappoint feel truth cheer gratified cordiality hurry show allow seat own peculiar abode glass case tongue cold chicken tell come admire good fire warm hand ask arrive take come door moment prove tall high wheel gig draw old white face chestnut drive short sturdy brown red honest face old man frost hair whisker air more yeoman lawyer gentlemanlike ungentlemanlike be pretension

62,"As if it was an immense relief to his mind, Markham launched out into a discourse on the extreme folly, imprudence, and all other evils of such carelessness. He was so glad to find this was the worst, that his lecture lasted for two miles and a half, during which Guy, though attentive at first, had ample space for all the thrills of recognition at each well-known spot.",immense relief mind launch discourse extreme folly imprudence other evil such carelessness glad find bad lecture last mile half attentive have ample space thrill recognition know spot 
63,"There was the long green-wooded valley between the hills where he had shot his first woodcock; there was the great stone on which he had broken his best knife in a fit of geological research; there was the pool where he used to skate; there the sudden break in the lulls that gave the first view of the sea. He could not help springing up at the sight--pale, leaden, and misty as it was; and though Markham forthwith rebuked him for not listening, his heart was still beating as at the first sight of a dear old friend, when that peep was far behind. More black heaths, with stacks of peat and withered ferns. Guy was straining his eyes far off in the darkness to look for the smoke of the old keeper’s cottage chimney, and could with difficulty refrain from interrupting Markham to ask after the old man.",be long green wooded valley hill shoot first woodcock be great stone break good knife fit geological research be pool use skate sudden break lull give first view sea help spring sight pale leaden misty rebuke listen heart beat first sight dear old friend peep more black heath stack peat wither fern guy strain eye darkness look smoke old keeper cottage chimney difficulty refrain interrupt ask old man 
64,"Another long hill, and then began a descent into a rich valley, beautiful fields of young wheat, reddish soil, full of fatness, large spreading trees with noble limbs, cottages, and cottage gardens, very unlike poor Coombe Prior; Markham’s house--a perfect little snuggery covered all over with choice climbing plants, the smart plastered doctor’s house, the Morville Arms, looking honest and venerable, the church, with its disproportionately high tower, the parsonage rather hidden behind it; and, on the opposite side of the road, the park-wall and the gate, where old Sarah stood, in an ecstasy of curtsies.",long hill begin descent rich valley beautiful field young wheat reddish soil full fatness large spread tree noble limb cottage cottage garden poor house perfect little snuggery cover choice climb plant smart plaster doctor house look honest venerable church high tower parsonage hide opposite side road park wall gate old stand ecstasy curtsy 
65,"Guy jumped out to meet her, and to spare Whiteface; for there was a sharp, steep bit of hill, rising from the lodge, trying to horses, in spite of the road being cut out in long spirals. On he ran, leaving the road to Markham, straight up the high, steep, slippery green slope. He came in sight at the great dark-red sandstone pile of building; but he passed it, and ran on to where the ground rose on one side of it still more abruptly, and at the highest point was suddenly broken away and cut off into a perpendicular crag, descending in some parts sheer down to the sea, in others a little broken, and giving space for the growth of stunted brushwood. He stood at the highest point, where the precipice was most abrupt. The sea was dashing far beneath; the ripple, dash, and roar were in his ears once more; the wind--such wind as only blows over the sea--was breathing on his face; the broad, free horizon far before him; the field of waves, in gray and brown shade indeed, but still his own beloved waves; the bay, shut in with rocks, and with Black Shag Island and its train of rocks projecting far out to the west, and almost immediately beneath him, to the left, the little steep street of the fishing part of the village, nestled into the cove, which was formed by the mouth of a little mountain-stream, and the dozen boats it could muster rocking on the water.",guy jump meet spare be sharp steep bit hill rise lodge try horse spite road cut long spiral run leave road high steep slippery green slope come sight great dark red sandstone pile building pass run ground rise side high point break cut perpendicular crag descend part sheer sea other little break give space growth stunt brushwood stand high point precipice abrupt sea dash ripple dash roar ear more wind such wind blow sea breathe face broad free horizon field wave gray brown shade own beloved wave bay shut rock black train rock project west left little steep street fishing part village nestle cove form mouth little mountain stream boat muster rock water 
66,"Guy stood and looked as if he could never cease looking, or enjoying the sea air and salt breeze. It was real pleasure at first, for there were his home, his friends, and though there was a throb and tightness of heart at thinking how all was changed but such as this, and how all must change; how he had talked with Amy of this very thing, and had longed to have her standing beside him there; yet there was more of soothing than suffering in the sensation.",guy stand look cease look enjoy sea air salt breeze real pleasure be home friend be throb tightness heart think change such change talk very thing long have stand be more soothing suffer sensation

68,"The servants were indeed few. There was, alas! William of Deloraine, waiting to hold Whiteface; there was Arnaud, an old Swiss, first courier and then butler to old Sir Guy; there was Mrs. Drew, the housekeeper, also a very old servant; and these were all; but their welcome was of the heartiest, in feeling, if not in demonstration as the gig went with an echoing, thundering sound under the deep archway that led into the paved quadrangle; round which the house was built, that court where, as Philip had truly averred, the sun hardly ever shone, so high were the walls on each side.",servant few be wait hold be old swiss first courier butler old be housekeeper old servant welcome hearty feeling demonstration gig go echoing thunder sound deep archway lead paved quadrangle house build court averr sun shine high wall side 
69,"Up the stone steps into the spacious dark hall, and into the large, gloomy library, partially lighted by a great wood fire, replying to Mrs. Drew’s questions about his dinner and his room, and asking Markham to stay and dine with him, Guy at length found himself at home, in the very room where he had spent every evening of his boyhood, with the same green leather arm-chair, in the very place where his grandfather used to sit.",stone step spacious dark hall large gloomy library light great wood fire reply question dinner room ask stay dine length find home very room spend evening boyhood same green leather arm chair very place grandfather use sit 
70,"Markham consented to dine with him, and the evening was spent in talking over the news of Redclyffe. Markham spoke with much bitterness of the way in which Captain Morville had taken upon him; his looking into the accounts, though any one was welcome to examine them, was, he thought, scarcely becoming in so young a man--the heir-at-law, too.",consent dine evening spend talk news speak much bitterness way take look account one welcome examine think become young man heir law

75,"Mr. Bernard, the former clergyman, had been a quiet, old-fashioned man, very kind-hearted, but not at all active, and things had gone on in a sleepy, droning, matter-of-fact way, which Markham being used to, thought exactly what ought to be. Now, Mr. Ashford was an energetic person, desirous to do his utmost for the parish, and whatever he did was an offence to Markham, from the daily service, to the objecting to the men going out fishing on Sunday. He opposed every innovation with all his might, and Captain Morville’s interference, which had borne Markham down with Mr. Edmonstone’s authority, had only made him more determined not to bate an inch. He growled every time Guy was inclined to believe Mr. Ashford in the right, and brought out some fresh complaint. The grand controversy was at present about the school. There was a dame’s school in the cove or fishing part of the parish, maintained at the expense of the estate, in a small cottage far from the church, and Mr. and Mrs. Ashford had fixed their eyes on a house in the village, and so near the church as to be very convenient for a Sunday School. It only wanted to be floored, and to have a partition taken down, but to this Markham would not consent, treating it as a monstrous proposal to take away the school from old Jenny Robinson.",former clergyman quiet old fashioned man kind hearted active thing go sleepy dron matter fact way use think energetic person desirous do utmost parish do offence daily service objecting man go fishing oppose innovation interference borne authority make determined bate inch growl time inclined believe right bring fresh complaint grand controversy present school be dame school cove fishing part parish maintain expense estate small cottage church fix eye house village church convenient want floor have partition take consent treat monstrous proposal take school old

85,"Grunt, grunt; but though a very unbending viceroy, a must from the reigning baronet had a potent effect on Markham, whether it was for good or evil. He might grumble, but he never disobeyed, and the boy he was used to scold and order had found that Morville intonation of the must, which took away all idea of resistance.

89,"All the evening he had much to occupy him, and the dreaded sense of solitude and bereavement did not come on till he had parted with Markham, and stood alone before the fire in the large, gloomy room, where the light of the lamp seemed absorbed in the darkness of the distant corners, and where he had scarcely been since the moment when he found his grandfather senseless in that very chair. How different had that room once been in his eyes, when his happy spirits defied every association of gloom, and the bookshelves, the carved chairs, the heavy dark-green curtains and deep windows were connected with merry freaks, earnest researches, delightful achievements or discoveries! How long ago that time seemed! and how changed was he!",evening have much occupy dread sense solitude bereavement come part stand fire large gloomy room light lamp seem absorb darkness distant corner moment find grandfather senseless very chair different room eye happy spirit defy association gloom bookshelve carve chair heavy dark green curtain deep window connect merry freak earnest researche delightful achievement discovery time seem change 
90,"There was a certain tendency to melancholy in Guy’s mind. High spirits, prosperity, and self-discipline, had kept it from developing itself until the beginning of his troubles, but since that time it had been gradually gaining ground, and this was a time of great suffering, as he stood alone in his forefathers’ house, and felt himself, in his early youth, a doomed man, destined to bear the penalty of their crimes in the ruin of his dearest hopes, as if his heirloom of misery had but waited to seize on him till the very moment when it would give him the most to endure.",be certain tendency melancholy mind high spirit prosperity self discipline keep develop beginning trouble time gain ground time great suffering stand forefather house feel early youth doom man destine bear penalty crime ruin dearest hope heirloom misery have wait seize very moment give most endure 
91,"‘But bear it, I must and will!’ said he, lifting his head from the carved chimney-piece, where he had been resting it. ‘I have been in will a murderer myself, and what right have I to repine like the Israelites, with their self-justifying proverb? No; let me be thankful that I was not given up even then, but have been able to repent, and do a little better next time. It will be a blessing as yet ungranted to any of us, if indeed I should bear to the full the doom of sorrow, so that it may be vouchsafed me only to avoid actual guilt. Yes, Amy, your words are still with me--“Sintram conquered his doom,”--and it was by following death!

92,"With the energy of freshened resolution, he lighted his candle, and walked, with echoing steps, up the black oak staircase, along the broad gallery, up another flight, down another passage, to his own room. He had expressly written ‘his own room,’ and confirmed it on his arrival, or Mrs. Drew would have lodged him as she thought more suitably for the master of the house. Nothing had been done to alter its old familiar aspect, except lighting a fire, which he had never seen there before.
