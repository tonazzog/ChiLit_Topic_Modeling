1,CHAPTER 7. The Siege Of Arcot.,chapter 
2," From Conjeveram to Arcot is twenty-seven miles, and the troops, in spite of a delay caused by a tremendous storm of thunder and lightning, reached the town in two days. The garrison, struck with panic at the sudden coming of a foe, when they deemed themselves in absolute security, at once abandoned the fort, which they might easily have maintained until Chunda Sahib was able to send a force to relieve it. The city was incapable of defence after the fort had been abandoned, and Clive took possession of both, without firing a shot.",mile troops spite delay cause tremendous storm thunder lightning reach town day garrison strike panic sudden coming foe deem absolute security abandon fort maintain able send force relieve city incapable defence fort abandon take possession fire shot 
3,"He at once set to work to store up provisions in the fort, in which he found eight guns and an abundance of ammunition, as he foresaw the likelihood of his having to stand a siege there; and then, leaving a garrison to defend it in his absence, marched on the 4th of September with the rest of his forces against the enemy, who had retired from the town to the mud fort of Timari, six miles south of Arcot. After a few discharges with their cannon they retired hastily, and Clive marched back to Arcot.",set work store provision fort find gun abundance ammunition foresee likelihood have stand siege leave garrison defend absence march 4th rest force enemy retire town mud fort mile few discharge cannon retire march 
4,"Two days later, however, he found that they had been reinforced, and as their position threatened his line of communications, he again advanced towards them. He found the enemy about two thousand strong, drawn up in a grove under cover of the guns of the fort. The grove was inclosed by a bank and ditch, and some fifty yards away was a dry tank, inclosed by a bank higher than that which surrounded the grove. In this the enemy could retire, when dislodged from their first position.",day find reinforce position threaten line communication advance find enemy strong draw grove cover gun fort grove inclose bank ditch yard dry tank inclose bank high surround grove enemy retire dislodg first position 
5,"Charlie's heart beat fast when he heard the order given to advance. The enemy outnumbered them by five to one, and were in a strong position. As the English advanced, the enemy's two field pieces opened upon them. Only three men were killed, and, led by their officers, the men went at the grove at the double. The enemy at once evacuated it, and took refuge in the tank, from behind whose high bank they opened fire upon the English.",heart beat hear order give advance enemy outnumber strong position advance enemy field piece open man kill lead officer man go grove double enemy evacuate take refuge tank high bank open fire 
6,"Clive at once divided his men into two columns, and sent them round to attack the tank upon two sides. The movement was completely successful. At the same moment the men went with a rush at the banks, and upon reaching the top opened a heavy fire upon the crowded mass within. These at once fled in disorder.",divide man column send attack tank side movement successful same moment man go rush bank reach top open heavy fire crowded mass flead disorder 
7,"Clive then summoned the fort to surrender; but the commander, seeing that Clive had no battering train, refused to do so; and Clive fell back upon Arcot again, until his eighteen-pounders should arrive.",summon fort surrender commander see have battering train refuse do fall pounder arrive 
8,"For the next eight days, the troops were engaged in throwing up defences, and strengthening and victualling the fort. The enemy, gaining confidence, gathered to the number of three thousand, and encamped three miles from the town, proclaiming that they were about to besiege; and at midnight on the 14th Clive sallied out, took them by surprise, and dispersed them.",next day troops engage throw defence strengthen victuall fort enemy gain confidence gather number encamp mile town proclaim about besiege midnight 14th sall take surprise disperse 
9,"The two eighteen-pounders, for which Clive had sent to Madras, were now well upon the road, under the protection of a small body of Sepoys, and were approaching Conjeveram. The enemy sent a considerable body of troops to cut off the guns, and Clive found that the small number which he had sent out, to meet the approaching party, would not be sufficient. He therefore resolved to take the whole force, leaving only sufficient to garrison the fort.",pounder send road protection small body approach enemy send considerable body troops cut gun find small number send meet approach party sufficient resolve take whole force leave sufficient garrison fort 
10,"The post which the enemy occupied was a temple near Conjeveram, and as this was twenty-seven miles distant, the force would be obliged to be absent for at least two days. As it would probably be attacked, and might have to fight hard, he decided on leaving only thirty Europeans and fifty Sepoys within the fort. He appointed Doctor Rae to the command of the post during his absence, and placed Charlie and Peters under his orders.",post enemy occupy temple mile distant force oblige absent least day attack have fight decide leave sepoy fort appoint command post absence place order 
11,"""I wonder whether they will have any fighting,"" Charlie said, as the three officers looked from the walls of the fort after the departing force.",wonder have fighting say officer look wall fort depart force 
12,"""I wish we had gone with them,"" Peters put in; ""but it will be a long march, in the heat.""",wish go put long march heat 
13,"""I should think,"" Doctor Rae said, ""that they are sure to have fighting. I only hope they may not be attacked at night. The men are very young and inexperienced, and there is nothing tries new soldiers so much as a night attack. However, from what I hear of their own wars, I believe that night attacks are rare among them. I don't know that they have any superstition on the subject, as some African people have, on the ground that evil spirits are about at night; but the natives are certainly not brisk, after nightfall. They are extremely susceptible to any fall of temperature, and as you have, of course, noticed, sleep with their heads covered completely up. However, we must keep a sharp lookout here, tonight.""",think say sure have fighting hope attack night man young inexperienced be try new soldier much night attack hear own war believe night attack rare know have superstition subject african person ground evil spirit night native brisk nightfall susceptible fall temperature have course notice sleep head cover keep sharp lookout tonight 
14,"""You don't think that we are likely to be attacked, sir, do you?""",think likely attack sir 
15,"""It is possible we may be,"" the doctor said. ""They will know that Captain Clive has set out from here, with the main body, and has left only a small garrison. Of course they have spies, and will know that there are only eighty men here, a number insufficient to defend one side of this fort, to say nothing of the whole circle of the walls. They have already found out that the English can fight in the open, and their experience at Timari will make them shy of meeting us again. Therefore, it is just possible that they may be marching in this direction today, while Clive is going in the other, and that they may intend carrying it with a rush.",possible doctor say know set main body leave small garrison course have spy know be man number insufficient defend side fort say whole circle wall find fight open experience make shy meet possible march direction today go other intend carry rush 
16,"""I should say, today let the men repose as much as possible; keep the sentries on the gates and walls, but otherwise let them all have absolute quiet. You can tell the whites, and I will let the Sepoys know, that they will have to be in readiness all night, and that they had better, therefore, sleep as much as possible today. We will take it by turns to be on duty, one going round the walls and seeing that the sentries are vigilant, while the others sit in the shade and doze off, if they can. We must all three keep on the alert, during the night.""",say today let man repose much possible keep sentry gate wall let have absolute quiet tell white let sepoy know have readiness night have good sleep possible today take turn duty go wall see sentry vigilant other sit shade do keep alert night 
17,"Doctor Rae said that he, himself, would see that all went well for the first four hours, after which Charlie should go on duty; and the two subalterns accordingly made themselves as comfortable as they could in their quarters, which were high up in the fort, and possessed a window looking over the surrounding country.",say see go first hour go duty subaltern make comfortable quarter high fort possess window look surround country 
18,"""Well, Tim, what is the matter with you?"" they asked that soldier, as he came in with an earthenware jar of water, which he placed to cool in the window. ""You look pale.""",matter ask soldier come earthenware jar water place cool window look pale 
19,"""And it's pale I feel, your honor, with the life frightened fairly out of me, a dozen times a day. It was bad enough on the march, but this place just swarms with horrible reptiles. Shure an' it's a pity that the holy Saint Patrick didn't find time to pay a visit to India. If he'd driven the varmint into the sea for them, as he did in Ireland, the whole population would have become Christians, out of pure gratitude. Why, yer honor, in the cracks and crevices of the stones of this ould place there are bushels and bushels of 'em. There are things they call centipades, with a million legs on each side of them, and horns big enough to frighten ye; of all sizes up to as long as my hand and as thick as my finger; and they say that a bite from one of them will put a man in a raging fever, and maybe kill him. Then there are scorpions, the savagest looking little bastes ye ever saw, for all the world like a little lobster with his tail turned over his back, and a sting at the end of it. Then there's spiders, some of 'em nigh as big as a cat.""",pale feel honor life frighten time day bad march place swarm horrible reptile pity holy find time pay visit drive varmint sea whole population become pure gratitude honor crack crevice stone would place be bushel bushel be thing call centipade leg side horn big frighten size hand thick finger say bite put man rage fever kill be scorpion savagest look little baste see world little lobster tail turn back sting end be spider nigh big cat

21,"""It isn't their body, yer honor. It's their legs. They're just cruel to look at. It was one of 'em that gave me a turn, a while ago. I was just lying on my bed smoking my pipe, when I saw one of the creatures (as big as a saucer, I'll take my oath) walking towards me with his wicked eye fixed full on me. I jumped off the bed and on to a bench that stood handy.",body honor leg cruel look give turn while lie bed smoke pipe see creature big saucer take oath walk wicked eye fix full jump bed bench stand handy

26,"""So the corporal tells Pat Murphy, my right-hand man, to tackle the baste. I could see Pat didn't like the job ayther, yer honor, but he's not the boy to shrink from his duty; so he comes and he takes post on the form by my side, and just when the cratur is making up his mind to charge us both, Pat jumps down upon him and squelched it.",corporal tell right hand man tackle baste see like job honor boy shrink duty come take post form side cratur make mind charge jump squelch

29,"""The saints defind us, yer honor! I'd as soon think of taking a tiger by the tail.

30,"""And do ye know, yer honor, when I went out into the town yesterday, what should I see but a man sitting down against a wall, with a little bit of a flute in his hand, and a basket by his side. Well, yer honor, I thought maybe he was going to play a tune, when he lifts up the top of the basket and then began to play. Ye may call it music, yer honor, but there was nayther tune nor music in it.",know honor go town yesterday see man sit wall little bit flute hand basket side honor think go play tune lift top basket begin play call music honor be nayther tune music

34,"""There was nothing to be frightened at, Tim,"" Charlie said. ""It was a snake charmer. I have never seen one yet, but there are numbers of them all over India. Those were not ears you saw, but the hood. The snakes like the music, and wave their heads about in time to it. I believe that, although they are a very poisonous snake and their bite is certain death, there is no need to be afraid of them, as the charmers draw out their poison fangs when they catch them.""",be frighten say snake charmer see be number ear see hood snake music wave head time believe poisonous snake bite certain death be need afraid charmer draw poison fang catch 
35,"""Do they, now?"" Tim said, in admiration. ""I wonder what the regimental barber would say to a job like that, now. He well nigh broke Dan Sullivan's jaw, yesterday, in getting out a big tooth; and then swore at the poor boy, for having such a powerful strong jaw. I should like to see his face, if he was asked to pull out a tooth from one of them dancing sarpents.",say admiration wonder regimental barber say job break jaw yesterday get big tooth swore poor boy have powerful strong jaw like see face ask pull tooth dance sarpent 
36,"""I brought ye in some fruits, yer honors. I don't know what they are, but you may trust me, they're not poison.

So then I judged that they were safe for yer honors.""",bring fruit honor know trust poison stop hour stall see person country buy ate judge safe honor

38,"The first part of the night passed quietly. Double sentries were placed at each of the angles of the walls. The cannons were loaded, and all ready for instant action. Doctor Rae and his two subalterns were upon the alert, visiting the posts every quarter of an hour to see that the men were vigilant.",first part night pass double sentry place angle wall cannon load ready instant action subaltern alert visit post quarter hour see man vigilant 
39,"Towards two o'clock a dull sound was heard and, although nothing could be seen, the men were at once called to arms, and took up the posts to which they had already been told off on the walls. The noise continued. It was slight and confused, but the natives are so quiet in their movements, that the doctor did not doubt that a considerable body of men were surrounding the place, and that he was about to be attacked.",o'clock dull sound hear see man call arm take post tell wall noise continue slight confused native quiet movement doctor doubt considerable body man surround place about attack 
40,"Presently one of the sentries over the gateway perceived something approaching. He challenged, and immediately afterwards fired. The sound of his gun seemed to serve as the signal for an assault, and a large body of men rushed forward at the gate, while at two other points a force ran up to the foot of the walls, and endeavoured to plant ladders.",sentry gateway perceive approach challenge fire sound gun seem serve signal assault large body man rush gate other point force run foot wall endeavour plant ladder 
41,"The garrison at once collected at the points of attack, a few sentries only being left at intervals on the wall, to give notice should any attempt be made elsewhere. From the walls, a heavy fire of musketry was poured upon the masses below; while from the windows of all the houses around, answering flashes of fire shot out, a rain of bullets being directed at the battlements. Doctor Rae himself commanded at the gate; one of the subalterns at each of the other points assailed.",garrison collect point attack few sentry leave interval wall give notice attempt make wall heavy fire musketry pour mass window house answer flash fire shoot rain bullet direct battlement command gate subaltern other point assail 
42,"The enemy fought with great determination. Several times the ladders were planted and the men swarmed up them, but as often these were hurled back upon the crowd below. At the gate the assailants endeavoured to hew their way, with axes, through it; but so steady was the fire directed, from the loopholes which commanded it, upon those so engaged, that they were, each time, forced to recoil with great slaughter. It was not until nearly daybreak that the attack ceased, and the assailants, finding that they could not carry the place by a coup de main, fell back.",enemy fight great determination several time ladder plant man swarm hurl crowd gate assailant endeavour hew way axe steady fire direct loophole command engage time force recoil great slaughter daybreak attack cease assailant find carry place coup main fall 
43,"The next day, the main body of the British force returned with the convoy. News arrived, the following day, that the enemy were approaching to lay siege to the place.",next day main body british force return convoy news arrive follow day enemy approach lay siege place 
44,"The news of the capture of Arcot had produced the effect which Clive had anticipated from it. It alarmed and irritated the besiegers of Trichinopoli, and inspired the besieged with hope and exultation. The Mahratta chief of Gutti and the Rajah of Mysore, with whom Muhammud Ali had for some time been negotiating, at once declared in his favour. The Rajah of Tanjore and the chief of Pudicota, adjoining that state, who had hitherto remained strictly neutral, now threw in their fortunes with the English, and thereby secured the communications between Trichinopoli and the coast.",news capture produce effect anticipate alarm irritate besieger inspire besiege hope exultation chief time negotiate declare favour chief adjoin state remain neutral throw fortune secure communication coast 
45,"Chunda Sahib determined to lose not a moment in recovering Arcot, knowing that its recapture would at once cool the ardour of the new native allies of the English; and that, with its capture, the last hope of the besieged in Trichinopoli would be at an end. Continuing the siege, he despatched three thousand of his best troops, with a hundred and fifty Frenchmen, to reinforce the two thousand men already near Arcot, under the command of his son Riza Sahib. Thus the force about to attack Arcot amounted to five thousand men; while the garrison under Clive's orders had, by the losses in the defence of the fort, by fever and disease, been reduced to one hundred and twenty Europeans, and two hundred Sepoys; while four out of the eight officers were hors de combat.",determine lose moment recover know recapture cool ardour new native ally capture last hope besiege end continue siege despatch good troops reinforce man command son force attack amount man garrison order loss defence fort fever disease reduce sepoy officer hor combat 
46,"The fort which this handful of men had to defend was in no way capable of offering a prolonged resistance. Its walls were more than a mile in circumference, and were in a very bad state of repair. The rampart was narrow and the parapet low, and the ditch, in many places, dry. The fort had two gates. These were in towers standing beyond the ditch, and connected with the interior by a causeway across it. The houses in the town in many places came close up to the walls, and from their roofs the ramparts of the forts were commanded.",handful man have defend way capable offer prolonged resistance wall more mile circumference bad state repair rampart narrow parapet low ditch many place dry have gate tower stand ditch connect interior causeway house town many place come wall roof rampart fort command 
47,"On the 23rd September Riza Sahib, with his army, took up his position before Arcot. Their guns had not, however, arrived, with the exception of four mortars; but they at once occupied all the houses near the fort, and from the walls and upper windows kept up a heavy fire on the besieged.",23rd army take position gun arrive exception mortar occupy house fort wall upper window keep heavy fire besiege 
48,"Clive determined to make an effort, at once, to drive them from this position, and he accordingly, on the same afternoon, made a sortie. So deadly a fire, however, was poured into the troops as they advanced, that they were unable to make any way, and were forced to retreat into the fort again, after suffering heavy loss.",determine make effort drive position same afternoon make sortie deadly fire pour troops advance unable make way force retreat fort suffer heavy loss 
49,"On the night of the 24th, Charlie Marryat, with twenty men carrying powder, was lowered from the walls; and an attempt was made to blow up the houses nearest to them; but little damage was done, for the enemy were on the alert, and they were unable to place the powder in effective positions, and with a loss of ten of their number the survivors with difficulty regained the fort.",night 24th man carry powder lower wall attempt make blow house near little damage do enemy alert unable place powder effective position loss number survivor difficulty regain fort 
50,"For the next three weeks the position remained unchanged. So heavy was the fire which the enemy, from their commanding position, maintained, that no one could show his head for a moment, without running the risk of being shot. Only a few sentinels were kept upon the walls, to prevent the risk of surprise, and these had to remain stooping below the parapet. Every day added to the losses.",next week position remain unchanged heavy fire enemy commanding position maintain show head moment run risk shoot few sentinel keep wall prevent risk surprise have remain stoop parapet day add loss 
51,"Captain Clive had a series of wonderful escapes, and indeed the men began to regard him with a sort of superstitious reverence, believing that he had a charmed life. One of his three remaining officers, seeing an enemy taking deliberate aim at him through a window, endeavoured to pull him aside. The native changed his aim, and the officer fell dead. On three other occasions sergeants, who accompanied him on his rounds, were shot dead by his side. Yet no ball touched him.",have series wonderful escape man begin regard sort superstitious reverence believe have charm life remain officer see enemy take deliberate aim window endeavour pull native change aim officer fall dead other occasion sergeant accompany round shoot dead side ball touch 
52,"Provisions had been stored in the fort, before the commencement of the siege, sufficient for sixty days; and of this a third was already exhausted when, on the 14th of October, the French troops serving with Riza Sahib received two eighteen-pounders, and seven smaller pieces of artillery. Hitherto the besiegers had contented themselves with harassing the garrison night and day, abstaining from any attack which would cost them lives, until the arrival of their guns. Upon receiving these, they at once placed them in a battery which they had prepared on the northwest of the fort, and opened fire.",provision store fort commencement siege sufficient day third exhaust 14th french troops serve receive pounder small piece artillery besieger content harass garrison night day abstain attack cost life arrival gun receive place battery prepare northwest fort open fire 
53,"So well was this battery placed, and so accurate the aim of its gunner, that the very first shot dismounted one of the eighteen-pounders in the fort. The second again struck the gun and completely disabled it. The besieged mounted their second heavy gun in its place, and were preparing to open fire on the French battery, when a shot struck it also and dismounted it. It was useless to attempt to replace it, and it was, during the night, removed to a portion of the walls not exposed to the fire of the enemy's battery. The besiegers continued their fire, and in six days had demolished the wall facing their battery, making a breach of fifty feet wide.",battery place accurate aim gunner very first shot dismount pounder fort second strike gun disabled besiege mount second heavy gun place prepare open fire french battery shot strike dismount useless attempt replace night remove portion wall expose fire enemy battery besieger continue fire day demolish wall face battery make breach foot 
54,"Clive, who had now only the two young subalterns serving under him, worked indefatigably. His coolness and confidence of bearing kept up the courage of his little garrison, and every night, when darkness hid them from the view of the enemy's sharpshooters, the men laboured to prepare for the impending attack. Works were thrown up inside the fort, to command the breach. Two deep trenches were dug, one behind the other; the one close to the wall, the other some distance farther back. These trenches were filled with sharp iron three-pointed spikes, and palisades erected extending from the ends of the ditches to the ramparts, and a house pulled down in the rear to the height of a breastwork, behind which the garrison could fire at the assailants, as they endeavoured to cross the ditches.",young subaltern serve work coolness confidence bear keep courage little garrison night darkness hide view enemy sharpshooter man laboure prepare impending attack works throw fort command breach deep trenche dig other one close wall other distance trenche fill sharp iron point spike palisadd erect extend end ditch rampart house pull rear height breastwork garrison fire assailant endeavour cross ditch 
55,"One of the three field pieces Clive had brought with him he mounted on a tower, flanking the breach outside. Two he held in reserve, and placed two small guns, which he had found in the fort when he took it, on the flat roof of a house in the fort commanding the inside of the breach.",field piece bring mount tower flank breach hold reserve place small gun find fort take flat roof house fort commanding inside breach 
56,"From the roofs of some of the houses around the fort the besiegers beheld the progress of these defences; and Riza Sahib feared, in spite of his enormously superior numbers, to run the risk of a repulse. He knew that the amount of provisions which Clive had stored was not large, and thinking that famine would inevitably compel his surrender, shrank from incurring the risk of disheartening his army, by the slaughter which an unsuccessful attempt to carry the place must entail. He determined, at any rate, to increase the probability of success, and utilize his superior forces, by making an assault at two points, simultaneously. He therefore erected a battery on the southwest, and began to effect a breach on that side, also.",roof house fort besieger beheld progress defence fear spite superior number run risk repulse know amount provision store large think famine compel surrender shrank incurr risk dishearten army slaughter unsuccessful attempt carry place entail determine rate increase probability success utilize superior force make assault point erect battery southwest begin effect breach side 
57,"Clive, on his part, had been busy endeavouring to obtain assistance. His native emissaries, penetrating the enemy's lines, carried the news of the situation of affairs in the fort to Madras, Fort Saint David, and Trichinopoli. At Madras a few fresh troops had arrived from England, and Mr. Saunders, feeling that Clive must be relieved at all cost, however defenceless the state of Madras might be, despatched, on the 20th of October, a hundred Europeans and a hundred Sepoys, under Lieutenant Innis. These, after three days' marching, arrived at Trivatoor, twenty-two miles from Arcot.",part busy endeavour obtain assistance native emissary penetrate enemy line carry news situation affair fort few fresh troops arrive feel relieve cost defenceless state despatch 20th sepoy day marching arrive mile 
58,"Riza Sahib had heard of his approach; and sent a large body of troops, with two guns, to attack him. The contest was too unequal. Had the British force been provided with field pieces, they might have gained the day; but, after fighting with great bravery, they were forced to fall back; with a loss of twenty English and two officers killed and many more wounded, while the Sepoys suffered equally severely.",hear approach send large body troops gun attack contest unequal british force provide field piece gain day fight great bravery force fall loss english officer kill many wound suffer 
59,"One of Clive's messengers reached Murari Reo, the Mahratta chief of Gutti. This man was a ferocious free-booting chief, daring and brave himself, and admiring those qualities in others. Hitherto, his alliance with Muhammud Ali was little more than nominal, for he had dreaded bringing upon himself the vengeance of Chunda Sahib and the French, whose ultimate success in the strife appeared certain. Clive's march upon Arcot, and the heroic defence which the handful of men there were opposing to overwhelming numbers, excited his highest admiration. As he afterwards said, he had never before believed that the English could fight, and when Clive's messenger reached him, he at once sent back a promise of assistance.",messenger reach chief man ferocious free booting chief dare brave admire quality other alliance little more nominal dread bring vengeance ultimate success strife appear certain march heroic defence handful man oppose overwhelming number excite high admiration say believe fight messenger reach send promise assistance 
60,"Riza Sahib learned, almost as soon as Clive himself, that the Mahrattas were on the move. The prospects of his communications being harassed, by these daring horsemen, filled him with anxiety. Murari Reo was encamped, with six thousand men, at a spot thirty miles to the west of Arcot; and he might, at any moment, swoop down upon the besiegers. Although, therefore, Riza Sahib had for six days been at work effecting a new breach, which was now nearly open to assault, he sent on the 30th of October a flag of truce, with an offer to Clive of terms, if he would surrender Arcot.",learn move prospect communication harass dare horsemen fill anxiety encamp man spot mile west moment swoop besieger have day work effect new breach open assault send 30th flag truce offer term surrender 
61,"The garrison were to be allowed to march out with their arms and baggage, while to Clive himself he offered a large sum of money. In case of refusal, he threatened to storm the fort, and put all its defenders to the sword. Clive returned a defiant refusal, and the guns again opened on the second breach.",garrison allow march arm baggage offer large sum money case refusal threaten storm fort put defender sword return defiant refusal gun open second breach 
62,"On the 9th of November, the Mahrattas began to show themselves in the neighbourhood of the besieging army. The force under Lieutenant Innis had been reinforced, and was now under the command of Captain Kilpatrick, who had a hundred and fifty English troops, with four field guns. This was now advancing.",9th begin show neighbourhood besieg army force reinforce command have english troops field gun advance 
63,"Four days later the new breach had attained a width of thirty yards, but Clive had prepared defences in the rear, similar to those at the other breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers would here be much greater, as the ditch was not fordable.",day new breach attain width yard prepare defence rear similar other breach difficulty besieger great ditch fordable 
64,"The fifty days which the siege had lasted had been terrible ones for the garrison. Never daring to expose themselves unnecessarily during the day, yet ever on the alert to repel an attack; labouring at night at the defences, with their numbers daily dwindling, and the prospect of an assault becoming more and more imminent, the work of the little garrison was terrible; and it is to the defences of Lucknow and Cawnpore, a hundred years later, that we must look to find a parallel, in English warfare, for their endurance and bravery.",day siege last terrible one garrison dare expose day alert repel attack labour night defence number dwindle prospect assault become imminent work little garrison terrible defence year look find parallel english warfare endurance bravery 
65,"Both Charlie Marryat and Peters had been wounded, but in neither case were the injuries severe enough to prevent their continuing on duty. Tim Kelly had his arm broken by a ball, while another bullet cut a deep seam along his cheek, and carried away a portion of his ear. With his arm in splints and a sling, and the side of his face covered with strappings and plaster, he still went about his business.",wound case injury severe prevent continue duty have arm break ball bullet cut deep seam cheek carry portion ear arm splint sling side face cover strapping plaster go business 
66,"""Ah! Yer honors,"" he said one day to his masters; ""I've often been out catching rabbits, with ferrits to drive 'em out of their holes, and sticks to knock 'em on the head, as soon as they showed themselves; and it's a divarshun I was always mightily fond of, but I never quite intered into the feelings of the rabbits. Now I understand them complately, for ain't we rabbits ourselves? The officers, saving your presence, are the ferrits who turn us out of our holes on duty; and the niggers yonder, with their muskets and their matchlocks, are the men with sticks, ready to knock us on head, directly we show ourselves.
