1,CHAPTER 7. THE BURGLARS,chapter 
2,"It was much too fine a night to think of going to bed at once, and so, although the witching hour of nine P.M. had struck, Edward and I were still leaning out of the open window in our nightshirts, watching the play of the cedar-branch shadows on the moonlit lawn, and planning schemes of fresh devilry for the sunshiny morrow. From below, strains of the jocund piano declared that the Olympians were enjoying themselves in their listless, impotent way; for the new curate had been bidden to dinner that night, and was at the moment unclerically proclaiming to all the world that he feared no foe. His discordant vociferations doubtless started a train of thought in Edward’s mind, for the youth presently remarked, a propos of nothing that had been said before, “I believe the new curate’s rather gone on Aunt Maria.”",fine night think go bed witching hour p.m. strike lean open window nightshirt watch play cedar branch shadow moonlit lawn plan scheme fresh devilry sunshiny morrow strain jocund piano declare enjoy listless impotent way new curate bidd dinner night moment proclaim world fear foe discordant vociferation start train thought mind youth remark propos say believe new curate gone 
3,"I scouted the notion. “Why, she’s quite old,” I said. (She must have seen some five-and-twenty summers.)",scout notion old say see summer 
4,"“Of course she is,” replied Edward, scornfully. “It’s not her, it’s her money he’s after, you bet!”",course reply money bet 
5,"“Didn’t know she had any money,” I observed timidly.",know have money observe 
6,"“Sure to have,” said my brother, with confidence. “Heaps and heaps.”",sure have say brother confidence heap heap 
7,"Silence ensued, both our minds being busy with the new situation thus presented,--mine, in wonderment at this flaw that so often declared itself in enviable natures of fullest endowment,--in a grown-up man and a good cricketer, for instance, even as this curate; Edward’s (apparently), in the consideration of how such a state of things, supposing it existed, could be best turned to his own advantage.",silence ensue mind busy new situation present wonderment flaw declare enviable nature full endowment grow man good cricketer instance curate consideration state thing suppose exist turn own advantage 
8,"“Bobby Ferris told me,” began Edward in due course, “that there was a fellow spooning his sister once--”",tell begin due course be fellow spoon sister 
9,“What’s spooning?” I asked meekly.,spoon ask 
10,"“Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, indifferently. “It’s--it’s--it’s just a thing they do, you know. And he used to carry notes and messages and things between ‘em, and he got a shilling almost every time.”",say thing do know use carry note message thing get shilling time 
11,"“What, from each of ‘em?” I innocently inquired.",inquire 
12,"Edward looked at me with scornful pity. “Girls never have any money,” he briefly explained. “But she did his exercises and got him out of rows, and told stories for him when he needed it--and much better ones than he could have made up for himself. Girls are useful in some ways. So he was living in clover, when unfortunately they went and quarrelled about something.”",look scornful pity girl have money explain do exercise get row tell story need good one make girl useful way live clover go quarrell 
13,"“Don’t see what that’s got to do with it,” I said.",see get do say 
14,"“Nor don’t I,” rejoined Edward. “But anyhow the notes and things stopped, and so did the shillings. Bobby was fairly cornered, for he had bought two ferrets on tick, and promised to pay a shilling a week, thinking the shillings were going on for ever, the silly young ass. So when the week was up, and he was being dunned for the shilling, he went off to the fellow and said, ‘Your broken-hearted Bella implores you to meet her at sundown,--by the hollow oak, as of old, be it only for a moment. Do not fail!’ He got all that out of some rotten book, of course. The fellow looked puzzled and said,--",rejoin note thing stop do shilling corner buy ferret tick promise pay shilling week think shilling go silly young ass week dunn shilling go fellow say broken hearted implore meet sundown hollow oak old moment fail get rotten book course fellow look puzzle say 
15,“‘What hollow oak? I don’t know any hollow oak.’,hollow oak know hollow oak 
16,"“‘Perhaps it was the Royal Oak?’ said Bobby promptly, ‘cos he saw he had made a slip, through trusting too much to the rotten book; but this didn’t seem to make the fellow any happier.”",royal say see make slip trust much rotten book seem make fellow happy 
17,"“Should think not,” I said, “the Royal Oak’s an awful low sort of pub.”",think say royal awful low sort pub 
18,"“I know,” said Edward. “Well, at last the fellow said, ‘I think I know what she means: the hollow tree in your father’s paddock. It happens to be an elm, but she wouldn’t know the difference. All right: say I’ll be there.’ Bobby hung about a bit, for he hadn’t got his money. ‘She was crying awfully,’ he said. Then he got his shilling.”",know say last fellow say think know mean hollow tree father paddock happen elm know difference right say hang bit get money cry say get shilling 
19,"“And wasn’t the fellow riled,” I inquired, “when he got to the place and found nothing?”",fellow rile inquire get place find 
20,"“He found Bobby,” said Edward, indignantly. “Young Ferris was a gentleman, every inch of him. He brought the fellow another message from Bella: ‘I dare not leave the house. My cruel parents immure me closely If you only knew what I suffer. Your broken-hearted Bella.’ Out of the same rotten book. This made the fellow a little suspicious, ‘cos it was the old Ferrises who had been keen about the thing all through: the fellow, you see, had tin.”",find say young gentleman inch bring fellow message leave house cruel parent immure know suffer break hearted same rotten book make fellow little suspicious old keen thing fellow see have tin 
21,“But what’s that got to--” I began again.,get begin 
22,"“Oh, _I_ dunno,” said Edward, impatiently. “I’m telling you just what Bobby told me. He got suspicious, anyhow, but he couldn’t exactly call Bella’s brother a liar, so Bobby escaped for the time. But when he was in a hole next week, over a stiff French exercise, and tried the same sort of game on his sister, she was too sharp for him, and he got caught out. Somehow women seem more mistrustful than men. They’re so beastly suspicious by nature, you know.”",say tell tell get suspicious call brother liar escape time hole next week stiff french exercise try same sort game sister sharp catch woman seem mistrustful man suspicious nature know 
23,"“_I_ know,” said I. “But did the two--the fellow and the sister--make it up afterwards?”",know say fellow sister make 
24,"“I don’t remember about that,” replied Edward, indifferently; “but Bobby got packed off to school a whole year earlier than his people meant to send him,--which was just what he wanted. So you see it all came right in the end!”",remember reply pack school whole year person mean send want see come end 
25,"I was trying to puzzle out the moral of this story--it was evidently meant to contain one somewhere--when a flood of golden lamplight mingled with the moon rays on the lawn, and Aunt Maria and the new curate strolled out on the grass below us, and took the direction of a garden seat that was backed by a dense laurel shrubbery reaching round in a half-circle to the house. Edward mediated moodily. “If we only knew what they were talking about,” said he, “you’d soon see whether I was right or not. Look here! Let’s send the kid down by the porch to reconnoitre!”",try puzzle moral story mean contain flood golden lamplight mingle moon ray lawn new curate stroll grass take direction garden seat back dense laurel shrubbery reach half circle house mediate know talk say see right look let send kid porch reconnoitre 
26,"“Harold’s asleep,” I said; “it seems rather a shame--”",asleep say seem shame 
27,"“Oh, rot!” said my brother; “he’s the youngest, and he’s got to do as he’s told!”",say brother young get do tell 
28,"So the luckless Harold was hauled out of bed and given his sailing-orders. He was naturally rather vexed at being stood up suddenly on the cold floor, and the job had no particular interest for him; but he was both staunch and well disciplined. The means of exit were simple enough. A porch of iron trellis came up to within easy reach of the window, and was habitually used by all three of us, when modestly anxious to avoid public notice. Harold climbed deftly down the porch like a white rat, and his night gown glimmered a moment on the gravel walk ere he was lost to sight in the darkness of the shrubbery. A brief interval of silence ensued, broken suddenly by a sound of scuffle, and then a shrill, long-drawn squeal, as of metallic surfaces in friction. Our scout had fallen into the hands of the enemy!",luckless haul bed give sailing order vex stand cold floor job have particular interest staunch disciplined means exit simple porch iron trellis come easy reach window use anxious avoid public notice climb porch white rat night gown glimmer moment gravel walk lose sight darkness shrubbery brief interval silence ensue break sound scuffle shrill long draw squeal metallic surface friction scout fall hand enemy 
29,"Indolence alone had made us devolve the task of investigation on our younger brother. Now that danger had declared itself, there was no hesitation. In a second we were down the side of the porch, and crawling Cherokee-wise through the laurels to the back of the garden-seat. Piteous was the sight that greeted us. Aunt Maria was on the seat, in a white evening frock, looking--for an aunt--really quite nice. On the lawn stood an incensed curate, grasping our small brother by a large ear, which--judging from the row he was making--seemed on the point of parting company with the head it adorned. The gruesome noise he was emitting did not really affect us otherwise than aesthetically. To one who has tried both, the wail of genuine physical anguish is easy distinguishable from the pumped-up ad misericordiam blubber. Harold’s could clearly be recognised as belonging to the latter class. “Now, you young--” (whelp, _I_ think it was, but Edward stoutly maintains it was devil), said the curate, sternly; “tell us what you mean by it!”",indolence make devolve task investigation young brother danger declare be hesitation second side porch crawl wise laurel back garden seat piteous sight greet seat white evening frock look aunt nice lawn stand incense curate grasp small brother large ear judge row make seem point part company head adorn gruesome noise emit affect try wail genuine physical anguish easy distinguishable pump ad misericordiam blubber recognise belong latter class young whelp think maintain say curate tell mean 
30,"“Well, leggo of my ear then!” shrilled Harold, “and I’ll tell you the solemn truth!”",leggo ear shrill tell solemn truth 
31,"“Very well,” agreed the curate, releasing him; “now go ahead, and don’t lie more than you can help.”",agree curate release go lie more help 
32,We abode the promised disclosure without the least misgiving; but even we had hardly given Harold due credit for his fertility of resource and powers of imagination.,abead promise disclosure least misgiving give due credit fertility resource power imagination 
33,"“I had just finished saying my prayers,” began that young gentleman, slowly, “when I happened to look out of the window, and on the lawn I saw a sight which froze the marrow in my veins! A burglar was approaching the house with snake-like tread! He had a scowl and a dark lantern, and he was armed to the teeth!”",finish say prayer begin young gentleman happen look window lawn see sight frize marrow vein burglar approach house snake tread have scowl dark lantern armed tooth 
34,"We listened with interest. The style, though unlike Harold’s native notes, seemed strangely familiar.",listen interest style native note seem familiar 
35,"“Go on,” said the curate, grimly.",go say curate 
36,"“Pausing in his stealthy career,” continued Harold, “he gave a low whistle. Instantly the signal was responded to, and from the adjacent shadows two more figures glided forth. The miscreants were both armed to the teeth.”",pause stealthy career continue give low whistle signal respond adjacent shadow more figure glide miscreant armed tooth 
37,"“Excellent,” said the curate; “proceed.”",excellent say curate proceed 
38,"“The robber chief,” pursued Harold, warming to his work, “joined his nefarious comrades, and conversed with them in silent tones. His expression was truly ferocious, and I ought to have said that he was armed to the t--”",robber chief pursue warm work join nefarious comrade convers silent tone expression ferocious say armed 
39,"“There, never mind his teeth,” interrupted the curate, rudely; “there’s too much jaw about you altogether. Hurry up and have done.”",mind tooth interrupt curate be much jaw hurry do 
40,"“I was in a frightful funk,” continued the narrator, warily guarding his ear with his hand, “but just then the drawing-room window opened, and you and Aunt Maria came out--I mean emerged. The burglars vanished silently into the laurels, with horrid implications!”",frightful funk continue narrator guard ear hand draw room window open come mean emerge burglar vanish laurel horrid implication 
41,"The curate looked slightly puzzled. The tale was well sustained, and certainly circumstantial. After all, the boy might have really seen something. How was the poor man to know--though the chaste and lofty diction might have supplied a hint--that the whole yarn was a free adaptation from the last Penny Dreadful lent us by the knife-and-boot boy?",curate look puzzled tale sustain circumstantial boy see poor man know chaste lofty diction supply hint whole yarn free adaptation last loan knife boot boy 
42,“Why did you not alarm the house?” he asked.,alarm house ask 
43,"“‘Cos I was afraid,” said Harold, sweetly, “that p’raps they mightn’t believe me!”",afraid say p’rap believe 
44,"“But how did you get down here, you naughty little boy?” put in Aunt Maria.",get naughty little boy put 
45,"Harold was hard pressed--by his own flesh and blood, too!",hard press own flesh blood 
46,"At that moment Edward touched me on the shoulder and glided off through the laurels. When some ten yards away he gave a low whistle. I replied by another. The effect was magical. Aunt Maria started up with a shriek. Harold gave one startled glance around, and then fled like a hare, made straight for the back door, burst in upon the servants at supper, and buried himself in the broad bosom of the cook, his special ally. The curate faced the laurels--hesitatingly. But Aunt Maria flung herself on him. “O Mr. Hodgitts!” I heard her cry, “you are brave! for my sake do not be rash!” He was not rash. When I peeped out a second later, the coast was entirely clear.",moment touch shoulder glide laurel yard give low whistle reply effect magical start shriek give startle glance flead hare make back door burst servant supper bury broad bosom cook special ally curate face laurel flung hear cry brave sake rash rash peep second coast clear 
47,"By this time there were sounds of a household timidly emerging; and Edward remarked to me that perhaps we had better be off. Retreat was an easy matter. A stunted laurel gave a leg up on to the garden wall, which led in its turn to the roof of an out-house, up which, at a dubious angle, we could crawl to the window of the box-room. This overland route had been revealed to us one day by the domestic cat, when hard pressed in the course of an otter-hunt, in which the cat--somewhat unwillingly--was filling the title role; and it had proved distinctly useful on occasions like the present. We were snug in bed--minus some cuticle from knees and elbows--and Harold, sleepily chewing something sticky, had been carried up in the arms of the friendly cook, ere the clamour of the burglar-hunters had died away.",time be sound household emerge remark retreat easy matter stunt laurel give leg garden wall lead turn roof house dubious angle crawl window box room overland route reveal day domestic cat press course otter hunt cat fill title role prove useful occasion present snug bed cuticle knee elbow chew sticky carry arm friendly cook clamour burglar hunter die 
48,"The curate’s undaunted demeanour, as reported by Aunt Maria, was generally supposed to have terrified the burglars into flight, and much kudos accrued to him thereby. Some days later, however, when he hid dropped in to afternoon tea, and was making a mild curatorial joke about the moral courage required for taking the last piece of bread-and-butter, I felt constrained to remark dreamily, and as it were to the universe at large, “Mr. Hodgitts! you are brave! for my sake, do not be rash!”",curate undaunted demeanour report suppose terrify burglar flight much kudo accrue day drop afternoon tea make mild curatorial joke moral courage require take last piece bread butter feel constrain remark universe large brave sake rash
