1,CHAPTER 2. THE SHADOW,chapter 
2,"Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.",scream answer bell door open enter return evening growl spring boy leapt window scream time distress think kill run street look little body look black night see think shooting star 
3,"She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.",return nursery find mouth prove boy shadow leapt window close late catch shadow have time get slam go window snap 
4,"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.",sure examine shadow ordinary kind 
5,"Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let us put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”",have doubt good thing do shadow hang window mean sure come let put get disturbing child 
6,"But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.”",leave hang window look washing lower whole tone house think show tot winter great coat wet towel head keep brain clear seem shame trouble know say come have dog nurse 
7,"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!",decide roll shadow put drawer fitting opportunity come tell husband 
8,"The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Of course it was a Friday.",opportunity come week forget course 
9,"“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her, holding her hand.",careful use say husband other side hold hand 
10,"“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I, George Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA.” He had had a classical education.",say responsible do have classical education 
11,"They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like the faces on a bad coinage.",sit night night recall fatal detail stamp brain come other side face bad coinage 
12,"“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs. Darling said.",accept invitation dine say 
13,"“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr. Darling.",pour medicine bowl say 
14,"“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet eyes said.",pretend like medicine wet eye say 
15,"“My liking for parties, George.”",like party 
16,"“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”",fatal gift humour dearest 
17,"“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”",touchiness trifle dear master mistress 
18,"Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for a nurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana’s eyes.",more break thought true true have dog nurse many time put handkerchief eye 
19,"“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the right-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.",fiend cry bark echo upbraid be right hand corner mouth want call name 
20,"They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.",sit empty nursery recall small detail dreadful evening begin other evening put water bath carry back 
21,"“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”",go bed shout believe have last word subject o'clock love more tell bath 
22,"Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.",come wear white evening gown dress love see evening gown necklace give wear bracelet arm ask loan love lend bracelet mother 
23,"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:",find old child play father occasion birth say 
24,"“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,”  in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real occasion.",happy inform mother tone use real occasion 
25,"Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.",dance joy real do 
26,"Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John said brutally that they did not want any more.",bear extra pomp conceive due birth male come bath ask bear say want more 
27,"Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.",cry want say course lady evening dress stand 
28,"“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”",say want third child 
29,"“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.",boy girl ask 
30,“Boy.”,boy 
31,"Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael’s last night in the nursery.",leapt arm little thing recall little last night nursery 
32,They go on with their recollections.,go recollection 
33,"“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.",rush tornado say scorn tornado 
34,"Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for the party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.",be excuse dress party go come tie astounding thing have tell man know stock share have real mastery tie thing yield contest be occasion good house swallow pride use make tie 
35,This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.,occasion come rush nursery crumple little brute tie hand 
36,"“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”",matter father dear 
37,"“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”",matter yell yell tie tie become sarcastic neck bed post time make bed post neck dear beg excuse 
38,"He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.”",think impressed go warn mother tie neck go dinner night go dinner night go office go office starve child flung street 
39,"Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.",placid let try dear say come ask do nice cool hand tie tie child stand see fate decide man resent able do have fine nature thank forget rage moment dance room back 
40,"“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.",romp say recall 
41,“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.,last romp groan 
42,"“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you get to know me, mother?’”",remember say get know mother 
43,“I remember!”,remember 
44,"“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”",sweet think 
45,"“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”",gone 
46,"The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.",romp end appearance collide cover trousers hair new trousers first have braid have bite lip prevent tear come course brush begin talk mistake have dog nurse 
47,"“George, Nana is a treasure.”",treasure 
48,"“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the children as puppies.”",doubt have uneasy feeling time look child puppy 
49,"“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”",dear one feel sure know have soul 
50,"“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the shadow.",wonder say wonder opportunity wife feel tell boy first pooh pooh story become thoughtful show shadow 
51,"“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does look a scoundrel.”",know say examine look scoundrel 
52,"“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”",discuss remember say come medicine carry bottle mouth fault 
53,"Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man, Michael.”",strong man be doubt behave medicine have weakness think life take medicine dodg spoon mouth say man 
54,"“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.",cry leave room get chocolate think show want firmness 
55,"“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”",mother pamper call age take medicine murmur say thank kind parent give bottle make 
56,"He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”",think true night gown believe say encourage medicine take father nasty 
57,"“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”",nasty say take example lose bottle 
58,"He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.",lose climb dead night top wardrobe hide know faithful find put wash stand 
59,"“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of service. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.",know father cry glad service bring stop spirit sink strangest way 
60,"“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.”",say shudder beastly stuff nasty sticky sweet kind 
61,"“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.",father say rush medicine glass 
62,"“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.",quick pant 
63,"“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a vindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael first,” he said doggedly.",quick father retort vindictive politeness throw say 
64,"“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.",father say suspicious nature 
65,"“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.",sick know say 
66,"“Come on, father,” said John.",come father say 
67,"“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.",hold tongue father rapp 
68,"Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”",puzzled think take father 
69,"“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my last breath; it isn’t fair.”",point retort point be more glass spoon proud heart burst fair say last breath fair 
70,"“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.",father wait say 
71,“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”,say wait wait 
72,“Father’s a cowardly custard.”,father cowardly custard 
73,“So are you a cowardly custard.”,cowardly custard 
74,“I’m not frightened.”,frighten 
75,“Neither am I frightened.”,frighten 
76,"“Well, then, take it.”",take 
77,"“Well, then, you take it.”",take 
78,Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”,have splendid idea take same time 
79,"“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”",say ready 
80,"Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.",give word take medicine slip back 
81,"There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.",be yell rage o father exclaim 
82,"“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I--I missed it.”",mean father demand stop row mean take miss 
83,"It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly, as soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a splendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will drink it, thinking it is milk!”",dreadful way look admire look say go bathroom think splendid joke pour medicine bowl drink think milk 
84,"It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s sense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.",colour milk child have father sense humour look pour medicine bowl fun say dare expose return 
85,"“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into your bowl, Nana.”",good dog say pat put little milk bowl 
86,"Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.",wagg tail run medicine begin lap give look angry look show great red tear make sorry noble dog creep kennel 
87,"Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she said, “it’s your medicine!”",ashamed give horrid silence smell bowl say medicine 
88,"“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”",joke roar comfort boy hugge good say wear bone try funny house 
89,"And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I be coddled--why, why, why!”",hugge right shout coddle coddle dear breadwinner coddle 
90,"“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the servants.",entreat loud servant hear get way call servant 
91,“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”,let answer bring whole world refuse allow dog lord nursery hour 
92,"The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried; “the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up this instant.”",child goot run wave feel strong man vain vain cry proper place yard go tie instant 
93,"“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you about that boy.”",whisper remember tell boy 
94,"Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in that house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.",listen determined show master house command draw kennel lure honeyed word seize drag nursery ashamed do ow affectionate nature crave admiration tie back yard wretched father go sit passage knuckle eye 
95,"In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but Wendy was wiser.",meantime put child bed unwonted silence light night light hear barking whimper chain yard wise 
96,"“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was about to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”",unhappy bark say little guess about happen bark smell danger 
97,Danger!,danger 
98,"“Are you sure, Wendy?”",sure 
99,"“Oh, yes.”",
100,"Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”",quiver go window fasten look night pepper star crowd house curious see take place notice small one wink nameless fear clutch heart make cry wish go party night 
101,"Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”",half asleep know perturb ask harm mother night light light 
102,"“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children.”",precious say eye mother leave guard child 
103,"She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of you.”  They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.",go bed bed sing enchantment little flung arm mother cry glad last word hear long time 
104,"No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out; but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:",no. few yard distant be slight fall snow pick way soil shoe only person street star watch star beautiful take active part look punishment put do star know old one become glassy eye speak winking star language little one wonder friendly have mischievous way steal try blow fond fun side night anxious get grow up way door close be commotion firmament small star milky scream
