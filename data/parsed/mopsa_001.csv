""'Tis thy world, 'tis my world,     City, mead, and shore,   For he that hath his own world     Hath many worlds more.""",own world tis gold snow save scarlet wave hurl yon gulf tis world world shore have own world many world 
3," A boy, whom I knew very well, was once going through a meadow, which was full of buttercups. The nurse and his baby sister were with him; and when they got to an old hawthorn, which grew in the hedge and was covered with blossom, they all sat down in its shade, and the nurse took out three slices of plum-cake, gave one to each of the children, and kept one for herself.",boy know go meadow full buttercup nurse baby sister get old hawthorn grow hedge cover blossom sit shade nurse take slice plum cake give child keep 
4,"While the boy was eating, he observed that this hedge was very high and thick, and that there was a great hollow in the trunk of the old thorn-tree, and he heard a twittering, as if there was a nest somewhere inside; so he thrust his head in, twisted himself round, and looked up.",boy eat observe hedge high thick be great hollow trunk old thorn tree hear twittering be nest thrust head twist look 
5,"It was a very great thorn-tree, and the hollow was so large that two or three boys could have stood upright in it; and when he got used to the dim light in that brown, still place, he saw that a good way above his head there was a nest,--rather a curious one, too, for it was as large as a pair of blackbirds would have built,--and yet it was made of fine white wool and delicate bits of moss; in short, it was like a goldfinch's nest magnified three times.",great thorn tree hollow large boy stand use dim light brown place see good way head be nest curious one large pair blackbird build make fine white wool delicate bit moss short goldfinch nest magnify time 
6,"Just then he thought he heard some little voices cry, ""Jack! Jack!"" His baby sister was asleep, and the nurse was reading a story-book, so it could not have been either of them who called. ""I must get in here,"" said the boy. ""I wish this hole was larger."" So he began to wriggle and twist himself through, and just as he pulled in his last foot, he looked up, and three heads which had been peeping over the edge of the nest suddenly popped down again.",think hear little voice cry baby sister asleep nurse read story book call get say boy wish hole large begin wriggle twist pull last foot look head peep edge nest pop 
7,"""Those heads had no beaks, I am sure,"" said Jack, and he stood on tiptoe and poked in one of his fingers. ""And the things have no feathers,"" he continued; so, the hollow being rather rugged, he managed to climb up and look in.",head have beak sure say stand tiptoe poke finger thing have feather continue hollow rugged manage climb look 
8,"His eyes were not used yet to the dim light; but he was sure those things were not birds,--no. He poked them, and they took no notice; but when he snatched one of them out of the nest, it gave a loud squeak, and said, ""O don't, Jack!"" as plainly as possible, upon which he was so frightened that he lost his footing, dropped the thing, and slipped down himself. Luckily, he was not hurt, nor the thing either; he could see it quite plainly now: it was creeping about like rather an old baby, and had on a little frock and pinafore.",eye use dim light sure thing bird poke take notice snatch nest give loud squeak say possible frighten lose footing drop thing slip hurt thing see creep old baby have little frock pinafore 
9,"""It's a fairy!"" exclaimed Jack to himself. ""How curious! and this must be a fairy's nest. Oh, how angry the old mother will be if this little thing creeps away and gets out of the hole!"" So he looked down. ""Oh, the hole is on the other side,"" he said; and he turned round, but the hole was not on the other side; it was not on any side; it must have closed up all on a sudden, while he was looking into the nest, for, look whichever way he would, there was no hole at all, excepting a very little one high up over the nest, which let in a very small sunbeam.",fairy exclaim curious fairy nest angry old mother little thing creep get hole look hole other side say turn hole other side side close sudden look nest look way be hole except little one high nest let small sunbeam 
10,"Jack was very much astonished, but he went on eating his cake, and was so delighted to see the young fairy climb up the side of the hollow and scramble again into her nest, that he laughed heartily; upon which all the nestlings popped up their heads, and, showing their pretty white teeth, pointed at the slice of cake.",astonished go eat cake delighted see young fairy climb side hollow scramble nest laugh nestling pop head show pretty white tooth point slice cake 
11,"""Well,"" said Jack, ""I may have to stay inside here for a long time, and I have nothing to eat but this cake; however, your mouths are very small, so you shall have a piece;"" and he broke off a small piece, and put it into the nest, climbing up to see them eat it.",say have stay long time have eat cake mouth small have piece break small piece put nest climb see eat 
12,"These young fairies were a long time dividing and munching the cake, and before they had finished, it began to be rather dark, for a black cloud came over and covered the little sunbeam. At the same time the wind rose, and rocked the boughs, and made the old tree creak and tremble. Then there was thunder and rain, and the little fairies were so frightened that they got out of the nest and crept into Jack's pockets. One got into each waistcoat pocket, and the other two were very comfortable, for he took out his handkerchief and made room for them in the pocket of his jacket.",young fairy long time divide munch cake finish begin dark black cloud come cover little sunbeam same time wind rise rock bough make old tree creak tremble be thunder rain little fairy frighten get nest creep pocket get waistcoat pocket other comfortable take handkerchief make room pocket jacket 
13,"It got darker and darker, till at last Jack could only just see the hole, and it seemed to be a very long way off. Every time he looked at it, it was farther off, and at last he saw a thin crescent moon shining through it.",get dark dark last see hole seem long way time look last see thin crescent moon shine 
14,"""I am sure it cannot be night yet,"" he said; and he took out one of the fattest of the young fairies, and held it up towards the hole.",sure night say take fattest young fairy hold hole 
15,"""Look at that,"" said he; ""what is to be done now? the hole is so far off that it's night up there, and down here I haven't done eating my lunch.""",look say do hole night do eat lunch 
16,"""Well,"" answered the young fairy, ""then why don't you whistle?""",answer young fairy whistle 
17,"Jack was surprised to hear her speak in this sensible manner, and in the light of the moon he looked at her very attentively.",surprise hear speak sensible manner light moon look 
18,"""When first I saw you in the nest,"" said he, ""you had a pinafore on, and now you have a smart little apron, with lace round it.""",see nest say have pinafore have smart little apron lace 
19,"""That is because I am much older now,"" said the fairy; ""we never take such a long time to grow up as you do.""",old say fairy take long time grow do 
20,"""But your pinafore?"" said Jack.",pinafore say 
21,"""Turned into an apron, of course,"" replied the fairy, ""just as your velvet jacket will turn into a tail-coat when you are old enough.""",turn apron course reply fairy velvet jacket turn tail coat old 
22,"""It won't,"" said Jack.",say 
23,"""Yes it will,"" answered the fairy, with an air of superior wisdom. ""Don't argue with me; I am older now than you are,--nearly grown up, in fact. Put me into your pocket again, and whistle as loudly as you can.""",answer fairy air superior wisdom argue old grow fact put pocket whistle 
24,"Jack laughed, put her in, and pulled out another. ""Worse and worse,"" he said; ""why, this was a boy fairy, and now he has a mustache and a sword, and looks as fierce as possible!""",laugh put pull bad bad say boy fairy have mustache sword look fierce possible 
25,"""I think I heard my sister tell you to whistle?"" said this fairy, very sternly.",think hear sister tell whistle say fairy 
26,"""Yes, she did,"" said Jack. ""Well, I suppose I had better do it."" So he whistled very loudly indeed.",say suppose good do whistle 
27,"""Why did you leave off so soon?"" said another of them, peeping out.",leave say peep 
28,"""Why, if you wish to know,"" answered Jack, ""it was because I thought something took hold of my legs.""",wish know answer think take hold leg 
29,"""Ridiculous child!"" cried the last of the four, ""how do you think you are ever to get out, if she doesn't take hold of your legs?""",ridiculous child cry last think get take hold leg 
30,"Jack thought he would rather have done a long-division sum than have been obliged to whistle; but he could not help doing it when they told him, and he felt something take hold of his legs again, and then give him a jerk, which hoisted him on to its back, where he sat astride, and wondered whether the thing was a pony; but it was not, for he presently observed that it had a very slender neck, and then that it was covered with feathers. It was a large bird, and he presently found that they were rising towards the hole, which had become so very far off, and in a few minutes she dashed through the hole, with Jack on her back and all the fairies in his pockets.",think do long division sum oblige whistle help do tell feel take hold leg give jerk hoist back sit wonder thing pony observe have slender neck cover feather large bird find rise hole become few minute dash hole back fairy pocket 
31,"It was so dark that he could see nothing, and he twined his arms round the bird's neck, to hold on, upon which this agreeable fowl told him not to be afraid, and said she hoped he was comfortable.",dark see twin arm bird neck hold agreeable fowl tell afraid say hope comfortable 
32,"""I should be more comfortable,"" replied Jack, ""if I knew how I could get home again. I don't wish to go home just yet, for I want to see where we are flying to, but papa and mamma will be frightened if I never do.""",comfortable reply know get wish go want see fly mamma frighten do 
33,"""Oh no,"" replied the albatross (for she was an albatross), ""you need not be at all afraid about that. When boys go to Fairyland, their parents never are uneasy about them.""",reply albatross albatross afraid boy go parent uneasy 
34,"""Really?"" exclaimed Jack.",exclaim 
35,"""Quite true,"" replied the albatross.",true reply albatross 
36,"""And so we are going to Fairyland?"" exclaimed Jack; ""how delightful!""",go exclaim delightful 
37,"""Yes,"" said the albatross; ""the back way, mind; we are only going the back way. You could go in two minutes by the usual route; but these young fairies want to go before they are summoned, and therefore you and I are taking them."" And she continued to fly on in the dark sky for a very long time.",say albatross back way mind go back way go minute usual route young fairy want go summon take continue fly dark sky long time 
38,"""They seem to be all fast asleep,"" said Jack.",seem fast asleep say 
39,"""Perhaps they will sleep till we come to the wonderful river,"" replied the albatross; and just then she flew with a great bump against something that met her in the air.",sleep come wonderful river reply albatross fly great bump meet air 
40,"""What craft is this that hangs out no light?"" said a gruff voice.",craft hang light say gruff voice 
41,"""I might ask the same question of you,"" answered the albatross, sullenly.",ask same question answer albatross 
42,"""I'm only a poor Will-o'-the-wisp,"" replied the voice, ""and you know very well that I have but a lantern to show."" Thereupon a lantern became visible, and Jack saw by the light of it a man, who looked old and tired, and he was so transparent that you could see through him, lantern and all.",poor o' wisp reply voice know have lantern show lantern become visible see light man look old tired transparent see lantern 
43,"""I hope I have not hurt you, William,"" said the albatross; ""I will light up immediately. Good-night.""",hope hurt say albatross light good night 
44,"""Good-night,"" answered the Will-o'-the-wisp. ""I am going down as fast as I can; the storm blew me up, and I am never easy excepting in my native swamps.""",good night answer wisp go storm blow easy except native swamp 
45,"Jack might have taken more notice of Will, if the albatross had not begun to light up. She did it in this way. First, one of her eyes began to gleam with a beautiful green light, which cast its rays far and near, and then, when it was as bright as a lamp, the other eye began to shine, and the light of that eye was red. In short, she was lighted up just like a vessel at sea.",take more notice albatross begin light do way eye begin gleam beautiful green light cast ray bright lamp other eye begin shine light eye red short light vessel sea 
46,"Jack was so happy that he hardly knew which to look at first, there really were so many remarkable things.",happy know look be many remarkable thing 
47,"""They snore,"" said the albatross, ""they are very fast asleep, and before they wake I should like to talk to you a little.""",snore say albatross fast asleep wake like talk little 
48,"She meant that the fairies snored, and so they did, in Jack's pockets.",mean fairy snore pocket 
49,"""My name,"" continued the albatross, ""is Jenny. Do you think you shall remember that? because, when you are in Fairyland and want some one to take you home again, and call 'Jenny,' I shall be able to come to you; and I shall come with pleasure, for I like boys better than fairies.""",name continue albatross think remember want one take call able come come pleasure like boy good fairy 
50,"""Thank you,"" said Jack. ""Oh yes, I shall remember your name, it is such a very easy one.""",thank say remember name easy one 
51,"""If it is in the night that you want me, just look up,"" continued the albatross, ""and you will see a green and a red spark moving in the air; you will then call Jenny, and I will come; but remember that I cannot come unless you do call me.""",night want look continue albatross see green red spark move air call come remember come call 
52,"""Very well,"" said Jack; but he was not attending, because there was so much to be seen.",say attend be much see 
53,"In the first place, all the stars excepting a few large ones were gone, and they looked frightened; and as it got lighter, one after the other seemed to give a little start in the blue sky and go out. And then Jack looked down and saw, as he thought, a great country, covered with very jagged snow mountains with astonishingly sharp peaks. Here and there he saw a very deep lake,--at least he thought it was a lake; but while he was admiring the mountains, there came an enormous crack between two of the largest, and he saw the sun come rolling up among them, and it seemed to be almost smothered.",first place star except few large one gone look frighten get light other seem give little start blue sky go look see think great country cover jagge snow mountain sharp peak see deep lake least think lake admire mountain come enormous crack large see sun come roll seem smother 
54,"""Why, those are clouds!"" exclaimed Jack; ""and O how rosy they have all turned! I thought they were mountains.""",cloud exclaim rosy turn think mountain 
55,"""Yes, they are clouds,"" said the albatross; and then they turned gold color; and next they began to plunge and tumble, and every one of the peaks put on a glittering crown; and next they broke themselves to pieces, and began to drift away. In fact, Jack had been out all night, and now it was morning.",cloud say albatross turn gold color begin plunge tumble peak put glitter crown break piece begin drift fact night morning
