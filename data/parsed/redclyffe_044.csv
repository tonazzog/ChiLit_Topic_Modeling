4," One Afternoon, late in April, Charles opened the dressing-room door, and paused a moment, smiling. There sat Amabel on the floor before the fire, her hand stretched out, playfully holding back the little one, who, with scanty, flossy, silken curls, hazel eyes and jet-black lashes, plump, mottled arms, and tiny tottering feet, stood crowing and shouting in exulting laughter, having just made a triumphant clutch at her mamma’s hair, and pulled down all the light, shining locks, while under their shade the reddening, smiling face recalled the Amy of days long gone by.",afternoon open dress room door pause moment smile sit floor fire hand stretch hold little one scanty flossy silken curl hazel eye jet black lash plump mottle arm tiny totter foot stand crow shouting exult laughter make triumphant clutch mamma hair pull light shine lock shade reddening smile face recall day go

If it had not been for Guy, his fashion of goodness would have made me into an extract of gall and wormwood, at the very time you admired him, and yet a great deal of it was genuine. But it is only now that I have liked him. Nay, I look up to him, I think him positively noble and grand, and when I see proofs of his being entirely repentant, I perceive he is a thorough great man.

45,"Mrs. Henley was, meanwhile, highly satisfied with the impression she thought she was making on her aunt’s family, especially on Charles and Charlotte. The latter she patronized, to her extreme though suppressed indignation, as a clever, promising girl; the former, she discovered to be a very superior young man, a most valuable assistant to her brother in his business, and her self-complacency prevented her from finding out how he was playing her off, whenever neither Philip nor Laura were at hand to be hurt by it.",satisfied impression think make aunt family latter patronize extreme suppress indignation clever promising girl former discover superior young man valuable assistant brother business self complacency prevent find play hand hurt 
46,"She thought Laura a fine-looking person, like her own family, and fit to be an excellent lady of the house; and in spite of the want of fortune, she perceived that her brother’s choice had been far better than if he had married that poor pale little Amabel, go silent and quiet that she never could make a figure anywhere, and had nothing like the substantive character that her brother must have in a wife.",think fine look person own family fit excellent lady house spite want fortune perceive brother choice good marry poor pale little go silent quiet make figure have substantive character brother have wife

48,"‘One kiss for mamma; and one for papa,’ was Amy’s half-uttered morning greeting, as she lifted from her cot her little one, with cheeks flushed by sleep.

51,"So she put on such a dress as would be hers for life--black silk, and face cap over her still plain hair, then with real pleasure she put on Charles’s bracelet, and the silver brooch, which she had last worn the evening when the echoes of Recoara had answered Guy’s last chant. Soon she was visiting Laura, cheering her, soothing her agitation, helping her to dress in her bridal array, much plainer than Amy’s own had been, for it had been the especial wish of both herself and Philip that their wedding should be as quiet and unlike Guy’s as possible. Then Amabel was running down-stairs to see that all was right, thinking the breakfast-table looked dull and forlorn, and calling Charlotte to help her to make it appear a little more festal, with the aid of some flowers. Charlotte wondered to see that she had forgotten how she shunned flowers last summer, for there she was flitting from one old familiar plant to another in search of the choicest, arranging little bouquets with her own peculiar grace and taste, and putting them by each person’s place, in readiness to receive them.",put dress life black silk face cap plain hair real pleasure put bracelet silver brooch wear evening echo answer last chant visit cheer soothing agitation help dress bridal array plainer own especial wish wedding quiet guy possible run stair see right think breakfast table look dull forlorn call help make appear little festal aid flower wonder see forget shunn flower last summer flit old familiar plant search choicest arrange little bouquet own peculiar grace taste put person place readiness receive 
52,"It was as if no one else could smile that morning, except Mr. Edmonstone, who was so pleased to see her looking cheerful, in her altered dress, that he kissed her repeatedly, and confidentially told Mrs. Henley that his little Amy was a regular darling, the sweetest girl in the world, poor dear, except Laura.",else smile morning pleased see look cheerful alter dress kiss tell little regular darling sweetest girl world poor dear 
53,"Mrs. Henley, in the richest of all silks, looked magnificent and superior. Mrs. Edmonstone had tears in her eyes, and attended to every one softly and kindly, without a word; Charlotte was grave, helpful, and thoughtful; Charles watching every one, and intent on making things smooth; Laura looked fixed in the forced composure which she had long ago learnt, and Philip,--it was late before he appeared at all, and when he came down, there was nothing so plainly written on his face as headache.",rich silk look magnificent superior have tear eye attend one word grave helpful thoughtful watch one intent make thing smooth look fix force composure learn late appear come be write face headache 
54,"It was so severe that the most merciful thing was to send him to lie on the sofa in the dressing-room. Amabel said she would fetch him some camphor, and disappeared, while Laura sat still with her forced composure. Her father fidgeted, only restrained by her presence from expressing his fears that Philip was too unwell for the marriage to take place to-day, and Charles talked cheerfully of the great improvement in his general health, saying this was but a chance thing, and that on the whole he might be considered as quite restored.",severe merciful thing send lie sofa dress room say fetch camphor disappear sit force composure father fidget restrain presence express fear unwell marriage take place day talk great improvement general health say chance thing whole consider restore

65,"They left her, and she stood a few minutes to enjoy the solitude, and to look from the window at her little girl, whom she had sent out with Anne. She was just about to open the window to call to her, and make her look up with one of her merry shouts of ‘Mamma!’ when Philip came out at the garden-door, and was crossing the lawn. Mary was very fond of him, flattered by the attention of the tallest person in the house, and she stretched her arms, and gave a cry of summons. Amabel watched him turn instantly, take her from her nurse, and hold her in a close embrace, whilst her little round arms met round his neck. She was unwilling to be restored to Anne, and when he left she looked up in his face, and unprompted, held up to him the primroses and violets in her hand.",leave stand few minute enjoy solitude look window little girl send about open window call make look merry shout come garden door cross lawn fond flatter attention tall person house stretch arm give cry summons watch turn take nurse hold close embrace little round arm meet neck unwilling restore leave look face unprompt hold primrose violet hand

71,"Philip Morville and Laura Edmonstone stood before Mr. Ross. It was not such a wedding as the last. There was more personal beauty, but no such air of freshness, youth, and peace. He was, indeed, a very fine-looking man, his countenance more noble than it had ever been, though pale and not only betraying the present suffering of the throbbing, burning brow, but with the appearance of a care-worn, harassed man, looking more as if his age was five-and-thirty than eight-and-twenty. And she, in her plain white muslin and quiet bonnet, was hardly bridal-looking in dress, and so it was with her face, still beautiful and brilliant in complexion, but with the weight of care permanent on it, and all the shades of feeling concealed by a fixed command of countenance, unable, however, to hide the oppression of dejection and anxiety.",stand wedding last be more personal beauty such air freshness youth peace fine look man countenance noble pale betray present suffering throbb burn brow appearance care wear harass man look age plain white muslin quiet bonnet bridal look dress face beautiful brilliant complexion weight care permanent shade feeling conceal fix command countenance unable hide oppression dejection anxiety 
72,"Yet to the eyes that only beheld the surface, there was nothing but prosperity and happiness in a marriage between a pair who had loved so long and devotedly, and after going through so much for each other’s sake, were united at length, with wealth, honour, and distinction before them. His health was re-established, and the last spring had proved that his talents would place him in such a position as had been the very object of his highest hopes. Was not everything here for which the fondest and most aspiring wishes could seek? Yet for the very reason that there was sadness at almost every heart, not one tear was shed. Mrs. Edmonstone’s thoughts were less engrossed with the bride than with the young slender figure in black, standing in her own drooping way, her head bent down, and the fingers of her right hand clasping tight her wedding-ring, through her white glove.",eye beheld surface be prosperity happiness marriage pair love go much other sake unite length wealth honour distinction health re-establish last spring prove talent place position very object high hope fondest aspire wish seek very reason be sadness heart tear shed thought engross bride young slender figure black stand own droop way head bend finger right hand clasp wedding ring white glove

You were good for something before, but when I look back on what I was when first he came, I know that his leading, unconscious as it was, brought out the stifled good in me.

He was a distinguished man, one of the most honoured and respected in the country, admired for his talents and excellence, and regarded universally as highly prosperous and fortunate, the pride of all who had any connection with him. Yet it was a harassed, anxious life, with little of repose or relief; and Laura spent her time between watching him and tending his health, and in the cares and representation befitting her station, with little space for domestic pleasure and home comfort, knowing her children more intimately through her sister’s observation than through her own.",life show guess distinguished man honoure respect country admire talent excellence regard prosperous fortunate pride have connection harass anxious life little repose relief spend time watch tend health care representation befit station little space domestic pleasure home comfort know child sister observation own

There was some wonder at his being a grave, melancholy man, when he had all before him so richly to enjoy, contrary to every probability when he began life. Still there was one who never could understand why others should think him stern and severe, and why even his own children should look up to him with love that partook of distant awe and respect, one to whom he never was otherwise than indulgent, nay, almost reverential, in the gentleness of his kindness, and that was Mary Verena Morville.",perfect devoted love think admirable happy person be wonder grave melancholy man have enjoy contrary probability begin life be understand other think stern severe own child look love partaok distant awe respect indulgent reverential gentleness kindness
