3," In the days of yore, children were not all such clever, good sensible people as they are now! Lessons were then considered rather a plague, sugar-plums were still in demand--holidays continued yet in fashion--and toys were not then made to teach mathematics, nor story-books to give instruction in chemistry and navigation. These were very strange times, and there existed at that period, a very idle, greedy, naughty boy, such as we never hear of in the present day. His papa and mama were----no matter who,----and he lived, no matter where. His name was Master No-book, and he seemed to think his eyes were made for nothing but to stare out of the windows, and his mouth for no other purpose but to eat. This young gentleman hated lessons like mustard, both of which brought tears into his eyes, and during school-hours, he sat gazing at his books, pretending to be busy, while his mind wandered away to wish impatiently for his dinner, and to consider where he could get the nicest pies, pastry, ices, and jellies, while he smacked his lips at the very thoughts of them. I think he must have been first cousin to Peter Grey, but that is not perfectly certain.",day yore child such clever good sensible person lesson consider plague sugar plum demand holiday continue fashion toy make teach mathematics story book give instruction chemistry navigation strange time exist period idle greedy naughty boy such hear present day papa mama matter live matter name seem think eye make stare window mouth other purpose eat young gentleman hate lesson mustard bring tear eye school hour sit gaze book pretend busy mind wander wish dinner consider get nice pie pastry ice jelly smack lip very thought think first cousin certain 
4,"Whenever Master No-book spoke, it was always to ask for something, and you might continually hear him say, in a whining tone of voice, ""Papa! may I take this piece of cake? Aunt Sarah! will you give me an apple? Mama! do send me the whole of that plum-pudding!"" Indeed, very frequently when he did not get permission to gormandize, this naughty glutton helped himself without leave. Even his dreams were like his waking hours, for he had often a horrible night-mare about lessons, thinking that he was smothered with Greek Lexicons, or pelted out of the school with a shower of English Grammars, while one night, he fancied himself sitting down to devour an enormous plum-cake, and that all on a sudden it became transformed into a Latin Dictionary!",master book speak ask hear say whining tone voice take piece cake give apple mama send whole plum pudding get permission gormandize naughty glutton help leave dream wake hour have horrible night mare lesson think smother greek pelt school shower english night fancy sit devour enormous plum cake sudden become transform latin 
5,"One afternoon, Master No-book, having played truant all day from school, was lolling on his mama's best sofa in the drawing-room, with his leather boots tucked up on the satin cushions, and nothing to do but to suck a few oranges, and nothing to think of but how much sugar to put upon them, when suddenly an event took place which filled him with astonishment.",afternoon play truant day school loll mama good sofa draw room leather boot tuck satin cushion do suck few orange think much sugar put event take place fill astonishment 
6,"A sound of soft music stole into the room, becoming louder and louder the longer he listened, till at length, in a few moments afterwards, a large hole burst open in the wall of his room, and there stepped into his presence, two magnificent fairies, just arrived from their castle in the air, to pay him a visit. They had travelled all the way on purpose to have some conversation with Master No-book, and immediately introduced themselves in a very ceremonious manner.",sound soft music steal room become louder louder long listen length few moment large hole burst open wall room step presence magnificent fairy arrive castle air pay visit travel way purpose have conversation introduce ceremonious manner 
7,"The fairy Do-nothing was gorgeously dressed with a wreath of flaming gas round her head, a robe of gold tissue, a necklace of rubies, and a bouquet in her hand, of glittering diamonds. Her cheeks were rouged to the very eyes,--her teeth were set in gold, and her hair was of a most brilliant purple; in short, so fine and fashionable looking a fairy never was seen in a drawing-room before.",fairy do dress wreath flame gas head robe gold tissue necklace ruby bouquet hand glitter diamond cheek rouge very eye tooth set gold hair brilliant purple short fine fashionable look fairy see draw room 
8,"The fairy Teach-all, who followed next, was simply dressed in white muslin, with bunches of natural flowers in her light brown hair, and she carried in her hand a few neat small books, which Master No-book looked at with a shudder of aversion.",fairy follow dress white muslin bunch natural flower light brown hair carry hand few neat small book look shudder aversion 
9,"The two fairies now informed him, that they very often invited large parties of children, to spend some time at their palaces, but as they lived in quite an opposite direction, it was necessary for their young guests to choose which it would be best to visit first; therefore now they had come to inquire of Master No-book, whom he thought it would be most agreeable to accompany on the present occasion.",fairy inform invite large party child spend time palace live opposite direction necessary young guest choose good visit come inquire think agreeable accompany present occasion 
10,"""In my house,"" said the fairy Teach-all, speaking with a very sweet smile, and a soft, pleasing voice, ""you shall be taught to find pleasure in every sort of exertion, for I delight in activity and diligence. My young friends rise at seven every morning, and amuse themselves with working in a beautiful garden of flowers,--rearing whatever fruit they wish to eat,--visiting among the poor,--associating pleasantly together,--studying the arts and sciences,--and learning to know the world in which they live, and to fulfil the purposes for which they have been brought into it. In short, all our amusements tend to some useful object, either for our own improvement or the good of others, and you will grow wiser, better, and happier every day you remain in the Palace of Knowledge.""",house say fairy teach speak sweet smile soft pleasing voice teach find pleasure sort exertion delight activity diligence young friend rise morning amuse work beautiful garden flower rear fruit wish eat visit poor associate study art science learn know world live fulfil purpose bring short amusement tend useful object own improvement good other grow wise good happy day remain 
11,"""But in Castle Needless where I live,"" interrupted the fairy Do-nothing, rudely pushing her companion aside, with an angry contemptuous look, ""we never think of exerting ourselves for anything. You may put your head in your pocket, and your hands in your sides as long as you choose to stay. No one is ever even asked a question, that he may be spared the trouble of answering. We lead the most fashionable life that can be imagined, for nobody speaks to anybody! Each of my visitors is quite an exclusive, and sits with his back to as many of the company as possible, in the most comfortable arm-chair that can be imagined. There, if you are only so good as to take the trouble of wishing for anything, it is yours, without even turning an eye round to look where it comes from. Dresses are provided of the most magnificent kind, which go on of themselves, without your having the smallest annoyance with either buttons or strings,--games which you can play without an effort of thought,--and dishes dressed by a French cook, smoking hot and hot under your nose, from morning till night,--while any rain we have, is either made of cherry brandy, lemonade, or lavender water,--and in winter it generally snows iced-punch for an hour during the forenoon.""",live interrupt fairy push companion angry contemptuous look think exert put head pocket hand side choose stay ask question spare trouble answer lead fashionable life imagine speak visitor exclusive sit back many company possible comfortable arm chair imagine good take trouble wish turn eye look come dresse provide magnificent kind go have small annoyance button string game play effort thought dish dress french cook smoking hot hot nose morning night rain have make cherry brandy lemonade lavender water winter snow ice punch hour forenoon 
12,"Nobody need be told which fairy Master No-book preferred; and quite charmed at his own good fortune in receiving so agreeable an invitation, he eagerly gave his hand to the splendid new acquaintance, who promised him so much pleasure and ease, and gladly proceeded, in a carriage lined with velvet, stuffed with downy pillows, and drawn by milk-white swans, to that magnificent residence Castle Needless, which was lighted by a thousand windows during the day, and by a million of lamps every night.",tell fairy master no-book prefer charm own good fortune receive agreeable invitation give hand splendid new acquaintance promise much pleasure ease proceed carriage line velvet stuff downy pillow draw milk white swan magnificent residence light window day lamp night 
13,"Here Master No-book enjoyed a constant holiday and a constant feast, while a beautiful lady, covered with jewels, was ready to tell him stories from morning till night, and servants waited to pick up his playthings if they fell, or to draw out his purse or his pocket-handkerchief when he wished to use them.",enjoy constant holiday constant feast beautiful lady cover jewel ready tell story morning night servant wait pick plaything fall draw purse pocket handkerchief wish use 
14,"Thus Master No-book lay dozing for hours and days on rich embroidered cushions, never stirring from his place, but admiring the view of trees covered with the richest burned almonds, grottoes of sugar-candy, a jet d'eau of champagne, a wide sea which tasted of sugar instead of salt, and a bright clear pond, filled with gold-fish, that let themselves be caught whenever he pleased. Nothing could be more complete, and yet, very strange to say, Master No-book did not seem particularly happy! This appears exceedingly unreasonable, when so much trouble was taken to please him; but the truth is, that every day he became more fretful and peevish. No sweetmeats were worth the trouble of eating, nothing was pleasant to play at, and in the end he wished it were possible to sleep all day, as well as all night.",master no-book lay doze hour day rich embroider cushion stir place admire view tree cover rich burn almond grottoe sugar candy jet d'eau champagne wide sea taste sugar salt bright clear pond fill gold fish let catch pleased complete strange say seem happy appear unreasonable much trouble take please truth day become fretful peevish sweetmeat worth trouble eat pleasant play end wish possible sleep day night 
15,"Not a hundred miles from the fairy Do-nothing's palace, there lived a most cruel monster called the giant Snap-'em-up, who looked, when he stood up, like the tall steeple of a great church, raising his head so high, that he could peep over the loftiest mountains, and was obliged to climb up a ladder to comb his own hair.",mile fairy do palace live cruel monster call giant snap look stand tall steeple great church raise head high peep loftiest mountain oblige climb ladder comb own hair 
16,"Every morning regularly, this prodigiously great giant walked round the world before breakfast for an appetite, after which, he made tea in a large lake, used the sea as a slop-basin, and boiled his kettle on Mount Vesuvius. He lived in great style, and his dinners were most magnificent, consisting very often of an elephant roasted whole, ostrich patties, a tiger smothered in onions, stewed lions, and whale soup; but for a side-dish his greatest favourite consisted of little boys, as fat as possible, fried in crumbs of bread, with plenty of pepper and salt.",morning great giant walk world breakfast appetite make tea large lake use sea slop basin boil kettle live great style dinner magnificent consist elephant roast whole ostrich patty tiger smother onion stew lion whale soup side dish great favourite consist little boy fat possible fry crumb bread plenty pepper salt 
17,"No children were so well fed, or in such good condition for eating, as those in the fairy Do-nothing's garden, who was a very particular friend of the great Snap-'em-up's, and who sometimes laughingly said she would give him a license, and call her own garden his ""preserve,"" because she allowed him to help himself, whenever he pleased, to as many of her visitors as he chose, without taking the trouble even to count them, and in return for such extreme civility, the giant very frequently invited her to dinner.",child feed such good condition eat fairy do garden particular friend great snap -'em up' say give license call own garden preserve allow help pleased many visitor choose take trouble count return such extreme civility giant invite dinner 
18,"Snap-'em-up's favourite sport was, to see how many brace of little boys he could bag in a morning; so in passing along the streets, he peeped into all the drawing-rooms without having occasion to get upon tiptoe, and picked up every young gentleman who was idly looking out of the windows, and even a few occasionally who were playing truant from school, but busy children seemed always somehow quite out of his reach.",snap they up favourite sport see many brace little boy bag morning pass street peep draw room have occasion get tiptoe pick young gentleman look window few play truant school busy child seem reach 
19,"One day, when Master No-book felt even more lazy, more idle, and more miserable than ever, he lay beside a perfect mountain of toys and cakes, wondering what to wish for next, and hating the very sight of everything and everybody. At last he gave so loud a yawn of weariness and disgust, that his jaw very nearly fell out of joint, and then he sighed so deeply, that the giant Snap-'em-up heard the sound as he passed along the road after breakfast, and instantly stepped into the garden, with his glass at his eye, to see what was the matter. Immediately on observing a large, fat, over-grown boy, as round as a dumpling, lying on a bed of roses, he gave a cry of delight, followed by a gigantic peal of laughter, which was heard three miles off, and picking up Master No-book between his finger and his thumb, with a pinch that very nearly broke his ribs, he carried him rapidly towards his own castle, while the fairy Do-nothing laughingly shook her head as he passed, saying, ""That little man does me great credit!--he has only been fed for a week, and is as fat already as a prize ox! What a dainty morsel he will be! When do you dine to-day, in case I should have time to look in upon you?""",day feel lazy idle miserable lay perfect mountain toy cake wonder wish hate very sight last give yawn weariness disgust jaw fall joint sigh giant snap hear sound pass road breakfast step garden glass eye see matter observe large fat grow boy dumpling lie bed rose give cry delight follow gigantic peal laughter hear mile pick finger thumb pinch break rib carry own castle fairy do shake head pass say little man do great credit feed week fat prize ox dainty morsel dine day case have time look 
20,"On reaching home, the giant immediately hung up Master No-book by the hair of his head, on a prodigious hook in the larder, having first taken some large lumps of nasty suet, forcing them down his throat to make him become still fatter, and then stirring the fire, that he might be almost melted with heat, to make his liver grow larger. On a shelf quite near, Master No-book perceived the dead bodies of six other boys, whom he remembered to have seen fattening in the fairy Do-nothing's garden, while he recollected how some of them had rejoiced at the thoughts of leading a long, useless, idle life, with no one to please but themselves.",reach home giant hang hair head prodigious hook larder take large lump nasty suet force throat make become fatter stir fire melt heat make liver grow large shelf perceive dead body other boy remember see fatten fairy do garden recollect rejoice thought lead long useless idle life 
21,"The enormous cook now seized hold of Master No-book, brandishing her knife, with an aspect of horrible determination, intending to kill him, while he took the trouble of screaming and kicking in the most desperate manner, when the giant turned gravely round and said, that as pigs were considered a much greater dainty when whipped to death than killed in any other way, he meant to see whether children might not be improved by it also; therefore she might leave that great hog of a boy till he had time to try the experiment, especially as his own appetite would be improved by the exercise. This was a dreadful prospect for the unhappy prisoner; but meantime it prolonged his life a few hours, as he was immediately hung up again in the larder, and left to himself. There, in torture of mind and body,--like a fish upon a hook,--the wretched boy began at last to reflect seriously upon his former ways, and to consider what a happy home he might have had, if he could only have been satisfied with business and pleasure succeeding each other, like day and night, while lessons might have come in, as a pleasant sauce to his play-hours, and his play-hours as a sauce to his lessons.",enormous cook seize hold brandish knife aspect horrible determination intend kill take trouble scream kick desperate manner giant turn say pig consider great dainty whip death kill other way mean see child improve leave great hog boy have time try experiment own appetite improve exercise dreadful prospect unhappy prisoner prolong life few hour hang larder leave torture mind body fish hook wretched boy begin last reflect former way consider happy home have satisfy business pleasure succeed other day night lesson come pleasant sauce play hour play hour sauce lesson 
22,"In the midst of many reflections, which were all very sensible, though rather too late. Master No-book's attention became attracted by the sound of many voices laughing, talking, and singing, which caused him to turn his eyes in a new direction, when, for the first time, he observed that the fairy Teach-all's garden lay upon a beautiful sloping bank not far off. There a crowd of merry, noisy, rosy-cheeked boys, were busily employed, and seemed happier than the day was long; while poor Master No-book watched them during his own miserable hours, envying the enjoyment with which they raked the flower-borders, gathered the fruit, carried baskets of vegetables to the poor, worked with carpenters' tools, drew pictures, shot with bows and arrows, played at cricket, and then sat in the sunny arbours learning their tasks, or talking agreeably together, till at length, a dinner-bell having been rung, the whole party sat merrily down with hearty appetites, and cheerful good-humour, to an entertainment of plain roast meat and pudding, where the fairy Teach-all presided herself, and helped her guests moderately, to as much as was good for each.",midst many reflection sensible late master book attention become attract sound many voice laugh talk sing cause turn eye new direction first time observe fairy garden lay beautiful slope bank crowd merry noisy rosy cheeked boy employ seem happy day long poor watch own miserable hour envy enjoyment rake flower border gather fruit carry basket vegetable poor work carpenter tool draw picture shoot bow arrow play cricket sit sunny arbour learn task talk length dinner bell rung whole party sit hearty appetite cheerful good humour entertainment plain roast meat pudding fairy preside help guest much good 
23,"Large tears rolled down the cheeks of Master No-book while watching this scene; and remembering that if he had known what was best for him, he might have been as happy as the happiest of these excellent boys, instead of suffering ennui and weariness, as he had done at the fairy Do-nothing's, ending in a miserable death; but his attention was soon after most alarmingly roused by hearing the giant Snap-'em-up again in conversation with his cook, who said, that if he wished for a good large dish of scolloped children at dinner, it would be necessary to catch a few more, as those he had already provided would scarcely be a mouthful.",large tear roll cheek watch scene remember know good happy happy excellent boy suffer ennui weariness do fairy do end miserable death attention rouse hear giant snap conversation cook say wish good large dish scolloped child dinner necessary catch few more provide mouthful 
24,"As the giant kept very fashionable hours, and always waited dinner for himself till nine o'clock, there was still plenty of time; so, with a loud grumble about the trouble, he seized a large basket in his hand, and set off at a rapid pace towards the fairy Teach-all's garden. It was very seldom that Snap-'em-up ventured to think of foraging in this direction, as he had never once succeeded in carrying off a single captive from the enclosure, it was so well fortified and so bravely defended; but on this occasion, being desperately hungry, he felt as bold as a lion, and walked, with outstretched hands, straight towards the fairy Teach-all's dinner-table, taking such prodigious strides, that he seemed almost as if he would trample on himself.",giant keep fashionable hour wait dinner o'clock be plenty time loud grumble trouble seize large basket hand set rapid pace fairy garden seldom snap venture think forage direction succeed carry single captive enclosure fortify defend occasion hungry feel bold lion walk outstretched hand fairy dinner table take such prodigious stride seem trample 
25,"A cry of consternation arose the instant this tremendous giant appeared; and as usual on such occasions, when he had made the same attempt before, a dreadful battle took place. Fifty active little boys bravely flew upon the enemy, armed with their dinner knives, and looked like a nest of hornets, stinging him in every direction, till he roared with pain, and would have run away, but the fairy Teach-all, seeing his intention, rushed forward with the carving knife, and brandishing it high over her head, she most courageously stabbed him to the heart!",cry consternation arise instant tremendous giant appear usual such occasion make same attempt dreadful battle take place active little boy fly enemy armed dinner knife look nest hornet sting direction roar pain run fairy see intention rush carving knife brandish head stab heart 
26,"If a great mountain had fallen in the earth, it would have seemed like nothing in comparison of the giant Snap-'em-up, who crushed two or three houses to powder beneath him, and upset several fine monuments that were to have made people remembered for ever; but all this would have seemed scarcely worth mentioning, had it not been for a still greater event which occurred on the occasion, no less than the death of the fairy Do-nothing, who had been indolently looking on at this great battle, without taking the trouble to interfere, or even to care who was victorious, but, being also lazy about running away, when the giant fell, his sword came with so violent a stroke on her head, that she instantly expired.",great mountain fall earth seem comparison giant snap -'em up crush house powder upset several fine monument make person remember seem worth mention great event occur occasion less death fairy look great battle take trouble interfere care victorious lazy run giant fall sword come violent stroke head expire 
27,"Thus, luckily for the whole world, the fairy Teach-all got possession of immense property, which she proceeded without delay to make the best use of in her power.",whole world fairy get possession immense property proceed delay make good use power 
28,"In the first place, however, she lost no time in liberating Master No-book from his hook in the larder, and gave him a lecture on activity, moderation, and good conduct, which he never afterwards forgot; and it was astonishing to see the change that took place immediately in his whole thoughts and actions. From this very hour, Master No-book became the most diligent, active, happy boy in the fairy Teach-all's garden; and on returning home a month afterwards, he astonished all the masters at school by his extraordinary reformation. The most difficult lessons were a pleasure to him,--he scarcely ever stirred without a book in his hand,--never lay on a sofa again,--would scarcely even sit on a chair with a back to it, but preferred a three-legged stool,--detested holidays,--never thought any exertion a trouble,--preferred climbing over the top of a hill to creeping round the bottom,--always ate the plainest food in very small quantities,--joined a Temperance Society!-and never tasted a morsel till he had worked very hard and got an appetite.",first place lose time liberate hook larder give lecture activity moderation good conduct forget astonish see change take place whole thought action very hour master no- book become diligent active happy boy fairy garden return month astonished master school extraordinary reformation difficult lesson pleasure stirr book hand lay sofa sit chair back prefer legged stool detest holiday think exertion trouble prefer climb top hill creep bottom eat plainest food small quantity join temperance taste morsel work get appetite 
29,"Not long after this, an old uncle, who had formerly been ashamed of Master No-book's indolence and gluttony, became so pleased at the wonderful change, that, on his death, he left him a magnificent estate, desiring that he should take his name; therefore, instead of being any longer one of the No-book family, he is now called Sir Timothy Bluestocking,--a pattern to the whole country round, for the good he does to every one, and especially for his extraordinary activity, appearing as if he could do twenty things at once. Though generally very good-natured and agreeable, Sir Timothy is occasionally observed in a violent passion, laying about him with his walking-stick in the most terrific manner, and beating little boys within an inch of their lives; but on inquiry, it invariably appears that he has found them out to be lazy, idle, or greedy, for all the industrious boys in the parish are sent to get employment from him, while he assures them that they are far happier breaking stones on the road, than if they were sitting idly in a drawing-room with nothing to do. Sir Timothy cares very little for poetry in general; but the following are his favourite verses, which he has placed over the chimney-piece at a school that he built for the poor, and every scholar is obliged, the very day he begins his education, to learn them:--",old uncle ashamed book indolence gluttony become pleased wonderful change death leave magnificent estate desire take name family call pattern whole country good do one extraordinary activity appear do thing good natured agreeable observe violent passion lay walking stick terrific manner beat little boy inch life inquiry appear find lazy idle greedy industrious boy parish send get employment assure happy break stone road sit draw room do care little poetry general follow favourite verse place chimney piece school build poor scholar oblige very day begin education learn

37,"""As Mrs. Crabtree has not tapped at the door yet, I shall describe the progress of a wise and a foolish man, to see which Harry and you would prefer copying,"" replied Lady Harriet, smiling. ""The fool begins, when he is young, with hating lessons, lying long in bed, and spending all his money on trash. Any books he will consent to read, are never about what is true or important; but he wastes all his time and thoughts on silly stories that never could have happened. Thus he neglects to learn what was done, and thought, by all the great and good men who really lived in former times, while even his Bible, if he has one, grows dusty on the shelf. After so bad a beginning, he grows up with no useful or interesting knowledge; therefore his whole talk is to describe his own horses, his own dogs, his own guns, and his own exploits; boasting of what a high wall his horse can leap over, the number of little birds he can shoot in a day, and how many bottles of wine he can swallow without tumbling under the table. Thus, 'glorying in his shame,' he thinks himself a most wonderful person, not knowing that men are born to do much better things than merely to find selfish pleasure and amusement for themselves. Presently he grows old, gouty, and infirm--no longer able to do such prodigious achievements; therefore now his great delight is, to sit with his feet upon the fender, at a club all day, telling what a famous rider, shooter, and drinker, he was long ago; but nobody cares to hear such old stories; therefore he is called a 'proser,' and every person avoids him. It is no wonder a man talks about himself, if he has never read or thought about any one else. But at length his precious time has all been wasted, and his last hour comes, during which he can have nothing to look back upon but a life of folly and guilt. He sees no one around who loves him, or will weep over his grave; and when he looks forward, it is towards an eternal world which he has never prepared to enter, and of which he knows nothing.""",tap door describe progress wise foolish man see prefer copy reply smile fool begin young hate lesson lie bed spend money trash book consent read true important waste time thought silly story happen neglect learn do think great good man live former time have grow dusty shelf bad beginning grow useful interesting knowledge whole talk describe own horse own dog own gun own exploit boast high wall horse leap number little bird shoot day many bottle wine swallow tumble table glory shame think wonderful person know man bear do good thing find selfish pleasure amusement grow old gouty infirm able do such prodigious achievement great delight sit foot fender club day tell famous rider shooter drinker long care hear such old story call proser person avoid wonder man talk read think one else length precious time waste last hour come have look life folly guilt see love weep grave look eternal world prepare enter know 
38,"""What a terrible picture, grandmama!"" said Frank, rather gravely. ""I hope there are not many people like that, or it would be very sad to meet with them. Now pray let us have a pleasanter description of the sort of persons you would like Harry and me to become.""",terrible picture grandmama say hope be many person sad meet pray let have pleasanter description sort person like become 
39,"""The first foundation of all is, as you already know, Frank, to pray that you may be put in the right course and kept in it, for of ourselves we are so sinful and weak that we can do no good thing. Then feeling a full trust in the Divine assistance, you must begin and end every day with studying your Bible, not merely reading it, but carefully endeavouring to understand and obey what it contains. Our leisure should be bestowed on reading of wiser and better people than ourselves, which will keep us humble while it instructs our understandings, and thus we shall be fitted to associate with persons whose society is even better than books. Christians who are enlightened and sanctified in the knowledge of all good things, will show us an example of carefully using our time, which is the most valuable of all earthly possessions. If we waste our money, we may perhaps get more--if we lose our health, it may be restored--but time squandered on folly, must hereafter be answered for, and can never be regained. Whatever be your station in life, waste none of your thoughts upon fancying how much better you might have acted in some other person's place, but see what duties belong to that station in which you live, and do what that requires with activity and diligence. When we are called to give an account of our stewardship, let us not have to confess at the last that we wasted our one talent, because we wished to have been trusted with ten; but let us prepare to render up what was given to us, with joy and thankfulness, perfectly satisfied that the best place in life is where God appoints, and where He will guide us to a safe and peaceful end.""",first foundation know pray put right course keep sinful weak do good thing feel full trust divine assistance begin end day study read endeavour understand obey contain leisure bestow reading wise good person keep humble instruct understanding fit associate person society good book enlightened sanctify knowledge good thing show example use time valuable earthly possession waste money get more lose health restore time squander folly answer regain station life waste thought fancy good act other person place see duty belong station live do require activity diligence call give account stewardship let have confess last waste talent wish trust let prepare render give joy thankfulness satisfied good place life appoint guide safe peaceful end 
40,"""Yes!"" added Major Graham. ""You have two eyes in your minds as well as in your bodies. With one of these we see all that is good or agreeable in our lot--with the other we see all that is unpleasant or disappointing, and you may generally choose which eye to keep open. Some of my friends always peevishly look at the troubles and vexations they endure, but they might turn them into good, by considering that every circumstance is sent from the same hand, with the same merciful purpose--to make us better now and happier hereafter.""",add have eye mind body see good agreeable lot other see unpleasant disappointing choose eye keep open friend look trouble vexation endure turn good consider circumstance send same hand same merciful purpose make good happy
