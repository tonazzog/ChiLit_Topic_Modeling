2," ‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.",cry forget flurry moment large grow last few minute jump hurry tip jury box edge skirt upsetting jurymen head crowd lay sprawl remind much globe goldfish upset week 
3,"‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.",beg pardon exclaim tone great dismay begin pick accident goldfish keep run head have vague sort idea collect put jury box die

5,"Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said to herself; ‘I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.’",look jury box see haste put head poor little thing wave tail melancholy way unable move get put signify much say think much use trial way other 
6,"As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.",jury have little recover shock upset slate pencil find hand set work write history accident seem overcome do sit mouth open gaze roof court

11,"‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury.

15,"At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.’",moment time write note book cackle read book person more mile high leave court

51,"‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,’ he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added, turning to the Knave.",be meaning say save world trouble know try find know go spread verse knee look eye seem see meaning say swim swim add turn

56,"‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)",say throw inkstand speak unfortunate little leave write slate finger find make mark begin use ink trickle face last 
57,"‘Then the words don’t FIT you,’ said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.",word fit say look court smile be dead silence

65,"At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.",whole pack rise air come fly give little scream half fright half anger try beat find lie bank head lap sister brush dead leave flutter tree face 
66,"‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve had!’",wake dear say sister long sleep have 
67,"‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.",have curious dream say tell sister remember strange adventure read finish sister kiss say curious dream dear run tea get late get run think run wonderful dream 
68,"But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--",sister sit leave lean head hand watch setting sun think little wonderful begin dreaming fashion dream 
69,"First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream.",dream little tiny hand clasp knee bright eager eye look hear very tone voice see queer little toss head keep wonder hair get eye listen seem listen whole place become alive strange creature little sister dream 
70,"The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.",long grass rustle foot white hurry frighten splash way neighbour pool hear rattle teacup friend share end meal shrill voice order unfortunate guest execution pig-baby sneez knee plate dish crash shriek squeaking slate pencil choke suppress guinea pig fill air mix distant sob miserable 
71,"So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.",sit close eye half believe know have open change dull reality grass rustle wind pool ripple wave reed rattling teacup change tinkling sheep bell shrill cry voice shepherd boy sneeze baby shriek other queer noise change know confuse clamour busy farm yard lowing cattle distance take place heavy sob 
72,"Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.",picture same little sister time grow woman keep riper year simple loving heart childhood gather other little child make eye bright eager many strange tale dream feel simple sorrow find pleasure simple joy remember own child life happy summer day
