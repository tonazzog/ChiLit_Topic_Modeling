2,"On the Monday morning, William and Ready went away in the boat, as before, to bring round the various articles from the cove.  It had been arranged that they were not to return till the Saturday evening, and that the dog Remus was to bring intelligence of them and their welfare every afternoon.  They worked hard during the week, and on Saturday they had completed their task; with the exception of a portion of the timbers of the ship, everything had been brought round, but had not been carried up to the storehouse, as that required more time.",morning go boat bring various article cove arrange return evening dog bring intelligence welfare afternoon work week complete task exception portion timber ship bring carry storehouse require more time 
3,"On Saturday morning, they went for the last time to the cove, and Ready selected some heavy oak timber out of the quantity which was lying on the beach, part of which they put into the boat, and the remainder they towed astern.  It was a heavy load, and although the wind was fair to sail back again to the bay, the boat went but slowly through the water.",morning go last time cove ready select heavy oak timber quantity lie beach part put boat remainder tow heavy load wind fair sail bay boat go water 
4,"""Well, William,"" said Ready, ""we have done a good week's work, and I must say it is high time that it is done; for the boat is in rather a crazy condition, and I must contrive to patch her up by and by, when there is time.""",say ready do good week work say high time do boat crazy condition contrive patch be time 
5,"""We shall not want to use her very much after this, Ready,"" replied William; ""a few trips round to the little harbour will be all that will be required before we come back again to our old quarters.""",want use ready reply few trip little harbour require come old quarter

7,"""Pray, Ready, why, when you speak of a ship or boat, do you always call it she?""",pray ready speak ship boat call 
8,"""Well, William, I don't know why, but it is certain that we sailors always do so.  I believe it is because a sailor loves his ship.  His ship is his wife, is a very common saying with us; and then you see, Master William, a vessel is almost a thing of life in appearance.  I believe that's the reason, and of course if a vessel is she, a little boat must be a she also.""",know certain sailor do believe sailor love ship ship wife common say see vessel thing life appearance believe reason course vessel little boat 
9,"""Well, I think you have explained it very well, Ready.  I suppose on Monday we shall set to at the storehouse, and alter it for our future residence?""",think explain ready suppose set storehouse alter future residence 
10,"""Can't begin too soon, William,"" replied Ready; ""I don't doubt but Mr Seagrave has finished the hedge and ditch round the yams by this time, and if so, I expect Madam will not like to be left in the tents alone with Juno and the children, and so we shall all move back to the house again until we have altered the storehouse; I must say that I would rather your mamma remained in the tents until all was finished.""",begin reply ready doubt finish hedge ditch yam time expect like leave tent child move house alter storehouse say rather mamma remain tent finish

13,"""But, Ready, if they do come, we shall see them coming, and would it not be better that we should all be together, even if we are obliged to conceal ourselves in consequence of not being prepared?  Suppose the savages were to overrun the island, and find my mother, my little brother, and sister, defenceless, at the time we were obliged to retreat from our house; how dreadful that would be!""",ready come see come good oblige conceal consequence prepare suppose savage overrun island find mother little brother sister defenceless time oblige retreat house dreadful

15,"""So we can all together, unless we are surprised in the night.""",surprise night 
16,"""That we must take care not to be.  There's not three hours' dark in this season of the year.  Well, William, I doubt not you may be right, and if they are all with us, Juno will be a great help, and we shall get through our work the faster.""",take care be hour dark season year doubt right great help get work fast 
17,"""We had better let the question be decided by my father and mother.""",have good let question decide father mother 
18,"""Very true, William; here's the point at last.  We will haul the timber on the beach, and then be off as fast as we can, for it is getting late.""",true point last haul timber beach get late 
19,"It was, indeed, much later than they had usually arrived at the little harbour, owing to the heavy load, which made the boat so long in coming round from the cove; and when they pulled in, they found Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the children all waiting for them.",arrive little harbour ow heavy load make boat come cove pull find child wait 
20,"""You are very late, William,"" said Mrs Seagrave.  ""I was quite uneasy till I saw the boat at a distance.""",late say uneasy see boat distance

23,"""And my work is done,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""the hedge and ditch were finished this morning.""",work do say hedge ditch finish morning 
24,"""Well, then,"" observed Ready, ""we must hold another council, but I presume it will not take very long.""",observe ready hold council presume take 
25,"""No; I expect not; it seldom does when people are of the same mind. Mrs Seagrave won't be left here, Ready, and I don't want to leave her, so I presume on Monday we all start home again.""",expect person same mind leave ready want leave presume start home 
26,"""Yes, sir; if you please,"" replied Ready.",sir reply ready
