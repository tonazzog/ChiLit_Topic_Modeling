1,CHAPTER XXXVII. ONCE MORE,more 
2," THE next night Diamond was seated by his open window, with his head on his hand, rather tired, but so eagerly waiting for the promised visit that he was afraid he could not sleep. But he started suddenly, and found that he had been already asleep. He rose, and looking out of the window saw something white against his beech-tree. It was North Wind. She was holding by one hand to a top branch. Her hair and her garments went floating away behind her over the tree, whose top was swaying about while the others were still.",next night seat open window head hand tired wait promise visit afraid sleep start find asleep rise look window see white beech tree hold hand top branch hair garment go float tree top sway other 
3,"“Are you ready, Diamond?” she asked.",ready ask 
4,"“Yes,” answered Diamond, “quite ready.”",answer ready 
5,"In a moment she was at the window, and her arms came in and took him. She sailed away so swiftly that he could at first mark nothing but the speed with which the clouds above and the dim earth below went rushing past. But soon he began to see that the sky was very lovely, with mottled clouds all about the moon, on which she threw faint colours like those of mother-of-pearl, or an opal. The night was warm, and in the lady’s arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn, and ripples on the rivers and lakes. At length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill, just where, from beneath a stone, a spring came bubbling out.",moment window arm come take sail first mark speed cloud dim earth go rush begin see sky lovely mottled cloud moon throw faint colour mother pearl opal night warm lady arm feel wind make wave ripe corn ripple river lake length descend side open earthy hill stone spring come bubble 
6,"“I am going to take you along this little brook,” said North Wind. “I am not wanted for anything else to-night, so I can give you a treat.”",go take little brook say want else night give treat 
7,"She stooped over the stream and holding Diamond down close to the surface of it, glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill. And the song of the brook came up into Diamond’s ears, and grew and grew and changed with every turn. It seemed to Diamond to be singing the story of its life to him. And so it was. It began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing. Sometimes its song would almost cease, and then break out again, tinkle, babble, and rush, all at once. At the bottom of the hill they came to a small river, into which the brook flowed with a muffled but merry sound. Along the surface of the river, darkly clear below them in the moonlight, they floated; now, where it widened out into a little lake, they would hover for a moment over a bed of water-lilies, and watch them swing about, folded in sleep, as the water on which they leaned swayed in the presence of North Wind; and now they would watch the fishes asleep among their roots below. Sometimes she would hold Diamond over a deep hollow curving into the bank, that he might look far into the cool stillness. Sometimes she would leave the river and sweep across a clover-field. The bees were all at home, and the clover was asleep. Then she would return and follow the river. It grew wider and wider as it went. Now the armies of wheat and of oats would hang over its rush from the opposite banks; now the willows would dip low branches in its still waters; and now it would lead them through stately trees and grassy banks into a lovely garden, where the roses and lilies were asleep, the tender flowers quite folded up, and only a few wide-awake and sending out their life in sweet, strong odours. Wider and wider grew the stream, until they came upon boats lying along its banks, which rocked a little in the flutter of North Wind’s garments. Then came houses on the banks, each standing in a lovely lawn, with grand trees; and in parts the river was so high that some of the grass and the roots of some of the trees were under water, and Diamond, as they glided through between the stems, could see the grass at the bottom of the water. Then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses, one after another--beautiful rich houses, which, like fine trees, had taken centuries to grow. There was scarcely a light to be seen, and not a movement to be heard: all the people in them lay fast asleep.",stoop stream hold surface glide level flow run hill song brook come ear grow grow change turn seem sing story life begin musical tinkle change babble gentle rush song cease break tinkle babble rush bottom hill come small river brook flow muffled merry sound surface river clear moonlight float widen little lake hover moment bed water lilie watch swing fold sleep water learn sway presence watch fish asleep root hold deep hollow curving bank look cool stillness leave river sweep clover field bee home clover asleep return follow river grow wide wide go army wheat oat hang rush opposite bank willow dip low branch still water lead stately tree grassy bank lovely garden rose lilie asleep tender flower fold few wide awake send life sweet strong odour wider grow stream come boat lie bank rock little flutter garment come house bank stand lovely lawn grand tree part river high grass root tree water glide stem see grass bottom water leave river float house beautiful rich house fine tree take century grow be light see movement hear person lay asleep 
8,“What a lot of dreams they must be dreaming!” said Diamond.,lot dream dreaming say 
9,"“Yes,” returned North Wind. “They can’t surely be all lies--can they?”",return lie 
10,"“I should think it depends a little on who dreams them,” suggested Diamond.",think depend little dream suggest 
11,"“Yes,” said North Wind. “The people who think lies, and do lies, are very likely to dream lies. But the people who love what is true will surely now and then dream true things. But then something depends on whether the dreams are home-grown, or whether the seed of them is blown over somebody else’s garden-wall. Ah! there’s some one awake in this house!”",say person think lie do lie likely dream lie person love true dream true thing depend dream home grow seed blow else garden wall be one awake house 
12,"They were floating past a window in which a light was burning. Diamond heard a moan, and looked up anxiously in North Wind’s face.",float window light burn hear moan look face

22,"By a shaded lamp, a lady was seated in a white wrapper, trying to read, but moaning every minute. North Wind floated behind her chair, set Diamond down, and told him to sing something. He was a little frightened, but he thought a while, and then sang:--",shade lamp lady seat white wrapper try read moan minute float chair set tell sing little frighten think while sing 
23,"           The sun is gone down,            And the moon’s in the sky;            But the sun will come up,            And the moon be laid by.",sun gone moon sky sun come moon lay 
24,"           The flower is asleep            But it is not dead;            When the morning shines,            It will lift its head.",flower asleep dead morning shine lift head

47,"“Oh!” cried Diamond, “I know now where we are. Oh! do let me go into the old garden, and into mother’s room, and Diamond’s stall. I wonder if the hole is at the back of my bed still. I should like to stay there all the rest of the night. It won’t take you long to get home from here, will it, North Wind?”",cry know let go old garden mother room stall wonder hole back bed like stay rest night take get

49,"“Oh, how jolly,” cried Diamond, as North Wind sailed over the house with him, and set him down on the lawn at the back.",jolly cry sail house set lawn back 
50,"Diamond ran about the lawn for a little while in the moonlight. He found part of it cut up into flower-beds, and the little summer-house with the coloured glass and the great elm-tree gone. He did not like this, and ran into the stable. There were no horses there at all. He ran upstairs. The rooms were empty. The only thing left that he cared about was the hole in the wall where his little bed had stood; and that was not enough to make him wish to stop. He ran down the stair again, and out upon the lawn. There he threw himself down and began to cry. It was all so dreary and lost!",run lawn little while moonlight find part cut flower bed little summer house coloured glass great elm tree gone like run stable be horse run room empty only thing leave care hole wall little bed stand enough make wish stop run stair lawn throw begin cry dreary lose 
51,"“I thought I liked the place so much,” said Diamond to himself, “but I find I don’t care about it. I suppose it’s only the people in it that make you like a place, and when they’re gone, it’s dead, and you don’t care a bit about it. North Wind told me I might stop as long as I liked, and I’ve stopped longer already. North Wind!” he cried aloud, turning his face towards the sky.",think like place say find care suppose person make place gone dead care bit tell stop like stop cry turn face sky 
52,"The moon was under a cloud, and all was looking dull and dismal. A star shot from the sky, and fell in the grass beside him. The moment it lighted, there stood North Wind.",moon cloud look dull dismal star shot sky fall grass moment light stand

61,"“Yes, more than enough. It isn’t a home at all now.”",more enough home 
62,"“I thought that would be it,” said North Wind. “Everything, dreaming and all, has got a soul in it, or else it’s worth nothing, and we don’t care a bit about it. Some of our thoughts are worth nothing, because they’ve got no soul in them. The brain puts them into the mind, not the mind into the brain.”",think say dreaming get soul worth care bit thought worth get soul brain put mind mind brain
