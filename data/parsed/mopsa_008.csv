2,"  In the night she told a story,     In the night and all night through,   While the moon was in her glory,     And the branches dropped with dew.",night tell story night night moon glory branch drop dew 
3,"  'Twas my life she told, and round it     Rose the years as from a deep;   In the world's great heart she found it,     Cradled like a child asleep.",twa life tell year deep world great heart find cradle child asleep 
4,"  In the night I saw her weaving     By the misty moonbeam cold,   All the weft her shuttle cleaving     With a sacred thread of gold.",night see weave misty moonbeam cold go shuttle cleave sacred thread gold 
5,"  Ah! she wept me tears of sorrow,     Lulling tears so mystic sweet;   Then she wove my last to-morrow,     And her web lay at my feet.",goot tear sorrow lull tear mystic sweet wove last web lay foot 
6,"  Of my life she made the story:     I must weep--so soon 'twas told!   But your name did lend it glory,     And your love its thread of gold!",life make story weep tell name lend glory love thread gold 
7," By this time, as the sun had gone down, and none of the moons had risen, it would have been dark but that each of the rafts was rigged with a small mast that had a lantern hung to it.",time sun go moon rise dark raft rig small mast have lantern hang 
8,"By the light of these lanterns Jack saw crowds of little brown faces; and presently many rafts had come up to the boat, which was now swimming very slowly. Every sailor in every raft fastened to the boat's side a silken thread; then the rafts were rowed to shore, and the sailors jumped out, and began to tow the boat along.",light lantern see crowd little brown face many raft come boat swim sailor raft fasten boat side silken thread raft row shore sailor jump begin tow boat 
9,[A STORY.--PAGE 106.],page 
10,"These crimson threads looked no stronger than the silk that ladies sew with, yet by means of them the small people drew the boat along merrily. There were so many of them that they looked like an army as they marched in the light of the lanterns and torches. Jack thought they were very happy, though the work was hard, for they shouted and sang.",crimson thread look strong silk lady sew means small person draw boat be many look army march light lantern torche think happy work hard shout sing 
11,"The fairy woman looked more beautiful than ever now, and far more stately. She had on a band of precious stones to bind back her hair, and they shone so brightly in the night that her features could be clearly seen.",fairy woman look beautiful stately have band precious stone bind hair shine night feature see 
12,"Jack's little favorite was fast asleep, and the other two fairies had flown away. He was beginning to feel rather sleepy himself, when he was roused by the voice of his free lady, who said to him, ""Jack, there is no one listening now, so I will tell you my story. I am the Fairy Queen!""",little favorite fast asleep other fairy fly begin feel sleepy rouse voice free lady say be listen tell story 
13,"Jack opened his eyes very wide, but he was so much surprised that he did not say a word.",open eye wide surprised say word 
14,"""One day, long, long ago,"" said the Queen, ""I was discontented with my own happy country. I wished to see the world, so I set forth with a number of the one-foot-one fairies, and went down the wonderful river, thinking to see the world.",day long say discontent own happy country wish see world set number foot fairy go wonderful river think see world 
15,"""So we sailed down the river till we came to that town which you know of; and there, in the very middle of the stream, stood a tower,--a tall tower, built upon a rock.",sail river come town know very middle stream stand tower tall tower build rock 
16,"""Fairies are afraid of nothing but of other fairies, and we did not think this tower was fairy-work, so we left our ship and went up the rock and into the tower, to see what it was like; but just as we had descended into the dungeon keep, we heard the gurgling of water overhead, and down came the tower. It was nothing but water enchanted into the likeness of stone, and we all fell down with it into the very bed of the river.",fairy afraid other fairy think tower fairy work leave ship go rock tower see like descend dungeon keep hear gurgling water come tower water enchant likeness stone fall very bed river 
17,"""Of course we were not drowned, but there we were obliged to lie, for we have no power out of our own element; and the next day the towns-people came down with a net and dragged the river, picked us all out of the meshes, and made us slaves. The one-foot-one fairies got away shortly; but from that day to this, in sorrow and distress, I have had to serve my masters. Luckily, my crown had fallen off in the water, so I was not known to be the Queen; but till you came, Jack, I had almost forgotten that I had ever been happy and free, and I had hardly any hope of getting away.""",course drown oblige lie have power own element next day town person come net drag river pick meshe make slave foot fairy get day sorrow distress have serve master crown fall water know come forget happy free have hope get 
18,"""How sorry your people must have been,"" said Jack, ""when they found you did not come home again.""",sorry person say find come 
19,"""No,"" said the Queen: ""they only went to sleep, and they will not wake till to-morrow morning, when I pass in again. They will think I have been absent for a day, and so will the apple-woman. You must not undeceive them; if you do, they will be very angry.""",say go sleep wake morning pass think absent day apple woman undeceive do angry 
20,"""And who is the apple-woman?"" inquired Jack; but the Queen blushed, and pretended not to hear the question, so he repeated,--",apple woman inquire blush pretend hear question repeat 
21,"""Queen, who is the apple-woman?""",apple woman 
22,"""I've only had her for a very little while,"" said the Queen, evasively.",have little while say 
23,"""And how long do you think you have been a slave. Queen?"" asked Jack.",think slave ask 
24,"""I don't know,"" said the Queen. ""I have never been able to make up my mind about that.""",know say able make mind 
25,"And now all the moons began to shine, and all the trees lighted themselves up, for almost every leaf had a glowworm or a fire-fly on it, and the water was full of fishes that had shining eyes. And now they were close to the steep mountain side; and Jack looked and saw an opening in it, into which the river ran. It was a kind of cave, something like a long, long church with a vaulted roof, only the pavement of it was that magic river, and a narrow towing-path ran on either side.",moon begin shine tree light leaf have glowworm fire fly water full fish have shine eye close steep mountain side look see opening river run kind cave long long church vault roof pavement magic river narrow towing path run side 
26,"As they entered the cave there was a hollow, murmuring sound, and the Queen's crown became so bright that it lighted up the whole boat; at the same time she began to tell Jack a wonderful story, which he liked very much to hear, but every fresh thing she said he forgot what had gone before; and at last, though he tried very hard to listen, he was obliged to go to sleep; and he slept soundly, and never dreamed of anything, till it was morning.",enter cave be hollow murmure sound crown become bright light whole boat same time begin tell wonderful story like much hear fresh thing say forget go last try hard listen oblige go sleep sleep dream morning 
27,"He saw such a curious sight when he woke! They had been going through this underground cavern all night, and now they were approaching its opening on the other side. This opening, because they were a good way from it yet, looked like a lovely little round window of blue and yellow and green glass, but as they drew on he could see far-off mountains, blue sky, and a country all covered with sunshine.",see curious sight wake go underground cavern night approach opening other side opening good way look lovely little round window blue yellow green glass draw see mountain blue sky country cover sunshine 
28,"He heard singing, too, such as fairies make; and he saw some beautiful people, such as those fairies whom he had brought with him. They were coming along the towing-path. They were all lady fairies; but they were not very polite, for as each one came up she took a silken rope out of a brown sailor's hand, and gave him a shove which pushed him into the water. In fact, the water became filled with such swarms of these sailors that the boat could hardly get on. But the poor little brown fellows did not seem to mind this conduct, for they plunged and shook themselves about, scattering a good deal of spray. Then they all suddenly dived, and when they came up again they were ducks,--nothing but brown ducks, I assure you, with green stripes on their wings; and with a great deal of quacking and floundering, they all began to swim back again as fast as they could.",hear sing such fairy make see beautiful person such fairy bring come towing path lady fairy polite one come take silken rope brown sailor hand give shove push water fact water become fill such swarm sailor boat get poor little brown fellow seem mind conduct plunge shake scatter good deal spray dive come duck brown duck assure green stripe wing great deal quacking flounder begin swim 
29,"Then Jack was a good deal vexed, and he said to himself, ""If nobody thanks the ducks for towing us I will""; so he stood up in the boat and shouted, ""Thank you, ducks; we are very much obliged to you!"" But neither the Queen nor these new towers took the least notice, and gradually the boat came out of that dim cave and entered Fairyland, while the river became so narrow that you could hear the song of the towers quite easily; those on the right bank sang the first verse, and those on the left bank answered:--",good deal vex say thank duck towing stand boat shout thank duck oblige new tower take least notice boat come dim cave enter river become narrow hear song tower right bank sing first verse left bank answer 
30,"  Drop, drop from the leaves of lign aloes,     O honey-dew! drop from the tree.   Float up through your clear river shallows,     White lilies, beloved of the bee.",drop drop leave lign aloe honey dew drop tree float clear river shallow white lilie beloved bee 
31,"  Let the people, O Queen! say, and bless thee,     Her bounty drops soft as the dew,   And spotless in honor confess thee,     As lilies are spotless in hue.",let person say bless bounty drop soft dew spotless honor confess lilie spotless hue 
32,"  On the roof stands yon white stork awaking,     His feathers flush rosy the while,   For, lo! from the blushing east breaking,     The sun sheds the bloom of his smile.",roof stand white stork awake feather flush rosy while blush east breaking sun shed bloom smile 
33,"  Let them boast of thy word, ""It is certain;     We doubt it no more,"" let them say,   ""Than to-morrow that night's dusky curtain     Shall roll back its folds for the day.""",let boast word certain doubt let say night dusky curtain roll fold day 
34,"""Master,"" whispered the old hound, who was lying at Jack's feet.",master whisper old hound lie foot 
35,"""Well,"" said Jack.",say 
36,"""They didn't invent that song themselves,"" said the hound; ""the old apple-woman taught it to them,--the woman whom they love because she can make them cry.""",invent song say hound old apple woman teach woman love make cry 
37,"Jack was rather ashamed of the hound's rudeness in saying this; but the Queen took no notice. And now they had reached a little landing-place, which ran out a few feet into the river, and was strewed thickly with cowslips and violets.",ashamed hound rudeness say take notice reach little landing place run few foot river strew cowslip violet 
38,[THE QUEEN.,
39,"""Here the boat stopped, and the Queen rose and got out.""--PAGE 114.]",boat stop rise get page 
40,"Here the boat stopped, and the Queen rose and got out.",boat stop rise get 
41,"Jack watched her. A whole crowd of one-foot-one fairies came down a garden to meet her, and he saw them conduct her to a beautiful tent, with golden poles and a silken covering; but nobody took the slightest notice of him, or of little Mopsa, or of the hound, and after a long silence the hound said, ""Well, master, don't you feel hungry? Why don't you go with the others and have some breakfast?""",watch whole crowd foot fairy come garden meet see conduct beautiful tent golden pole silken covering take slight notice little hound long silence hound say master feel hungry go other have breakfast 
42,"""The Queen didn't invite me,"" said Jack.",invite say 
43,"""But do you feel as if you couldn't go?"" asked the hound.",feel go ask hound 
44,"""Of course not,"" answered Jack; ""but perhaps I may not.""",course answer 
45,"""Oh, yes, master,"" replied the hound; ""whatever you _can_ do in Fairyland you _may_ do.""",master reply hound do do 
46,"""Are you sure of that?"" asked Jack.",sure ask 
47,"""Quite sure, master,"" said the hound; ""and I am hungry too.""",sure master say hound hungry 
48,"""Well,"" said Jack, ""I will go there and take Mopsa. She shall ride on my shoulder; you may follow.""",say go take ride shoulder follow 
49,"So he walked up that beautiful garden till he came to the great tent. A banquet was going on inside. All the one-foot-one fairies sat down the sides of the table, and at the top sat the Queen on a larger chair; and there were two empty chairs, one on each side of her.",walk beautiful garden come great tent banquet go foot fairy sit side table top sit large chair be empty chair side 
50,"Jack blushed; but the hound whispering again, ""Master, whatever you can do you may do,"" he came slowly up the table towards the Queen, who was saying, as he drew near, ""Where is our trusty and well-beloved, the apple-woman?"" And she took no notice of Jack; so, though he could not help feeling rather red and ashamed, he went and sat in the chair beside her with Mopsa still on his shoulder. Mopsa laughed for joy when she saw the feast. The Queen said, ""O Jack, I am so glad to see you!"" and some of the one-foot-one fairies cried out, ""What a delightful little creature that is! She can laugh! Perhaps she can also cry!""",blush hound whisper master do do come table say draw trusty beloved apple woman take notice help feel red ashamed go sit chair shoulder laugh joy see feast say glad see foot fairy cry delightful little creature laugh cry 
51,"Jack looked about, but there was no seat for Mopsa; and he was afraid to let her run about on the floor, lest she should be hurt.",look be seat afraid let run floor hurt 
52,"There was a very large dish standing before the Queen; for though the people were small, the plates and dishes were exactly like those we use, and of the same size.",be large dish stand person small plate dish use same size 
53,"This dish was raised on a foot, and filled with grapes and peaches. Jack wondered at himself for doing it, but he saw no other place for Mopsa; so he took out the fruit, laid it round the dish, and set his own little one-foot-one in the dish.",dish raise foot fill grape peach wonder do see other place take fruit lay dish set own little foot dish 
54,"Nobody looked in the least surprised; and there she sat very happily, biting an apple with her small white teeth.",look least surprise sit bite apple small white tooth 
55,"Then, as they brought him nothing to eat, Jack helped himself from some of the dishes before him, and found that a fairy breakfast was very nice indeed.",bring eat help dish find fairy breakfast nice 
56,"In the meantime there was a noise outside, and in stumped an elderly woman. She had very thick boots on, a short gown of red print, an orange cotton handkerchief over her shoulders, and a black silk bonnet. She was exactly the same height as the Queen,--for of course nobody in Fairyland is allowed to be any bigger than the Queen; so, if they are not children when they arrive, they are obliged to shrink.",meantime be noise stump elderly woman have thick boot short gown red print orange cotton handkerchief shoulder black silk bonnet same height course allow big child arrive oblige shrink 
57,"""How are you, dear?"" said the Queen.",dear say 
58,"""I am as well as can be expected,"" answered the apple-woman, sitting down in the empty chair. ""Now, then, where's my tea? They're never ready with my cup of tea.""",expect answer apple woman sit empty chair tea ready cup tea 
59,"Two attendants immediately brought a cup of tea, and set it down before the apple-woman, with a plate of bread and butter; and she proceeded to pour it into the saucer, and blow it, because it was hot. In so doing her wandering eyes caught sight of Jack and little Mopsa, and she set down the saucer, and looked at them with attention.",attendant bring cup tea set apple woman plate bread butter proceed pour saucer blow hot do wonder eye catch sight little set saucer look attention 
60,"Now Mopsa, I am sorry to say, was behaving so badly that Jack was quite ashamed of her. First, she got out of her dish, took something nice out of the Queen's plate with her fingers, and ate it; and then, as she was going back, she tumbled over a melon, and upset a glass of red wine, which she wiped up with her white frock; after which she got into her dish again, and there she sat smiling, and daubing her pretty face with a piece of buttered muffin.",sorry say behave ashamed get dish take nice plate finger eat go tumble melon upset glass red wine wipe white frock get dish sit smile daub pretty face piece butter muffin 
61,"""Mopsa,"" said Jack, ""you are very naughty; if you behave in this way, I shall never take you out to parties again.""",say naughty behave way take party 
62,"""Pretty lamb!"" said the apple-woman; ""It's just like a child."" And then she burst into tears, and exclaimed, sobbing, ""It's many a long day since I've seen a child. Oh dear! oh deary me!""",lamb say apple woman child burst tear exclaim sobb many long day see child dear 
63,"Upon this, to the astonishment of Jack, every one of the guests began to cry and sob too.",astonishment guest begin cry sob 
64,"""Oh dear! oh dear!"" they said to one another, ""we're crying; we can cry just as well as men and women. Isn't it delightful? What a luxury it is to cry, to be sure!""",dear dear say cry cry man woman delightful luxury cry sure 
65,"They were evidently quite proud of it; and when Jack looked at the Queen for an explanation, she only gave him a still little smile.",proud look explanation give little smile 
66,"But Mopsa crept along the table to the apple-woman, let her take her and hug her, and seemed to like her very much; for as she sat on her knee, she patted her brown face with a little dimpled hand.",creep table apple woman let take hug seem like sit knee patt brown face little dimple hand 
67,"""I should like vastly well to be her nurse,"" said the apple-woman, drying her eyes, and looking at Jack.",like nurse say apple woman drying eye look 
68,"""If you'll always wash her, and put clean frocks on her, you may,"" said Jack; ""for just look at her,--what a figure she is already!""",wash put clean frock say look figure 
69,"Upon this the apple-woman laughed for joy, and again every one else did the same. The fairies can only laugh and cry when they see mortals do so.",apple woman laugh joy one do same fairy laugh cry see mortal do
