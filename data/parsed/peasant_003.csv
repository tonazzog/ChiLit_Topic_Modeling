1,CHAPTER 3. A HOLIDAY MORNING.,chapter holiday morning 
2,"The boys were wakened in the morning by a rap on the door, like that of the preceding evening.  When they had rubbed their eyes and got up, they found that their mother was speaking with no less a person than the bailiff from the chateau.  It took little time to slip on the only day garment each had: and then, as their mother stood in the doorway, one looked out under each of her arms, to see what was going on.",boy waken morning rap door preced evening rub eye get find mother speak person bailiff chateau take little time slip only day garment have mother stand doorway look arm see go 
3,"""Ah!  You little fellows,"" said the bailiff, ""I have some business with you.  What have you to do with pigeons, when you know 'tis against the law for you to keep them?  Come, no excuses; I saw a brood of pigeons on the ridge of the roof, as I came.""",little fellow say bailiff have business have do pigeon know law keep come excuse see brood pigeon ridge roof come 
4,"""How are we to help the Count's pigeons lighting on our ridge, if they choose, please sir!"" said Marc.",help count pigeon light ridge choose sir say 
5,"""Nay, Marc, no tricks!"" said his mother.  ""The pigeons are theirs, sir; got from the wood, and a present for their sister: but you see, sir, how trickery and falsehood come.  If there were no reasons why my boys should not do such an innocent thing as bring up a brood of pigeons, the thought of an untruth would not enter their heads; but you see what you tempt them to, by driving them so very hard about almost the only pleasure they have.""",trick say mother pigeon sir get wood present sister see sir trickery falsehood come be reason boy do innocent thing bring brood pigeon thought untruth enter head see temp drive only pleasure have 
6,"""It is not I, good woman,"" said the bailiff.  ""Do not say I drive them hard--I did not make the laws; but it is my business to see that the laws are regarded between the Count and his people, that is all.  Come! While your daughter puts on her gayest ribbon, I will go round, and see about these pigeons.""",good woman say bailiff say drive make law business see law regard person come daughter put gayest ribbon go see pigeon 
7,"Marie had no gay ribbon to put on, though she must go immediately with her father before the Count.  It was the bailiffs errand to say this. While she made herself as neat as she could, and her father was called in from the field (to which he had gone straight from the ponds, because he knew there was no meal ready for him at home), the bailiff examined the premises, followed at a distance by the boys, in terror for their rabbit-hutch.  Of course, the rabbits were found; and of course, they were carried off.  Robin rolled upon the ground in his grief, and Marc looked as if his heart was bursting.  The bailiff was so sorry for what he felt it his duty to do, that against all rule he offered the boys one young rabbit and one young pigeon to keep.  At first, these were accepted; but Robin was sure that Marc's rabbit would pine alone; and Marc was certain Robin's pigeon could never live solitary; and they gave up these last remains of their treasures.  To do it with a good grace was more than they were equal to; and when Marie and her father set off for the chateau, they left the boys crying bitterly.",have gay ribbon put go father count bailiff errand say make neat father call field go pond know be meal ready home bailiff examine premise follow distance boy terror rabbit hutch course rabbit find course carry roll ground grief look heart burst bailiff sorry feel duty do rule offer boy young rabbit young pigeon keep accept sure rabbit pine certain pigeon live solitary give last remains treasure do good grace more equal father set chateau leave boy cry 
8,"It did not make Marie the more easy to see her lover skulking at a distance, all the way they went.  The bailiff was close at hand; and she believed that his quick eyes would note all Charles's doings.  Every time he spoke, which he did frequently and civilly, she dreaded his asking what business that man had, watching them from under the shade of the wood; but each time she was relieved by hearing some question or remark about the reception of the Dauphiness in the village.  She had to say all that must be said to the bailiff; for her father was busy thinking.  He was glad when they were left alone, so that he could tell Marie what was in his mind.  There was time enough to do this.  When the great iron gates of the avenue closed behind them, the bailiff told them to go straight on by the broad road.  He was going by a side path, but would meet them farther on, and take them to the Count.",make easy see lover skulk distance way go bailiff close hand believe quick eye note doing time speak do dread ask business man have watch shade wood time relieve hear question remark reception village have say say bailiff father busy think glad leave alone tell mind be time do great iron gate avenue close bailiff tell go broad road go side path meet take count 
9,"This was the opportunity Randolphe wanted, to tell his daughter that he thought it best now to ask the Count's consent to her marriage with Charles, formally and properly.  Marie trembled, and grew sick at heart as she heard this, and implored her father not to mention Charles,--so sure was she that her marriage would be prevented if Charles were spoken of.  Her father declared, however, that he knew the Count and his ways, and was certain that, his notice being attracted, nothing could now prevent his becoming acquainted with the minutest of their family circumstances; and that the most politic course would be to appear to desire his consent, and only to have waited his arrival at the chateau to request it.  Randolphe had decided upon his plan, and Marie had only to submit.",opportunity want tell daughter think good ask consent marriage tremble grow sick heart hear implore father mention sure marriage prevent speak father declare know way certain notice attract prevent become acquainted minutest family circumstance politic course appear desire consent wait arrival chateau request decide plan have submit 
10,"The bailiff met them at the head of the avenue, and led them to the morning apartment of the Count, which he entered first, after being announced, leaving his companions in the hall.  The door was presently opened, and he beckoned them in.",bailiff meet head avenue lead morning apartment enter announce leave companion hall door open beckon 
11,"The Count was sitting in his morning gown beside a table, on which stood a small silver tray, with his coffee-cup upon it.  His valet was dressing his hair.  Two of his sons were in the room; one playing with his dogs in a recess of the window, and the other reading the newspaper.",sit morning gown table stand small silver tray coffee cup valet dress hair son room play dog recess window other read newspaper 
12,"""Come closer,"" said the Count, in answer to Randolphe's bow.  ""Nearer-- come close up to the table.""",come close say answer bow come table 
13,"The truth was, he could not otherwise see them well while his hair was in the hands of his valet.",truth see hair hand valet 
14,"""Is it possible?"" he said, as if to himself, while he looked at the peasant and his daughter.  ""Are you Randolphe?  I had heard your name for so long and so often, among my people, that I had imagined you one of the principal of them.  But you appear wretchedly poor, eh?"" he continued, looking into the sallow, unshaven face before him.  ""I am afraid you are very poor, eh?""",possible say look peasant daughter hear name person imagine principal appear poor continue look sallow unshaven face afraid poor 
15,"""Well-nigh heart-broken with poverty, my lord.""",nigh heart break poverty lord 
16,"""There is some mistake,"" resumed the Count.  ""How is this?"" said he, looking towards the bailiff; and then, calling to his son in the window, ""Casimir, how is this?""",be mistake resume count say look bailiff call son window 
17,The bailiff answered first:--,bailiff answer 
18,"""Randolphe is wretchedly poor, my lord, as you say; but there is no one of your people hereabouts who is less so.""",poor lord say be person hereabout 
19,"The youth's reply was, that in the question of arrangements for receiving the Dauphiness, he supposed the principal peasants belonging to the chateau would be spoken to; and he had mentioned Randolphe, understanding him to be one of them.",youth reply question arrangement receive suppose principal peasant belong chateau speak mention understand 
20,"Marie saw that this youth was the one who had stared her out of countenance at the stile, the afternoon before: the same who had talked with her brothers on the verge of the wood.",see youth one stare countenance stile afternoon same talk brother verge wood 
21,"The Count was for dismissing his visitors at once, saying that they would not answer his purpose for the arrangements of which he had meant to speak with them.  They were not, however, let off so easily as they had now begun to hope.  The young man asked some questions from the window, which put it into the Count's head to ask more, till Randolphe thought it prudent not to keep back his story, but to request the Count's consent to Marie's marriage, as if that had been his own part of his errand this morning.",count dismiss visitor say answer purpose arrangement mean speak let begin hope young man ask question window put head ask more think prudent keep story request consent marriage own part errand morning 
22,"The Count evidently cared nothing about the matter, and would have given his consent as a matter of course, if his son Casimir had been anywhere but in the room.  As it was, there were so many questions, the inquiries about Charles were so minute, that Marie grew vexed and angry, and by a look invited her father to say something about the Count's time and be gone.  The youth who was reading certainly pitied her, for he said, without raising his eyes from his newspaper,--",care matter give consent matter course son room be many question inquiry minute grow vexed angry look invite father say time gone youth read pity say raise eye newspaper 
23,"""Be quiet, Casimir.  Casimir, how can you?  Do leave these poor people to make themselves happy their own way.  It is no concern of yours.""",quiet leave poor person make happy own way concern 
24,"""It is my father's concern that his people should not live on his land when they cannot do service for it.  Why, it appears they have not anything like a cottage to go to.  My father cannot look to them for anything.  You see, sir, you can depend upon them for nothing, in their present circumstances: and I do not see how you can consent to their marrying yet.  If this fellow Charles, now, would do his duty, and serve for three years, there would be some chance for their settling comfortably afterwards.  They would lose nothing by waiting, if they settled comfortably at last.""",father concern person live land do service appear have cottage go father look see sir depend present circumstance see consent marrying fellow do duty serve year be chance settling lose wait settle last 
25,"""Please your lordship,"" said Randolphe, in a hoarse voice, ""they have waited so very long already, and there is no prospect--""",lordship say hoarse voice wait be prospect 
26,"He glanced at Marie to see how she bore this.  She seemed to be just falling; and he drew her arm within his, to keep her up.",glance see bear seem fall draw arm keep 
27,"""We will take care that there is a prospect,"" said Casimir.  ""We do not intend to lose sight of you.  We may do some kind things for Marie.""",take care be prospect say intend lose sight do kind thing 
28,"Marie tried to speak; but before she could utter a sentence, the Count discovered that the valet had arrived at the last bow of the pig-tail, and that he must make a decision, and conclude this interview.  He therefore pronounced that Charles should be sent on military service for three years, and gave orders to the bailiff to see that the young man was brought in for the purpose, in the course of the morning.  He then bade good-day to his peasant dependent, and hoped he would see better times, and do the best he could for the young people before their wedding-day, as he would now have a considerable interval in which to meditate his duty as a parent to so pretty a daughter.",try speak utter sentence discover valet arrive last bow pig-tail make decision conclude interview pronounce send military service year give order bailiff see young man bring purpose course morning bid good day peasant dependent hope see good time do good young person wedding day have considerable interval meditate duty parent daughter 
29,"While the Count was saying this, Casimir slipped round towards the door, and, as Marie passed near him, thrust a piece of gold into her hand. Marie had never had a piece of gold in her hand before, and she did not like it now.  She looked at Casimir with such a look as he had never before met from human eyes, and threw his gift between his two dogs in the window.",say slip door pass thrust piece gold hand have piece gold hand like look look meet human eye throw gift dog window 
30,"The Count did not see nor heed this.  Randolphe thought his graver son did; for there was a sudden crackle of the newspaper, and the reader's face was crimson to the temples.",count see heed think graver son be sudden crackle newspaper reader face crimson temple 
31,"""We have one friend there, I fancy,"" muttered the unhappy father, as he went out.  ""But for that, I think you and I had better drown ourselves in the ponds between this and home.""",have friend fancy mutter unhappy father go think good drown pond home 
32,"""Charles!"" gasped Marie in his ear.  ""Send Charles away!  I can get home alone.""",gasp ear send get 
33,"Her father took the hint.  They parted in the shade of the avenue, as soon as they could suppose themselves unwatched from the chateau. Randolphe cut across into the wood where he had seen Charles half an hour before, while Marie went homewards with tottering steps, looking away from the ponds, from a feeling that her state of mind was too desperate for her to trust herself on the brink of deep waters.",father take hint part shade avenue suppose unwatch chateau cut wood see hour go homeward totter step look pond feeling state mind desperate trust brink deep water
