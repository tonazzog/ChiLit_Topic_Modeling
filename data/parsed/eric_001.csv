3,"""Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"" cried a young boy, as he capered vigorously about, and clapped his hands. ""Papa and mamma will be home in a week now, and then we shall stay here a little time, and _then_, and _then_, I shall go to school.""",hurrah cry young boy caper clapp hand mamma week stay little time go school 
4,"The last words were enunciated with immense importance, as he stopped his impromptu dance before the chair where his sober cousin Fanny was patiently working at her crochet; but she did not look so much affected by the announcement as the boy seemed to demand, so he again exclaimed, ""And then, Miss Fanny, I shall go to school.""",last word enunciate immense importance stop impromptu dance chair sober cousin work crochet look affect announcement boy seem demand exclaim go school

6,"""O ay, Fanny, that's just like you to say so; you're always talking and prophesying; but never mind, I'm going to school, so hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!"" and he again began his capering,--jumping over the chairs, trying to vault the tables, singing and dancing with an exuberance of delight, till, catching a sudden sight of his little spaniel Flo, he sprang through the open window into the garden, and disappeared behind the trees of the shrubbery; but Fanny still heard his clear, ringing, silvery laughter, as he continued his games in the summer air.",say talk prophesy mind go school begin capering jump chair try vault table sing dance exuberance delight catching sudden sight little spaniel spring open window garden disappear tree shrubbery hear clear ring silvery laughter continue game summer air 
7,"She looked up from her work after he had gone, and sighed. In spite of the sunshine and balm of the bright weather, a sense of heaviness and foreboding oppressed her. Everything looked smiling and beautiful, and there was an almost irresistible contagion in the mirth of her young cousin, but still she could not help feeling sad. It was not merely that she would have to part with Eric, ""but that bright boy,"" thought Fanny, ""what will become of him? I have heard strange things of schools; oh, if he should be spoilt and ruined, what misery it would be. Those baby lips, that pure young heart, a year may work sad change in their words and thoughts!"" She sighed again, and her eyes glistened as she raised them upwards, and breathed a silent prayer.",look work go sigh spite sunshine balm bright weather sense heaviness foreboding oppress look smile beautiful be irresistible contagion mirth young cousin help feel sad have part bright boy think become hear strange thing school spoil ruin misery baby lip pure young heart year work sad change word thought sigh eye glisten raise breathe silent prayer 
8,"She loved the boy dearly, and had taught him from his earliest years. In most things she found him an apt pupil. Truthful, ingenuous, quick, he would acquire almost without effort any subject that interested him, and a word was often enough to bring the impetuous blood to his cheeks, in a flush, of pride or indignation. He required the gentlest teaching, and had received it, while his mind seemed cast in such a mould of stainless honor that he avoided most of the faults to which children are prone. But he was far from blameless. He was proud to a fault; he well knew that few of his fellows had gifts like his, either of mind or person, and his fair face often showed a clear impression of his own superiority. His passion, too, was imperious, and though it always met with prompt correction, his cousin had latterly found it difficult to subdue. She felt, in a word, that he was outgrowing her rule. Beyond a certain age no boy of spirit can be safely guided by a woman's hand alone.",love boy teach early year most thing find apt pupil truthful ingenuous quick acquire effort subject interest word enough bring impetuous blood cheek flush pride indignation require gentlest teaching receive mind seem cast mould stainless honor avoid most fault child prone blameless proud fault know few fellow have gift mind person fair face show clear impression own superiority passion imperious meet prompt correction cousin find difficult subdue feel word outgrow rule certain age boy spirit guide woman hand 
9,"Eric Williams was now twelve years old. His father was a civilian in India, and was returning on furlough to England after a long absence. Eric had been born in India, but had been sent to England by his parents at an early age, in charge of a lady friend of his mother. The parting, which had been agony to his father and mother, he was too young to feel; indeed the moment itself passed by without his being conscious of it. They took him on board the ship, and, after a time, gave him a hammer and some nails to play with. These had always been to him a supreme delight, and while he hammered away, Mr. and Mrs. Williams, denying themselves, for the child's sake, even one more tearful embrace, went ashore in the boat and left him. It was not till the ship sailed that he was told he would not see them again for a long, long time. Poor child, his tears and cries were wild when he first understood it; but the sorrows of four years old are very transient, and before a week was over, little Eric felt almost reconciled to his position, and had become the universal pet and plaything of every one on board, from Captain Broadland down to the cabin boy, with whom he very soon struck up an acquaintance. Yet twice a day at least, he would shed a tear, as he lisped his little prayer, kneeling at Mrs. Munro's knee, and asked God ""to bless his dear dear father and mother, and make him a good boy.""",year old father civilian return furlough long absence bear send parent early age charge lady friend mother parting agony father mother young feel moment pass conscious take board ship time give hammer nail play supreme delight hammer deny child sake tearful embrace go boat leave ship sail tell see long long time poor child tear cry wild understand sorrow year old transient week little feel reconcile position become universal pet plaything one board cabin boy strike acquaintance day least shed tear lisp little prayer kneel knee ask bless dear dear father mother make good boy 
10,"When Eric arrived in England, he was intrusted to the care of a widowed aunt, whose daughter, Fanny, had the main charge of his early teaching. At first, the wayward little Indian seemed likely to form no accession to the quiet household, but he soon became its brightest ornament and pride. Everything was in his favor at the pleasant home of Mrs. Trevor. He was treated with motherly kindness and tenderness, yet firmly checked when he went wrong. From the first he had a well-spring of strength, against temptation, in the long letters which every mail brought from his parents; and all his childish affections were entwined round the fancied image of a brother born since he had left India. In his bed-room there hung a cherub's head, drawn in pencil by his mother, and this picture was inextricably identified in his imagination with his ""little brother Vernon."" He loved it dearly, and whenever he went astray, nothing weighed on his mind so strongly as the thought, that if he were naughty he would teach little Vernon to be naughty too when he came home.",arrive intrust care widow aunt daughter have main charge early teaching wayward little seem likely form accession quiet household become brightest ornament pride favor pleasant home treat motherly kindness tenderness check go wrong first have spring strength temptation long letter mail bring parent childish affection entwine fancy image brother bear leave bed room hang cherub head draw pencil mother picture identify imagination little brother love go astray weigh mind thought naughty teach little naughty come 
11,"And Nature also--wisest, gentlest, holiest of teachers-was with him in his childhood. Fairholm Cottage, where his aunt lived, was situated in the beautiful Vale of Ayrton, and a clear stream ran through the valley at the bottom of Mrs. Trevor's orchard. Eric loved this stream, and was always happy as he roamed by its side, or over the low green hills and scattered dingles, which lent unusual loveliness to every winding of its waters. He was allowed to go about a good deal by himself, and it did him good. He grew up fearless and self-dependent, and never felt the want of amusement. The garden and orchard supplied him a theatre for endless games and romps, sometimes with no other companion than his cousin and his dog, and sometimes with the few children of his own age whom he knew in the hamlet. Very soon he forgot all about India; it only hung like a distant golden haze on the horizon of his memory. When asked if he remembered it, he would say thoughtfully, that in dreams and at some other times, he saw a little child, with long curly hair, running about in a little garden, near a great river, in a place where the air was very bright. But whether the little boy was himself or his brother Vernon, whom he had never seen, he couldn't quite tell.",wisest gentlest holy teacher childhood aunt live situate beautiful clear stream run valley bottom orchard love stream happy roam side low green hill scatter dingle loan unusual loveliness wind water allow go good deal do good grow fearless self dependent feel want amusement garden orchard supply theatre endless game romp other companion cousin dog few child own age know hamlet forget hang distant golden haze horizon memory ask remember say dream other time see little child long curly hair run little garden great river place air bright little boy brother see tell 
12,"But above all, it was happy for Eric that his training was religious and enlightened. With Mrs. Trevor and her daughter, religion was not a system but a habit--not a theory, but a continued act of life. All was simple, sweet, and unaffected about their charity and their devotions. They loved God, and they did all the good they could to those around them. The floating gossip and ill-nature of the little village never affected them; it melted away insensibly in the presence of their cultivated minds; and so friendship with them was a bond of union among all, and from the vicar to the dairyman every one loved and respected them, asked their counsel, and sought their sympathy.",happy training religious enlightened daughter religion system habit theory continue act life simple sweet unaffected charity devotion love do good float gossip ill nature little village affect melt presence cultivate mind friendship bond union vicar dairyman one love respect ask counsel seek sympathy 
13,"They called themselves by no sectarian name, nor could they have told to what ""party"" they belonged. They troubled themselves with no theories of education, but mingled gentle nurture with ""wholesome neglect."" There was nothing exotic or constrained in the growth of Eric's character. He was not one of your angelically good children at all, and knew none of the phrases of which infant prodigies are supposed to be so fond. He had not been taught any distinction between ""Sunday books"" and ""week-day"" books, but no book had been put in his way that was not healthy and genuine in tone. He had not been told that he might use his Noah's ark on Sunday, because it was ""a Sunday plaything,"" while all other toys were on that day forbidden. Of these things the Trevors thought little; they only saw that no child could be happy in enforced idleness or constrained employment; and so Eric grew up to love Sunday quite as well as any other day in the week, though, unlike your angelic children, he never professed to like it better. But to be truthful, to be honest, to be kind, to be brave, these had been taught him, and he never _quite_ forgot the lesson; nor amid the sorrows of after life did he ever quite lose the sense--learnt at dear quiet Fairholm--of a present loving God, of a tender and long-suffering Father.",call sectarian name tell party belong trouble theory education mingle gentle nurture wholesome neglect be exotic constrain growth character good child know phrase infant prodigy suppose fond teach distinction book week day book book put way healthy genuine tone tell use ark plaything other toy day forbidden thing think little see child happy enforce idleness constrain employment grow love other day week angelic child profess like good truthful honest kind brave teach forget lesson sorrow life lose sense learn dear quiet present love tender long suffering father 
14,"As yet he could be hardly said to know what school was. He had been sent indeed to Mr. Lawley's grammar-school for the last half-year, and had learned a few declensions in his Latin grammar. But as Mr. Lawley allowed his upper class to hear the little boys their lessons, Eric had managed to get on pretty much as he liked. Only _once_ in the entire half-year had he said a lesson to the dreadful master himself, and of course it was a ruinous failure, involving some tremendous pulls of Eric's hair, and making him tremble like a leaf. Several things combined to make Mr. Lawley dreadful to his imagination. Ever since he was quite little, he remembered hearing the howls which proceeded from the ""Latin school"" as he passed by, whilst some luckless youngster was getting caned; and the reverend pedagogue was notoriously passionate. Then, again, he spoke so indistinctly with his deep, gruff voice, that Eric never could and never did syllable a word he said, and this kept him in a perpetual terror. Once Mr. Lawley had told him to go out, and see what time it was by the church clock. Only hearing that he was to do something, too frightened to ask what it was, and feeling sure that even if he did, he should not understand what the master said, Eric ran out, went straight to Mr. Lawley's house, and after having managed by strenuous jumps to touch the knocker, informed the servant ""that Mr. Lawley wanted his man.""",say know school send grammar school last half year learn few declension latin grammar allow upper class hear little boy lesson manage get like _once_ entire half year say lesson dreadful master course ruinous failure involve tremendous pull hair make tremble leaf several thing combine make dreadful imagination little remember hear howl proceed latin school pass luckless youngster cane reverend pedagogue passionate speak deep gruff voice do syllable word say keep perpetual terror tell go see time church clock hear do frighten ask feel sure understand master say run go house manage strenuous jump touch knocker inform servant want man 
15,"""What man?"" said the maid-servant, ""the young man? or the butler? or is it the clerk?""",man say maid servant young man butler clerk 
16,"Here was a puzzler! all Eric knew was that he was in the habit of sending sometimes for one or the other of these functionaries; but he was in for it, so with a faltering voice he said ""the young man"" at hazard, and went back to the Latin school.",puzzler know habit send other functionary falter voice say young man hazard go latin school 
17,"""Why have you been so long?"" roared Mr. Lawley, as he timidly entered. Fear entirely prevented Eric from hearing what was said, so he answered at random, ""He's coming, sir."" The master, seeing by his scared look that something was wrong, waited to see what would turn up.",long roar enter fear prevent hear say answer random come sir master see scared look wrong wait see turn 
18,"Soon after, in walked ""the young man,"" and coming to the astonished Mr. Lawley, bowed, scraped, and said, ""Master Williams said you sent for me, sir.""",walk young man come astonished bow scrape say say send sir 
19,"""A mistake,"" growled the schoolmaster, turning on Eric a look which nearly petrified him; he quite expected a book at his head, or at best a great whack of the cane; but Mr. Lawley had naturally a kind heart, soured as it was, and pitying perhaps the child's white face, he contented himself with the effects of his look.",mistake growl schoolmaster turn look petrify expect book head good great whack cane have kind heart soure pity child white face content effect look 
20,"The simple truth was, that poor Mr. Lawley was a little wrong in the head. A scholar and a gentleman, early misfortunes and an imprudent marriage had driven him to the mastership of the little country grammar-school; and here the perpetual annoyance caused to his refined mind by the coarseness of clumsy or spiteful boys, had gradually unhinged his intellect. Often did he tell the boys ""that it was an easier life by far to break stones by the roadside than to teach them;"" and at last his eccentricities became too obvious to be any longer overlooked.",simple truth poor little wrong head scholar gentleman early misfortune imprudent marriage drive mastership little country grammar school perpetual annoyance cause refine mind coarseness clumsy spiteful boy unhinge intellect tell boy easy life break stone roadside teach last eccentricity become obvious overlook 
21,"The dénouement of his history was a tragic one, and had come a few days before the time when, our narrative opens. It was a common practice among the Latin school boys, as I suppose among all boys, to amuse themselves by putting a heavy book on the top of a door left partially ajar, and to cry out ""Crown him"" as the first luckless youngster who happened to come in received the book thundering on his head. One day, just as the trap had been adroitly laid, Mr. Lawley walked in unexpectedly. The moment he entered the school-room, down came an Ainsworth's Dictionary on the top of his hat, and the boy, concealed behind the door, unconscious of who the victim was, enunciated with mock gravity, ""Crown him! three cheers.""",dénouement history tragic one come few day time narrative open common practice latin school boy suppose boy amuse put heavy book top door leave ajar cry crown first luckless youngster happen come receive book thunder head day trap lay walk moment enter school room come top hat boy conceal door unconscious victim enunciate mock gravity cheer 
22,"It took Mr. Lawley a second to raise from his eyebrows the battered hat, and recover from his confusion; the next instant he was springing after the boy who had caused the mishap, and who, knowing the effects of the master's fury, fled with precipitation. In one minute the offender was caught, and Mr. Lawley's heavy hand fell recklessly on his ears and back, until he screamed with terror. At last by a tremendous writhe, wrenching himself free, he darted towards the door, and Mr. Lawley, too exhausted to pursue, snatched his large gold watch out of his fob, and hurled it at the boy's retreating figure. The watch flew through the air;--crash! it had missed its aim, and, striking the wall above the lintel, fell smashed into a thousand shivers.",take second raise eyebrow batter hat recover confusion next instant spring boy cause mishap know effect master fury flead precipitation minute offender catch heavy hand fall ear scream terror last tremendous writhe wrench free dart door exhaust pursue snatch large gold watch fob hurl boy retreat figure watch fly air crash miss aim strike wall lintel fall smash shiver 
23,"The sound, the violence of the action, the sight of the broken watch, which was the gift of a cherished friend, instantly woke the master to his senses. The whole school had seen it; they sate there pale and breathless with excitement and awe. The poor man could bear it no longer. He flung himself into his chair, hid his face with his hands, and burst into hysterical tears. It was the outbreak of feelings long pent up. In that instant all his life passed before him--its hopes, its failures, its miseries, its madness. ""Yes!"" he thought, ""I am mad.""",sound violence action sight break watch gift cherish friend wake master sense whole school see sate pale breathless excitement awe poor man bear flung chair hide face hand burst hysterical tear outbreak feeling pend instant life pass hope failure misery madness think mad 
24,"Raising his head, he cried wildly, ""Boys, go, I am mad!"" and sank again into his former position, rocking himself to and fro. One by one the boys stole out, and he was left alone. The end is soon told. Forced to leave Ayrton, he had no means of earning his daily bread; and the weight of this new anxiety hastening the crisis, the handsome proud scholar became an inmate of the Brerely Lunatic Asylum. A few years afterwards, Eric heard that he was dead. Poor broken human heart! may he rest in peace.",raise head cry boy go mad sink former position rock for boy steal leave alone end tell forced leave have means earn daily bread weight new anxiety hasten crisis handsome proud scholar become inmate brerely lunatic few year hear dead poor break human heart rest peace 
25,"Such was Eric's first school and schoolmaster. But although he learnt little there, and gained no experience of the character of others or of his own, yet there was one point about Ayrton Latin School, which he never regretted. It was the mixture there of all classes. On those benches gentlemen's sons sat side by side with plebeians, and no harm, but only good, seemed to come from the intercourse. The neighboring gentry, most of whom had begun their education there, were drawn into closer and kindlier union with their neighbors and dependents, from the fact of having been their associates in the days of their boyhood. Many a time afterwards, when Eric, as he passed down the streets, interchanged friendly greetings with some young glazier or tradesman whom he remembered at school, he felt glad that thus early he had learnt practically to despise the accidental and nominal differences which separate man from man.",such first school schoolmaster learn little gain experience character other own be point latin regret mixture class bench gentleman son sit side side plebeian harm good seem come intercourse neighbor gentry most begin education draw close kindly union neighbor dependent fact associate day boyhood many time pass street interchang friendly greeting young glazier tradesman remember school feel glad learn despise accidental nominal difference separate man man
