1,CHAPTER XVIII. I TALK WITH ALAN IN THE WOOD OF LETTERMORE,talk wood 
2,"Alan was the first to come round. He rose, went to the border of the wood, peered out a little, and then returned and sat down.",first come rise go border wood peer little return sit 
3,"“Well,” said he, “yon was a hot burst, David.”",say hot burst 
4,"I said nothing, nor so much as lifted my face. I had seen murder done, and a great, ruddy, jovial gentleman struck out of life in a moment; the pity of that sight was still sore within me, and yet that was but a part of my concern. Here was murder done upon the man Alan hated; here was Alan skulking in the trees and running from the troops; and whether his was the hand that fired or only the head that ordered, signified but little. By my way of it, my only friend in that wild country was blood-guilty in the first degree; I held him in horror; I could not look upon his face; I would have rather lain alone in the rain on my cold isle, than in that warm wood beside a murderer.",say much lift face see murder do great ruddy jovial gentleman strike life moment pity sight sore part concern murder do man hate skulk tree run troops hand fire head order signify little way only friend wild country blood guilty first degree hold horror look face lain alone rain cold isle warm wood murderer 
5,“Are ye still wearied?” he asked again.,weary ask 
6,"“No,” said I, still with my face in the bracken; “no, I am not wearied now, and I can speak. You and me must twine,” * I said. “I liked you very well, Alan, but your ways are not mine, and they’re not God’s: and the short and the long of it is just that we must twine.”",say face bracken weary speak twine say like way short long twine 
7,     * Part.,part 
8,"“I will hardly twine from ye, David, without some kind of reason for the same,” said Alan, mighty gravely. “If ye ken anything against my reputation, it’s the least thing that ye should do, for old acquaintance’ sake, to let me hear the name of it; and if ye have only taken a distaste to my society, it will be proper for me to judge if I’m insulted.”",twine kind reason same say ke reputation least thing do old acquaintance sake let hear name take distaste society proper judge insult 
9,"“Alan,” said I, “what is the sense of this? Ye ken very well yon Campbell-man lies in his blood upon the road.”",say sense man lie blood road 
10,"He was silent for a little; then says he, “Did ever ye hear tell of the story of the Man and the Good People?”--by which he meant the fairies.",silent little say hear tell story good mean fairy 
11,"“No,” said I, “nor do I want to hear it.”",say want hear 
12,"“With your permission, Mr. Balfour, I will tell it you, whatever,” says Alan. “The man, ye should ken, was cast upon a rock in the sea, where it appears the Good People were in use to come and rest as they went through to Ireland. The name of this rock is called the Skerryvore, and it’s not far from where we suffered ship-wreck. Well, it seems the man cried so sore, if he could just see his little bairn before he died! that at last the king of the Good People took peety upon him, and sent one flying that brought back the bairn in a poke* and laid it down beside the man where he lay sleeping. So when the man woke, there was a poke beside him and something into the inside of it that moved. Well, it seems he was one of these gentry that think aye the worst of things; and for greater security, he stuck his dirk throughout that poke before he opened it, and there was his bairn dead. I am thinking to myself, Mr. Balfour, that you and the man are very much alike.”",permission tell say man cast rock sea appear good person use come rest go name rock call suffer ship wreck seem man cry sore see little bairn die last king good take peety send fly bring bairn poke lay man lay sleep man wake be poke inside move seem gentry think bad thing great security stick dirk poke open be bairn dead think man alike

14,"“Do you mean you had no hand in it?” cried I, sitting up.",mean have hand cry sit 
15,"“I will tell you first of all, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, as one friend to another,” said Alan, “that if I were going to kill a gentleman, it would not be in my own country, to bring trouble on my clan; and I would not go wanting sword and gun, and with a long fishing-rod upon my back.”",tell first friend say go kill gentleman own country bring trouble clan go want sword gun long fishing rod back 
16,"“Well,” said I, “that’s true!”",say true 
17,"“And now,” continued Alan, taking out his dirk and laying his hand upon it in a certain manner, “I swear upon the Holy Iron I had neither art nor part, act nor thought in it.”",continue take dirk lay hand certain manner swear holy have art part act think 
18,"“I thank God for that!” cried I, and offered him my hand.",thank cry offer hand 
19,He did not appear to see it.,appear see 
20,"“And here is a great deal of work about a Campbell!” said he. “They are not so scarce, that I ken!”",great deal work say scarce ke 
21,"“At least,” said I, “you cannot justly blame me, for you know very well what you told me in the brig. But the temptation and the act are different, I thank God again for that. We may all be tempted; but to take a life in cold blood, Alan!” And I could say no more for the moment. “And do you know who did it?” I added. “Do you know that man in the black coat?”",least say blame know tell brig temptation act different thank tempt take life cold blood say more moment know do add know man black coat 
22,"“I have nae clear mind about his coat,” said Alan cunningly, “but it sticks in my head that it was blue.”",have clear mind coat say stick head blue 
23,"“Blue or black, did ye know him?” said I.",blue black know say 
24,"“I couldnae just conscientiously swear to him,” says Alan. “He gaed very close by me, to be sure, but it’s a strange thing that I should just have been tying my brogues.”",swear say gake close sure strange thing tie brogue 
25,"“Can you swear that you don’t know him, Alan?” I cried, half angered, half in a mind to laugh at his evasions.",swear know cry half anger half mind laugh evasion 
26,"“Not yet,” says he; “but I’ve a grand memory for forgetting, David.”",say have grand memory forget 
27,"“And yet there was one thing I saw clearly,” said I; “and that was, that you exposed yourself and me to draw the soldiers.”",be thing see say expose draw soldier 
28,"“It’s very likely,” said Alan; “and so would any gentleman. You and me were innocent of that transaction.”",likely say gentleman innocent transaction 
29,"“The better reason, since we were falsely suspected, that we should get clear,” I cried. “The innocent should surely come before the guilty.”",good reason suspect get clear cry innocent come guilty 
30,"“Why, David,” said he, “the innocent have aye a chance to get assoiled in court; but for the lad that shot the bullet, I think the best place for him will be the heather. Them that havenae dipped their hands in any little difficulty, should be very mindful of the case of them that have. And that is the good Christianity. For if it was the other way round about, and the lad whom I couldnae just clearly see had been in our shoes, and we in his (as might very well have been), I think we would be a good deal obliged to him oursel’s if he would draw the soldiers.”",say innocent have chance assoil court lad shoot bullet think good place heather havenae dip hand little difficulty mindful case have good other way lad noe see shoe think good deal oblige oursel draw soldier 
31,"When it came to this, I gave Alan up. But he looked so innocent all the time, and was in such clear good faith in what he said, and so ready to sacrifice himself for what he deemed his duty, that my mouth was closed. Mr. Henderland’s words came back to me: that we ourselves might take a lesson by these wild Highlanders. Well, here I had taken mine. Alan’s morals were all tail-first; but he was ready to give his life for them, such as they were.",come give look innocent time such clear good faith say ready sacrifice deem duty mouth close word come take lesson wild take moral tail first ready give life such 
32,"“Alan,” said I, “I’ll not say it’s the good Christianity as I understand it, but it’s good enough. And here I offer ye my hand for the second time.”",say say good understand good offer hand second time 
33,"Whereupon he gave me both of his, saying surely I had cast a spell upon him, for he could forgive me anything. Then he grew very grave, and said we had not much time to throw away, but must both flee that country: he, because he was a deserter, and the whole of Appin would now be searched like a chamber, and every one obliged to give a good account of himself; and I, because I was certainly involved in the murder.",give say cast spell forgive grow grave say have much time throw flee country deserter whole search chamber one oblige give good account involved murder 
34,"“O!” says I, willing to give him a little lesson, “I have no fear of the justice of my country.”",say willing give little lesson have fear justice country 
35,"“As if this was your country!” said he. “Or as if ye would be tried here, in a country of Stewarts!”",country say try country 
36,"“It’s all Scotland,” said I.",say 
37,"“Man, I whiles wonder at ye,” said Alan. “This is a Campbell that’s been killed. Well, it’ll be tried in Inverara, the Campbells’ head place; with fifteen Campbells in the jury-box and the biggest Campbell of all (and that’s the Duke) sitting cocking on the bench. Justice, David? The same justice, by all the world, as Glenure found awhile ago at the roadside.”",man wonder say kill try head place jury box big sit cock bench same justice world find roadside 
38,"This frightened me a little, I confess, and would have frightened me more if I had known how nearly exact were Alan’s predictions; indeed it was but in one point that he exaggerated, there being but eleven Campbells on the jury; though as the other four were equally in the Duke’s dependence, it mattered less than might appear. Still, I cried out that he was unjust to the Duke of Argyle, who (for all he was a Whig) was yet a wise and honest nobleman.",frighten little confess frighten more know exact prediction point exaggerate be jury other dependence matter less appear cry unjust wise honest nobleman 
39,"“Hoot!” said Alan, “the man’s a Whig, nae doubt; but I would never deny he was a good chieftain to his clan. And what would the clan think if there was a Campbell shot, and naebody hanged, and their own chief the Justice General? But I have often observed,” says Alan, “that you Low-country bodies have no clear idea of what’s right and wrong.”",hoot say man doubt deny good chieftain clan clan think be shot naebody hang own chief observe say lo country body have clear idea right wrong 
40,"At this I did at last laugh out aloud, when to my surprise, Alan joined in, and laughed as merrily as myself.",last laugh surprise join laugh 
41,"“Na, na,” said he, “we’re in the Hielands, David; and when I tell ye to run, take my word and run. Nae doubt it’s a hard thing to skulk and starve in the Heather, but it’s harder yet to lie shackled in a red-coat prison.”",say tell run take word run doubt hard thing skulk starve hard lie shackle red coat prison 
42,"I asked him whither we should flee; and as he told me “to the Lowlands,”  I was a little better inclined to go with him; for, indeed, I was growing impatient to get back and have the upper-hand of my uncle. Besides, Alan made so sure there would be no question of justice in the matter, that I began to be afraid he might be right. Of all deaths, I would truly like least to die by the gallows; and the picture of that uncanny instrument came into my head with extraordinary clearness (as I had once seen it engraved at the top of a pedlar’s ballad) and took away my appetite for courts of justice.",ask flee tell little inclined go grow impatient get have upper hand uncle make sure be question justice matter begin afraid right death like least die gallow picture uncanny instrument come head extraordinary clearness see engrave top pedlar ballad take appetite court justice 
43,"“I’ll chance it, Alan,” said I. “I’ll go with you.”",chance say go 
44,"“But mind you,” said Alan, “it’s no small thing. Ye maun lie bare and hard, and brook many an empty belly. Your bed shall be the moorcock’s, and your life shall be like the hunted deer’s, and ye shall sleep with your hand upon your weapons. Ay, man, ye shall taigle many a weary foot, or we get clear! I tell ye this at the start, for it’s a life that I ken well. But if ye ask what other chance ye have, I answer: Nane. Either take to the heather with me, or else hang.”",mind say small thing lie bare hard briok many empty belly bed moorcock life hunt deer sleep hand weapon taigle many weary foot get clear tell start life ke ask other chance have answer take heather hang 
45,"“And that’s a choice very easily made,” said I; and we shook hands upon it.",choice make say shake hand 
46,"“And now let’s take another keek at the red-coats,” says Alan, and he led me to the north-eastern fringe of the wood.",let take keek red coat say lead north eastern fringe wood 
47,"Looking out between the trees, we could see a great side of mountain, running down exceeding steep into the waters of the loch. It was a rough part, all hanging stone, and heather, and big scrogs of birchwood; and away at the far end towards Balachulish, little wee red soldiers were dipping up and down over hill and howe, and growing smaller every minute. There was no cheering now, for I think they had other uses for what breath was left them; but they still stuck to the trail, and doubtless thought that we were close in front of them.",look tree see great side mountain run exceed steep water loch rough part hang stone heather big scrog birchwood far end little wee red soldier dip hill howe grow small minute be cheering think have other use breath leave stick trail think close front 
48,"Alan watched them, smiling to himself.",watch smile 
49,"“Ay,” said he, “they’ll be gey weary before they’ve got to the end of that employ! And so you and me, David, can sit down and eat a bite, and breathe a bit longer, and take a dram from my bottle. Then we’ll strike for Aucharn, the house of my kinsman, James of the Glens, where I must get my clothes, and my arms, and money to carry us along; and then, David, we’ll cry, ‘Forth, Fortune!’ and take a cast among the heather.”",say weary get end employ sit eat bite breathe bit take dram bottle strike house kinsman get clothes arm money carry cry take cast heather 
50,"So we sat again and ate and drank, in a place whence we could see the sun going down into a field of great, wild, and houseless mountains, such as I was now condemned to wander in with my companion. Partly as we so sat, and partly afterwards, on the way to Aucharn, each of us narrated his adventures; and I shall here set down so much of Alan’s as seems either curious or needful.",sit eat drink place see sun go field great wild houseless mountain such condemn wander companion sit way narrate adventure set much seem curious needful 
51,"It appears he ran to the bulwarks as soon as the wave was passed; saw me, and lost me, and saw me again, as I tumbled in the roost; and at last had one glimpse of me clinging on the yard. It was this that put him in some hope I would maybe get to land after all, and made him leave those clues and messages which had brought me (for my sins) to that unlucky country of Appin.",appear run bulwark wave pass see lose see tumble roost last have glimpse cling yard put hope get land make leave clue message bring sin unlucky country 
52,"In the meanwhile, those still on the brig had got the skiff launched, and one or two were on board of her already, when there came a second wave greater than the first, and heaved the brig out of her place, and would certainly have sent her to the bottom, had she not struck and caught on some projection of the reef. When she had struck first, it had been bows-on, so that the stern had hitherto been lowest. But now her stern was thrown in the air, and the bows plunged under the sea; and with that, the water began to pour into the fore-scuttle like the pouring of a mill-dam.",meanwhile brig get skiff launch board come second wave great first heave brig place send bottom strike catch projection reef strike bow stern low stern throw air bow plunge sea water begin pour fore scuttle pour mill dam 
53,"It took the colour out of Alan’s face, even to tell what followed. For there were still two men lying impotent in their bunks; and these, seeing the water pour in and thinking the ship had foundered, began to cry out aloud, and that with such harrowing cries that all who were on deck tumbled one after another into the skiff and fell to their oars. They were not two hundred yards away, when there came a third great sea; and at that the brig lifted clean over the reef; her canvas filled for a moment, and she seemed to sail in chase of them, but settling all the while; and presently she drew down and down, as if a hand was drawing her; and the sea closed over the Covenant of Dysart.",take colour face tell follow be man lie impotent bunk see water pour think ship founder begin cry such harrowing cry deck tumble skiff fall oar yard come third great sea brig lift clean reef canvas fill moment seem sail chase settle while draw hand draw sea close 
54,"Never a word they spoke as they pulled ashore, being stunned with the horror of that screaming; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason woke up, as if out of a muse, and bade them lay hands upon Alan. They hung back indeed, having little taste for the employment; but Hoseason was like a fiend, crying that Alan was alone, that he had a great sum about him, that he had been the means of losing the brig and drowning all their comrades, and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast. It was seven against one; in that part of the shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him.",word speak pull stunn horror scream have scarce set foot beach wake muse bid lay hand hang have little taste employment fiend cry alone have great sum means lose brig drown comrade revenge wealth single cast part shore be rock set back sailor begin spread come 
55,"“And then,” said Alan, “the little man with the red head--I havenae mind of the name that he is called.”",say little man red head havenae mind name call 
56,"“Riach,” said I.",say 
57,"“Ay” said Alan, “Riach! Well, it was him that took up the clubs for me, asked the men if they werenae feared of a judgment, and, says he ‘Dod, I’ll put my back to the Hielandman’s mysel’.’ That’s none such an entirely bad little man, yon little man with the red head,” said Alan. “He has some spunks of decency.”",say take club ask man fear judgment say put back mysel bad little man little man red head say have spunk decency 
58,"“Well,” said I, “he was kind to me in his way.”",say kind way 
59,"“And so he was to Alan,” said he; “and by my troth, I found his way a very good one! But ye see, David, the loss of the ship and the cries of these poor lads sat very ill upon the man; and I’m thinking that would be the cause of it.”",say troth find way good one see loss ship cry poor lad sit ill man think cause 
60,"“Well, I would think so,” says I; “for he was as keen as any of the rest at the beginning. But how did Hoseason take it?”",think say keen rest beginning take 
61,"“It sticks in my mind that he would take it very ill,” says Alan. “But the little man cried to me to run, and indeed I thought it was a good observe, and ran. The last that I saw they were all in a knot upon the beach, like folk that were not agreeing very well together.”",stick mind take ill say little man cry run think good observe run last see knot beach folk agree 
62,“What do you mean by that?” said I.,mean say 
63,"“Well, the fists were going,” said Alan; “and I saw one man go down like a pair of breeks. But I thought it would be better no to wait. Ye see there’s a strip of Campbells in that end of Mull, which is no good company for a gentleman like me. If it hadnae been for that I would have waited and looked for ye mysel’, let alone giving a hand to the little man.” (It was droll how Alan dwelt on Mr. Riach’s stature, for, to say the truth, the one was not much smaller than the other.) “So,” says he, continuing, “I set my best foot forward, and whenever I met in with any one I cried out there was a wreck ashore. Man, they didnae stop to fash with me! Ye should have seen them linking for the beach! And when they got there they found they had had the pleasure of a run, which is aye good for a Campbell. I’m thinking it was a judgment on the clan that the brig went down in the lump and didnae break. But it was a very unlucky thing for you, that same; for if any wreck had come ashore they would have hunted high and low, and would soon have found ye.”",fist go say see man go pair breek think good wait see be strip end good company gentleman wait look mysel let alone give hand little man droll dwele stature say truth one small other say continue set good foot meet one cry wreck man stop fash see link beach get find have pleasure run good think judgment clan brig go lump didnae break unlucky thing same wreck come hunt high low find
