2,"A great city swept away by the sea, a beautiful country devastated by an active volcano--these are not the sort of things you see every day of the week. And when you do see them, no matter how many other wonders you may have seen in your time, such sights are rather apt to take your breath away. Atlantis had certainly this effect on the breaths of Cyril, Robert, Anthea, and Jane.",great city sweep sea beautiful country devastate active volcano sort thing see day week see matter many other wonder see time such sight apt take breath have effect breath 
3,"They remained in a breathless state for some days. The learned gentleman seemed as breathless as anyone; he spent a good deal of what little breath he had in telling Anthea about a wonderful dream he had. ‘You would hardly believe,’ he said, ‘that anyone COULD have such a detailed vision.’",remain breathless state day learn gentleman seem breathless spend good deal little breath have tell wonderful dream have believe say have detailed vision

They undoubtedly were.,consequence breathless condition child suggest new excursion voice mood other say feed bit 
7,"As for the Psammead, it went to sand and stayed there, worn out by the terror of the flood and the violent exercise it had had to take in obedience to the inconsiderate wishes of the learned gentleman and the Babylonian queen.",go sand stay wear terror flood violent exercise have take obedience inconsiderate wish learn gentleman babylonian queen 
8,The children let it sleep. The danger of taking it about among strange people who might at any moment utter undesirable wishes was becoming more and more plain.,child let sleep danger take strange person moment utter undesirable wish become plain 
9,"And there are pleasant things to be done in London without any aid from Amulets or Psammeads. You can, for instance visit the Tower of London, the Houses of Parliament, the National Gallery, the Zoological Gardens, the various Parks, the Museums at South Kensington, Madame Tussaud’s Exhibition of Waxworks, or the Botanical Gardens at Kew. You can go to Kew by river steamer--and this is the way that the children would have gone if they had gone at all. Only they never did, because it was when they were discussing the arrangements for the journey, and what they should take with them to eat and how much of it, and what the whole thing would cost, that the adventure of the Little Black Girl began to happen.",be pleasant thing do aid instance visit national zoological various botanical go river steamer way child go go discuss arrangement journey take eat much whole thing cost adventure little black begin happen 
10,"The children were sitting on a seat in St James’s Park. They had been watching the pelican repulsing with careful dignity the advances of the seagulls who are always so anxious to play games with it. The pelican thinks, very properly, that it hasn’t the figure for games, so it spends most of its time pretending that that is not the reason why it won’t play.",child sit seat watch pelican repulse careful dignity advance seagull anxious play game pelican think figure game spend most time pretend reason play

26,"She was not really a little black girl. She was shabby and not very clean, and she had been crying so much that you could hardly see, through the narrow chink between her swollen lids, how very blue her eyes were. It was her dress that was black, and it was too big and too long for her, and she wore a speckled black-ribboned sailor hat that would have fitted a much bigger head than her little flaxen one.

And now her mother’s dead, and she’s to stay tonight with Mrs Shrobsall--that’s a landlady that’s been kind--and tomorrow the Relieving Officer is coming for her, and she’s going into the Union; that means the Workhouse.

45,The learned gentleman looked up from his writing with the smile that had grown much easier to him than it used to be. They were quite at home in his room now; it really seemed to welcome them.

Above them, instead of the dusky ceiling of the Fitzroy Street floor, was a pale blue sky. And where the walls had been and the painted mummy-case, were tall dark green trees, oaks and ashes, and in between the trees and under them tangled bushes and creeping ivy. There were beech-trees too, but there was nothing under them but their own dead red drifted leaves, and here and there a delicate green fern-frond.",mist clear upside out sensation subside stand ring foot stand carpet learn gentleman room stand green grass dusky ceiling floor pale blue sky wall paint mummy case tall dark green tree oak ash tree tangle bush creep ivy be beech tree be own dead red drift leave delicate green fern frond 
63,"And there they stood in a circle still holding hands, as though they were playing Ring-o’-Roses or the Mulberry Bush. Just six people hand in hand in a wood.

The Psammead must have taken advantage of the loose wording of the learned gentleman’s wish, for it was not the same time of day as that on which the wish had been uttered among the dried ferns. It was sunset, and the great man sat on a chair outside his tent gazing over the sea towards Britain--everyone knew without being told that it was towards Britain.
