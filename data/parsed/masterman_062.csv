2,"The loud yells of the savages struck terror into the heart of Mrs Seagrave; it was well that she had not seen their painted bodies and fierce appearance, or she would have been much more alarmed.  Little Albert and Caroline clung around her neck with terror in their faces; they did not cry, but looked round and round to see from whence the horrid noise proceeded, and then clung faster to their mother.  Tommy was very busy, finishing all the breakfast which had been left, for there was no one to check him as usual; Juno was busy outside, and was very active and courageous.  Mr Seagrave had been employed making the holes between the palisades large enough to admit the barrels of the muskets, so that they could fire at the savages without being exposed; while William and Ready, with their muskets loaded, were on the look-out for their approach.",loud yell savage strike terror heart see paint body fierce appearance alarm little cling neck terror face cry look see horrid noise proceed cling fast mother busy finish breakfast leave be check usual busy active courageous employ make hole palisadd large admit barrel musket fire savage expose musket load look approach 
3,"""They are busy with the old house just now, sir,"" observed Ready, ""but that won't detain them long.""",busy old house sir observe ready detain 
4,"""Here they come,"" replied William; ""and look, Ready, is not that one of the women who escaped from us in the canoe, who is walking along with the first two men?  Yes, it is, I am sure.""",come reply look ready woman escape canoe walk first man sure 
5,"""You are right, William, it is one of them.  Ah! they have stopped; they did not expect the stockade, that is clear, and it has puzzled them; see how they are all crowding together and talking; they are holding a council of war how to proceed; that tall man must be one of their chiefs.  Now, William, although I intend to fight as hard as I can, yet I always feel a dislike to begin first; I shall therefore show myself over the palisades, and if they attack me, I shall then fire with a quiet conscience.""",right stop expect stockade clear puzzle see crowd talk hold council war proceed tall man chief intend fight feel dislike begin show palisadd attack fire quiet conscience 
6,"""But take care they don't hit you, Ready.""",take care hit ready 
7,"""No great fear of that, William.  Here they come.""",great fear come 
8,"Ready now stood upon the plank within, so as to show himself to the savages, who gave a tremendous yell, and as they advanced a dozen spears were thrown at him with so true an aim that, had he not instantly dodged behind the stockade, he must have been killed.  Three or four spears remained quivering in the palisades, just below the top; the others went over it, and fell down inside of the stockade, at the further end.",ready stand plank show savage give tremendous yell advance spear throw true aim dodg stockade kill spear remain quiver palisadd top other go fall stockade further end 
9,"""Now, William, take good aim;"" but before William could fire, Mr Seagrave, who had agreed to be stationed at the corner so that he might see if the savages went round to the other side, fired his musket, and the tall chief fell to the ground.",take good aim fire agree station corner see savage go other side fire musket tall chief fall ground 
10,"Ready and William also fired, and two more of the savages were seen to drop amidst the yells of their companions.  Juno handed up the other muskets which were ready loaded, and took those discharged, and Mrs Seagrave, having desired Caroline to take care of her little brother, and Tommy to be very quiet and good, came out, turned the key of the door upon them, and hastened to assist Juno in reloading the muskets.",ready fire more savage see drop yell companion hand other musket ready load take discharge desire take care little brother quiet good come turn key door hasten assist reload musket 
11,"The spears now rushed through the air, and it was well that they could fire from the stockade without exposing their persons, or they would have had but little chance.  The yells increased, and the savages now began to attack on every quarter; the most active, who climbed like cats, actually succeeded in gaining the top of the palisades, but, as soon as their heads appeared above, they were fired at with so true an aim that they dropped down dead outside.  This combat lasted for more than an hour, when the savages, having lost a great many men, drew off from the assault, and the parties within the stockade had time to breathe.",spear rush air fire stockade expose person have little chance yell increase savage begin attack quarter active climb cat succeed gain top palisadd head appear fire true aim drop dead combat last more hour savage lose great many man draw assault party stockade have time breathe 
12,"""They have not gained much in this bout, at all events,"" said Ready; ""it was well fought on our side, and William, you certainly behaved as if you had been brought up to it.""",gain much bout event say ready fight side behave bring 
13,"""Do you think they will go away now?"" said Mrs Seagrave.",think go say 
14,"""Oh, no, madam, not yet; they will try us every way before they leave us.  You see these are very brave men, and it is clear that they know what gunpowder is, or they would have been more astonished.""",madam try way leave see brave man clear know gunpowder astonished 
15,"""I should think so too,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""the first time that savages hear the report of firearms, they are usually thrown into great consternation.""",think reply first time savage hear report firearm throw great consternation 
16,"""Yes, sir; but such has not been the case with these people, and therefore I reckon it is not the first time that they have fought with Europeans.""",sir such case person reckon first time fight 
17,"""Are they all gone, Ready?"" said William, who had come down from the plank to his mother.",gone ready say come plank mother 
18,"""No; I see them between the trees now; they are sitting round in a circle, and, I suppose, making speeches.""",see tree sit circle suppose make speech 
19,"""Well, I'm very thirsty, at all events,"" said William; ""Juno, bring me a little water.""",thirsty event say bring little water 
20,"Juno went to the water-tub to comply with William's request, and in a few moments afterwards came back in great consternation.",go water tub comply request few moment come great consternation 
21,"""Oh, Massa! oh, Missy! no water; water all gone!""",water water gone 
22,"""Water all gone!"" cried Ready and all of them in a breath.",water gone cry ready breath 
23,"""Yes; not one little drop in the cask.""",little drop cask 
24,"""I filled it up to the top!"" exclaimed Ready very gravely; ""the tub did not leak, that I am sure of; how can this have happened?""",fill top exclaim ready tub leak sure happen 
25,"""Missy, I tink I know now,"" said Juno; ""you remember you send Massa Tommy, the two or three days we wash, to fetch water from the well in little bucket.  You know how soon he come back, and how you say what good boy he was, and how you tell Massa Seagrave when he come to dinner. Now, Missy, I quite certain Massa Tommy no take trouble go to well, but fetch water from tub all the while, and so he empty it.""",tink know say remember send day wash fetch water little bucket know come say good boy tell come dinner certain take trouble go fetch water tub while empty 
26,"""I'm afraid you're right, Juno,"" replied Mrs Seagrave.  ""What shall we do?""",afraid right reply do 
27,"""I go speak Massa Tommy,"" said Juno, running to the house.",go speak say run house 
28,"""This is a very awkward thing, Mr Seagrave,"" observed Ready gravely.",awkward thing observe ready 
29,Mr Seagrave shook his head.,shake head 
30,"The fact was, that they all perceived the danger of their position: if the savages did not leave the island, they would perish of thirst or have to surrender; and in the latter case, all their lives would most certainly be sacrificed.",fact perceive danger position savage leave island perish thirst have surrender latter case life sacrifice 
31,"Juno now returned: her suspicions were but too true.  Tommy, pleased with the praise of being so quick in bringing the water, had taken out the spigot of the cask, and drawn it all off.",return suspicion true pleased praise quick bring water take spigot cask draw 
32,"""Well,"" observed Mr Seagrave, ""it is the will of Heaven that all our careful arrangements and preparations against this attack should be defeated by the idleness of a child, and we must submit.""",observe will careful arrangement preparation attack defeat idleness child submit 
33,"""Very true, sir,"" replied Ready; ""all our hopes now are that the savages may be tired out, and leave the island.""",true sir reply ready hope savage tired leave island 
34,"""If I had but a little for the children, I should not care,"" observed Mrs Seagrave; ""but to see those poor things suffer--is there not a drop left, Juno, anywhere?""",have little child care observe see poor thing suffer be drop leave 
35,Juno shook her head.,shake head 
36,"Mrs Seagrave said she would go and examine, and went away into the house accompanied by Juno.",say go examine go house accompany 
37,"""This is a very bad business, Ready,"" observed Mr Seagrave.  ""What would we give for a shower of rain now, that we might catch the falling drops!""",bad business ready observe give shower rain catch falling drop 
38,"""There are no signs of it, sir,"" replied Ready; ""we must, however, put our confidence in One who will not forsake us.""",be sign sir reply ready put confidence forsake 
39,"""I wish the savages would come on again,"" observed William; ""for the sooner they come, the sooner the affair will be decided.""",wish savage come observe come affair decide 
40,"""I doubt if they will to-day; at night-time I think it very probable. We must make preparations for it.""",doubt day night time think probable make preparation 
41,"""Why, what can we do, Ready?""",do ready 
42,"""In the first place, sir, by nailing planks from cocoa-nut tree to cocoa-nut tree above the present stockade, we may make a great portion of it much higher, and more difficult to climb over.  Some of them were nearly in, this time.  If we do that, we shall not have so large a space to watch over and defend; and then we must contrive to have a large fire ready for lighting, that we may not have to fight altogether in the dark.  It will give them some advantage in looking through the palisades, and seeing where we are, but they cannot well drive their spears through, so it is no great matter.  We must make the fire in the centre of the stockade, and have plenty of tar in it, to make it burn bright, and we must not, of course, light it until after we are attacked.  We shall then see where they are trying for an entrance, and where to aim with our muskets.""",first place sir nail plank cocoa nut tree cocoa nut tree present stockade make great portion high difficult climb time do have large space watch defend contrive have large fire ready lighting have fight dark give advantage look palisadd see drive spear great matter make fire centre stockade have plenty tar make burn bright course light attack see try entrance aim musket 
43,"""The idea is very good, Ready,"" said Mr Seagrave; ""if it had not been for this unfortunate want of water, I really should be sanguine of beating them off.""",idea good ready say unfortunate want water sanguine beat 
44,"""We may suffer very much, Mr Seagrave, I have no doubt; but who knows what the morrow may bring forth?""",suffer have doubt know morrow bring 
45,"""True, Ready.  Do you see the savages now?""",true ready see savage 
46,"""No, sir; they have left the spot where they were in consultation.  I suppose they are busy with their wounded and their dead.""",sir leave spot consultation suppose busy wound dead 
47,"As Ready had supposed, no further attack was made by the savages on that day, and he, William, and Mr Seagrave, were very busy making their arrangements; they nailed the planks on the trunks of the trees above the stockade, so as to make three sides of the stockade at least five feet higher, and almost impossible to climb up; and they prepared a large fire in a tar-barrel full of cocoa-nut leaves mixed with wood and tar, so as to burn fiercely.  Dinner or supper they had none, for there was nothing but salt pork and beef and live turtle, and, by Ready's advice, they did not eat, as it would only increase their desire to drink.",ready suppose further attack make savage day busy make arrangement nail plank trunk tree stockade make side stockade least foot high impossible climb prepare large fire tar barrel full cocoa nut leave mix wood tar burn dinner supper have be salt pork beef live turtle advice eat increase desire drink 
48,"The poor children suffered much; and little Albert wailed and cried for ""water, water.""  Ready remained on the look-out; indeed, everything was so miserable inside of the house, that they were all glad to go out of it; they could do no good, and poor Mrs Seagrave had a difficult and most painful task to keep the children quiet under such severe privation, for the weather was still very warm and sultry.",poor child suffer much little wail cry water water ready remain look out miserable house glad go do good poor have difficult painful task keep child quiet such severe privation weather warm sultry
