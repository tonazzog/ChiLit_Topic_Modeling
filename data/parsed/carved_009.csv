1,CHAPTER IX. OUT IN THE RAIN.,chapter ix. rain 
2," It would be an exaggeration to say that I did not sleep that night. Children often sleep very heavily when they are specially unhappy, and I was unhappy enough, even before Harriet's telling me what she had heard. But though I did sleep, I shall never forget that night. My dreams were so miserable, and when I awoke--very early in the morning--I could scarcely separate them from real things. It was actually not so bad when I was quite awake, for then I set myself thoroughly to think it all over.",exaggeration say sleep night child sleep unhappy unhappy tell hear sleep forget night dream miserable awoke morning separate real thing bad awake set think 
3,"I could not bear it--I could not go on without knowing if it was true about father and mamma. I could not bear my life at school, if the looking forward to being with them again, before _very_ long, was to be taken from me. I must write a letter to mamma that no one would see; but first--yes, first I must know how much was true. Whom could I ask? Haddie? Perhaps he knew no more than I did, and it was just as difficult to write to him as to mamma. Then suddenly another thought struck me--Mrs. Selwood, old Mrs. Selwood, if I could but see her. Perhaps if I wrote to her she would come to see me; mamma always said she was very kind, though I know she did not care much for children, especially little girls. Still I thought I would try, though it would be difficult, for I should not like Miss Ledbury to know I had written to Mrs. Selwood secretly. She would be so angry, and I did not want to make Miss Ledbury angry. She was much nicer than the others. Once or twice the idea came to me of going straight to her and telling her how miserable I was, but that would bring in Harriet, and oh, how furious the other governesses would be! No, I would try to write to Mrs. Selwood--only, I did not know her address. I only knew the name of her house--Fernley--that would not be enough, at least I feared not. I would try to find out; perhaps Harriet could ask some one when she went home.",bear go know true father mamma bear life school look long take write letter mamma see know much true ask know more difficult write mamma thought strike old see write come see mamma say kind know care much child little girl think try difficult like know write angry want make angry nice other idea come go tell miserable bring furious other governess try write know address know name house enough least fear try find ask one go 
4,"My spirits rose a little with all this planning. I am afraid that the life I led was beginning to make me unchildlike and concealed in my ways. I enjoyed the feeling of having a secret and, so to say, outwitting my teachers, particularly Miss Broom. So, though I was looking pale and my eyes were still very swollen, I think Harriet was surprised, and certainly very glad, to find that I was not very miserable or upset.",spirit rise little planning afraid life lead begin make unchildlike conceal way enjoy feeling have secret say outwitt teacher look pale eye swollen think surprise glad find miserable upset 
5,A message was sent up to say I was to go down to breakfast with the others. And after prayers and breakfast were over I went into the schoolroom as usual.,message send say go breakfast other prayer breakfast go schoolroom usual 
6,"That morning did not pass badly; it happened to be a day for lessons I got on well with--written ones principally, and reading aloud. So I got into no fresh disgrace. It was a very rainy day, there was no question of going out, and I was sent to practise at twelve o'clock till the dressing-bell rang for the early dinner. That was to keep me away from the other girls.",morning pass happen day lesson get write one read get fresh disgrace rainy day be question go send practise o'clock dress bell ring early dinner keep other girl 
7,As soon as dinner was over Miss Broom came to me with a French poetry book in her hand.,dinner come french poetry book hand

10,"They were going to let me off rather easily, I thought, and possibly, just _possibly_, if Miss Ledbury was in the drawing-room too and seemed kind, I might ask her to give me leave to write to Mrs. Selwood just to say how very much I would like to see her, and then if I _did_ see her I could tell her what Harriet had said, without risking getting Harriet into trouble.",go let think draw room seem kind ask give leave write say much like see see tell say risk get trouble 
11,"So I set to work at my French poetry with good will, and long before three o'clock I had learnt it perfectly. There was a clock on the landing half-way down the staircase which struck the quarters and half-hours. I heard the quarter to three strike and then I read the poem right through six times, and after that, closing the book, I said it aloud to myself without one mistake, and then just as the clock began ""_burr_-ing"" before striking the hour I made my way quietly down to the drawing-room.",set work french poetry good will o'clock learn be clock landing half way staircase strike quarter half hour hear quarter strike read poem time close book say mistake clock begin ing strike hour make way draw room

24,"""But more important than learning your lessons well,"" continued Miss Ledbury, ""is to be perfectly truthful and honest. What has distressed me, Geraldine, has been to hear that when--as may happen to any child--you have forgotten a lesson, or learnt it imperfectly, instead of at once owning your fault, you have tried to screen yourself behind insincere excuses.

27,"""I wish you to state exactly what you have had to complain of in Geraldine Le Marchant,"" she said. And Miss Broom, with a far from amiable expression, repeated the whole--my carelessness and ill-prepared lessons for some time past, the frequent excuses I made, saying that she had not told me what she certainly _had_ told me, my forgetting my French poetry altogether, and persisting in denying that it had been given out.",wish state have complain say amiable expression repeat whole carelessness ill prepare lesson time past frequent excuse make say tell tell forget french poetry persist deny give 
28,"I did not hear clearly all she said, but she raised her voice at the end, and I caught her last words.

34,"Then a strange thing happened. I really wanted to say the poetry well, partly out of pride, partly because again something in Miss Ledbury's manner made me feel gentler, but as I opened my mouth to begin, the words entirely left my memory. I looked up--possibly a little help, a syllable just to start me, would have set me right, but instead of that I saw Miss Broom's half-mocking, half-angry face, and Miss Aspinall's cold hard eyes. Miss Ledbury I did not look at. In reality I think both she and Miss Aspinall were afraid of Miss Broom. I do not think Miss Aspinall was as hard as she seemed.",strange thing happen want say poetry pride manner make feel gentler open mouth begin word leave memory look little help syllable start set see half mocking half angry face cold hard eye look reality think afraid think hard seem

I stood there, dull and stupid and obstinate, though a perfect fire was raging inside me.",grow stony care doubt word think verse come say stand dull stupid obstinate perfect fire rage 
41,"""Geraldine,"" said Miss Ledbury again, still more sadly and sternly.",say 
42,"I was only a child, and I was almost exhausted by all I had gone through. Even my pride gave way. I forgot all that Emma and Harriet had said about not crying, and, half turning away from the three before me, I burst into a loud fit of tears and sobbing.",child exhaust go pride give way forget say cry half turn burst loud fit tear sobb

48,"I did not care now. I suffered myself to be led back to my room, and I left off crying almost as suddenly as I had begun, and when Miss Aspinall shut the door, and left me there without speaking to me again, I sat down on the foot of my bed as if I did not care at all, for again there came over me that strange stolid feeling that nothing mattered, that nothing would ever make me cry again.",care suffer lead room leave cry begin shut door leave speak sit foot bed care come strange stolid feeling matter make cry 
49,"It did not last long, however. I got up in a few minutes and looked out of the window. It was the dullest afternoon I had ever seen, raining, raining steadily, the sky all gloomy no-colour, duller even than gray. It might have been any season, late autumn, mid-winter; there was not a leaf, or the tiniest beginning of one, on the black branches of the two or three trees in what was called ""the garden""--for my window looked to the back of the house--not the very least feeling of spring, even though we were some way on in April. I gave a little shiver, and then a sudden thought struck me. It would be a very good time for getting out without any one seeing me--no one would fancy it possible that I would venture out in the rain, and all my schoolfellows and the governesses were still at lessons. What was the use of waiting here? They might keep me shut up in my room for--for ever, perhaps--and I should never know about father and mamma, or get Mrs. Selwood's address or be allowed to write to her, or--or any one. I would go.",last get few minute look window dullest afternoon see rain rain sky gloomy colour duller gray season late autumn mid winter be leaf tiniest beginning black branch tree call garden window look back house least feeling spring way give little shiver sudden thought strike good time get one see fancy possible venture rain schoolfellow governess lesson use waiting keep shut room know father mamma get address allow write one go 
50,"It took but a few minutes to put on my things. As I have said, there was a queer mixture of childishness and ""old-fashionedness,"" as it is called, about me. I dressed myself as sensibly as if I had been a grown-up person, choosing my thickest boots and warm jacket, and arming myself with my waterproof cape and umbrella. I also put my purse in my pocket--it contained a few shillings.",take few minute put thing say be queer mixture childishness old fashionedness call dress grow person choose thickest boot warm jacket arme waterproof cape umbrella put purse pocket contain few shilling 
51,"Then I opened the door and listened, going out a little way into the passage to do so. All was quite quiet--not even a piano was to be heard, only the clock on the landing sounded to me much louder than usual. If I had waited long, it would have made me nervous. I should have begun to fancy it was talking to me like Dick Whittington's bells, though, I am sure, it would not have said anything half so cheering!",open door listen go little way passage do quiet piano hear clock landing sound louder usual wait make nervous begin fancy talk bell sure say half cheer 
52,"[I CREPT DOWNSTAIRS, PAST ONE SCHOOLROOM WITH ITS CLOSED DOOR.]",crept past schoolroom closed door 
53,"But I did not wait to hear. I crept downstairs, past one schoolroom with its closed door, and a muffled sound of voices as I drew quite close to it, then on again, past the downstairs class-room, and along the hall to the front door. For that was what I had made up my mind was the best, bold as it seemed. I would go right out by the front door. I knew it opened easily, for we went out that way on Sundays to church, and once or twice I had opened it. And nobody would ever dream of my passing out that way.",wait hear creep schoolroom close door muffled sound voice draw close downstairs class room hall front door make mind good bold seem go front door know open go way church open dream passing way 
54,"It was all managed quite easily, and almost before I had time to take in what I had done, I found myself out in the road some little distance from Green Bank, for as soon as the gate closed behind me I had set off running from a half-nervous fear that some one might be coming in pursuit of me. I ran on a little farther, in the same direction, that of the town, for Miss Ledbury's house was in the outskirts--then, out of breath, I stood still to think what I should do.",manage have time take do find road little distance green gate close set run half nervous fear one come pursuit run little far same direction town house outskirt breath stand think do 
55,"I had really not made any distinct plan. The only idea clearly in my mind was to get Mrs. Selwood's address, so that I could write to her. But as I stood there, another thought struck me. I would go home--to the house in the dull street which had never seemed dull to me! For there, I suddenly remembered, I might find one of our own servants. I recollected Lydia's telling me that cook was probably going to ""engage"" with the people who had taken the house. And cook would be sure to know Mrs. Selwood's address, and--_perhaps_--cook would be able to tell me something about father and mamma. She was a kind woman--I would not mind telling her how dreadfully frightened I was about them since Harriet Smith had repeated what she had heard.",make distinct plan only idea mind get address write stand thought strike go house dull street seem dull remember find own servant recollect tell cook go engage person take house cook sure know address cook able tell father mamma kind woman mind tell frighten repeat hear 
56,"I knew the way to our house, at least I thought I did, though afterwards I found I had taken two or three wrong turnings, which had made my journey longer. It was scarcely raining by this time, but the streets were dreadfully wet and muddy, and the sky still dark and gloomy.",know way house least think find take wrong turning make journey rain time street wet muddy sky dark gloomy 
57,"At last I found myself at the well-known corner of our street--how often I had run round it with Haddie, when we had been allowed to go on some little errand by ourselves! I had not passed this way since mamma went, and the feeling that came over me was very strange. I went along till I came to our house, number 39; then, in a sort of dream, I mounted the two or three steps to the door, and rang the bell. How well I knew its sound! It seemed impossible to believe that Lydia would not open to me, and that if I hurried upstairs I should not find mamma sitting in her usual place in the drawing-room!",last find know corner street run allow go little errand pass way mamma go feeling come strange go come house number sort dream mount step door ring bell know sound seem impossible believe open hurry find mamma sit usual place draw room

61,"""I'd rather see her, please. I want to ask her for Mrs. Selwood's address. Mrs. Selwood's a friend of mamma's, and I'm sure cook would know. We used to live here, and Lydia said cook was going to stay.""",see want ask address friend mamma sure cook know use live say cook go stay

66,"""Thank you,"" I said, and I turned away, my heart swelling with disappointment.",thank say turn heart swell disappointment 
67,"I walked on quickly for a little way, for I felt sure the servant was looking after me. Then I stopped short and asked myself again ""what should I do?"" The girl had advised me to go ""home""--""home"" to Green Bank, to be shut up in my room again, and be treated as a story-teller, and never have a chance of writing to Mrs. Selwood or any one! No, that I would not do. The very thought of it made me hasten my steps as if to put a greater distance between myself and Miss Ledbury's house. And I walked on some way without knowing where I was going except that it was in an opposite direction from school.",walk little way feel sure servant look stop short ask do girl advise go home home green shut room treat story teller have chance write one do very thought make hast step put great distance house walk way know go opposite direction school 
68,"It must have been nearly six o'clock by this time, and the gloomy day made it already dusk. The shops were lighting up, and the glare of the gas on the wet pavement made me look about me. I was in one of the larger streets now, a very long one, that led right out from the centre of the town to the outskirts. I was full of a strange kind of excitement; I did not mind the rain, and indeed it was not very heavy; I did not feel lonely or frightened, and my brain seemed unusually active and awake.",o'clock time gloomy day make dusk shop light glare gas wet pavement make look large street long one lead centre town outskirt full strange kind excitement mind rain heavy feel lonely frighten brain seem active awake 
69,"""I know what I'll do,"" I said to myself; ""I'll go to the big grocer's where they give Haddie and me those nice gingerbreads, and I'll ask _them_ for Mrs. Selwood's address. I remember mamma said Mrs. Selwood always bought things there. And--and--I won't write to her. I'll go to the railway and see if I've money enough to get a ticket, and I'll go to Mrs. Selwood and tell her how I can't bear it any longer. I've got four shillings, and if that isn't enough I daresay the railway people wouldn't mind if I promised I'd send it them.""",know do say go big grocer give nice gingerbread ask address remember mamma say buy thing write go railway see have money get ticket go tell bear get shilling enough daresay railway person mind promise send 
70,"I marched on, feeling once more very determined and valiant. I thought I knew the way to the big grocer's quite well, but when I turned down a street which looked like the one where it was, I began to feel a little confused. There were so many shops, and the lights in the windows dazzled me, and worst of all, I could not remember the name of the grocer's. It was something like Simpson, but not Simpson. I went on, turning again more than once, always in hopes of seeing it before me, but always disappointed. And I was beginning to feel very tired; I must, I suppose, have been really tired all the time, but my excitement had kept me up.",march feel determined valiant think know way big grocer turn street look one begin feel little confused be many shop light window dazzle bad remember name grocer go turn more hope see disappointed begin feel tired suppose tired time excitement keep 
71,"At last I found myself in a much darker street than the others. For there were few shops in it, and most of the houses were offices of some kind. It was a wide street and rather hilly. As I stood at the top I saw it sloping down before me; the light of the tall lamps glimmered brokenly in the puddles, for it was raining again more heavily now. Suddenly, as if in a dream, some words came back to me, so clearly that I could almost have believed some one was speaking. It was mamma's voice.",last find dark street other be few shop most house office kind wide street hilly stand top see slope light tall lamp glimmer puddle rain dream word come believe one speak mamma voice
