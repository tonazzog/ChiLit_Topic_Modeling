1,CHAPTER 49. My Last Home,last 
2," One day during this summer the groom cleaned and dressed me with such extraordinary care that I thought some new change must be at hand; he trimmed my fetlocks and legs, passed the tarbrush over my hoofs, and even parted my forelock. I think the harness had an extra polish. Willie seemed half-anxious, half-merry, as he got into the chaise with his grandfather.",day summer groom clean dress such extraordinary care think new change hand trim fetlock leg pass tarbrush hoof part forelock think harness have extra polish seem half anxious half merry get chaise grandfather

4,"At the distance of a mile or two from the village we came to a pretty, low house, with a lawn and shrubbery at the front and a drive up to the door. Willie rang the bell, and asked if Miss Blomefield or Miss Ellen was at home. Yes, they were. So, while Willie stayed with me, Mr. Thoroughgood went into the house. In about ten minutes he returned, followed by three ladies; one tall, pale lady, wrapped in a white shawl, leaned on a younger lady, with dark eyes and a merry face; the other, a very stately-looking person, was Miss Blomefield. They all came and looked at me and asked questions. The younger lady--that was Miss Ellen--took to me very much; she said she was sure she should like me, I had such a good face. The tall, pale lady said that she should always be nervous in riding behind a horse that had once been down, as I might come down again, and if I did she should never get over the fright.",distance mile village come pretty low house lawn shrubbery front drive door ring bell ask home stay go house minute return follow lady tall pale lady wrap white shawl learn young lady dark eye merry face other stately look person come look ask question young lady take say sure like have good face tall pale lady say nervous ride horse come do get fright 
5,"“You see, ladies,” said Mr. Thoroughgood, “many first-rate horses have had their knees broken through the carelessness of their drivers without any fault of their own, and from what I see of this horse I should say that is his case; but of course I do not wish to influence you. If you incline you can have him on trial, and then your coachman will see what he thinks of him.”",see lady say many first rate horse have knee break carelessness driver fault own see horse say case course wish influence incline have trial coachman see think

15,"I could not say that I remembered him, for now he was a fine grown young fellow, with black whiskers and a man’s voice, but I was sure he knew me, and that he was Joe Green, and I was very glad. I put my nose up to him, and tried to say that we were friends. I never saw a man so pleased.",say remember fine grow young fellow black whisker man voice sure know glad put nose try say friend see man pleased 
16,"“Give you a fair trial! I should think so indeed!

I wish John Manly was here to see you.”",give fair trial think wonder rascal break knee old beauty serve fault have good time wish see 
17,"In the afternoon I was put into a low park chair and brought to the door. Miss Ellen was going to try me, and Green went with her.

23,"Willie always speaks to me when he can, and treats me as his special friend. My ladies have promised that I shall never be sold, and so I have nothing to fear; and here my story ends.
