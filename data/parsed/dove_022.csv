1,CHAPTER XXI. RITTER THEURDANK,
2," THE snow fell all night without ceasing, and was still falling on the morrow, when the guest explained his desire of paying a short visit to the young Baron, and then taking his departure.  Christina would gladly have been quit of him, but she felt bound to remonstrate, for their mountain was absolutely impassable during a fall of snow, above all when accompanied by wind, since the drifts concealed fearful abysses, and the shifting masses insured destruction to the unwary wayfarer; nay, natives themselves had perished between the hamlet and the castle.",snow fall night cease fall guest explain desire pay short visit young take departure quit feel bind remonstrate mountain impassable fall snow accompany wind drift conceal fearful abysse shift mass insure destruction unwary wayfarer native perish hamlet castle

8,"“So!” he said, with a peculiar smile, “Theurdank—Dankwart—I see!  May I ask if your son likewise smelt out the Schlangenwald?”",say peculiar smile see ask son smell 
9,"“Verily, Sir Count, my Ebbo is not easily deceived.  He said our guest could be but one man in all the empire.”",deceive say guest man empire 
10,"Theurdank smiled again, saying, “Then, lady, you shudder not at a man whose kin and yours have shed so much of one another’s blood?”",smile say lady shudder man kin shed much blood 
11,"“Nay, ghostly knight, I regard you as no more stained therewith than are my sons by the deeds of their grandfather.”",ghostly knight regard stain son deed grandfather 
12,"“If there were more like you, lady,” returned Theurdank, “deadly feuds would soon be starved out.  May I to your son?  I have more to say to him, and I would fain hear his views of the storm.”",be more lady return deadly feud starve son have more say hear view storm 
13,"Christina could not be quite at ease with Theurdank in her son’s room, but she had no choice, and she knew that Heinz was watching on the turret stair, out of hearing indeed, but as ready to spring as a cat who sees her young ones in the hand of a child that she only half trusts.",ease son room have choice know watch turret stair hearing ready spring cat see young one hand child half trust 
14,"Ebbo lay eagerly watching for his visitor, who greeted him with the same almost paternal kindness he had evinced the night before, but consulted him upon the way from the castle.  Ebbo confirmed his mother’s opinion that the path was impracticable so long as the snow fell, and the wind tossed it in wild drifts.",lay watch visitor greet same paternal kindness evince night consult way castle confirm mother opinion path impracticable snow fall wind toss wild drift 
15,"“We have been caught in snow,” he said, “and hard work have we had to get home!  Once indeed, after a bear hunt, we fully thought the castle stood before us, and lo! it was all a cruel snow mist in that mocking shape.  I was even about to climb our last Eagle’s Step, as I thought, when behold, it proved to be the very brink of the abyss.”",catch snow say hard work have get bear hunt think castle stand cruel snow mist mocking shape about climb last think prove very brink abyss 
16,"“Ah! these ravines are well-nigh as bad as those of the Inn.  I’ve known what it was to be caught on the ledge of a precipice by a sharp wind, changing its course, mark’st thou, so swiftly that it verily tore my hold from the rock, and had well-nigh swept me into a chasm of mighty depth. There was nothing for it but to make the best spring I might towards the crag on the other side, and grip for my life at my alpenstock, which by Our Lady’s grace was firmly planted, and I held on till I got breath again, and felt for my footing on the ice-glazed rock.”",ravine nigh bad know catch ledge precipice sharp wind change course tore hold rock have nigh sweep chasm mighty depth be make good spring crag other side grip life alpenstock grace plant hold get breath feel footing ice glaze rock 
17,"“Ah!” said Eberhard with a long breath, after having listened with a hunter’s keen interest to this hair’s-breadth escape, “it sounds like a gust of my mountain air thus let in on me.”",say long breath listen hunter keen interest hair breadth escape sound gust mountain air let 
18,"“Truly it is dismal work for a lusty hunter to lie here,” said Theurdank, “but soon shalt thou take thy crags again in full vigour, I hope.  How call’st thou the deep gray lonely pool under a steep frowning crag sharpened well-nigh to a spear point, that I passed yester afternoon?”",dismal work lusty hunter lie say take crag full vigour hope call’st deep gray lonely pool steep frowning crag sharpen nigh spear point pass yest afternoon 
19,"“The Ptarmigan’s Mere, the Red Eyrie,” murmured Ebbo, scarcely able to utter the words as he thought of Friedel’s delight in the pool, his exploit at the eyrie, and the gay bargain made in the streets of Ulm, that he should show the scaler of the Dom steeple the way to the eagle’s nest.",mere red murmure able utter word think delight pool exploit eyrie gay bargain make street show scaler steeple way eagle nest 
20,"“I remember,” said his guest gravely, coming to his side.  “Ah, boy! thy brother’s flight has been higher yet.  Weep freely; fear me not.  Do I not know what it is, when those who were over-good for earth have found their eagle’s wings, and left us here?”",remember say guest come side brother flight high weep fear know good earth find eagle wing leave 
21,"Ebbo gazed up through his tears into the noble, mournful face that was bent kindly over him.  “I will not seek to comfort thee by counselling thee to forget,” said Theurdank.  “I was scarce thine elder when my life was thus rent asunder, and to hoar hairs, nay, to the grave itself, will she be my glory and my sorrow.  Never owned I brother, but I trow ye two were one in no common sort.”",gaze tear noble mournful face bend seek comfort counsell forget say scarce elder life rent hoar hair grave glory sorrow own brother trow common sort 
22,"“Such brothers as we saw at Ulm were little like us,” returned Ebbo, from the bottom of his heart.  “We were knit together so that all will begin with me as if it were the left hand remaining alone to do it!  I am glad that my old life may not even in shadow be renewed till after I have gone in quest of my father.”",such brother see little return bottom heart knit begin left hand remain alone do glad old life shadow renew go quest father 
23,"“Be not over hasty in that quest,” said the guest, “or the infidels may chance to gain two Freiherren instead of one.  Hast any designs?”",hasty quest say guest infidel chance gain hast design 
24,"Ebbo explained that he thought of making his way to Genoa to consult the merchant Gian Battista dei Battiste, whose description of the captive German noble had so strongly impressed Friedel.  Ebbo knew the difference between Turks and Moors, but Friedel’s impulse guided him, and he further thought that at Genoa he should learn the way to deal with either variety of infidel.  Theurdank thought this a prudent course, since the Genoese had dealings both at Tripoli and Constantinople; and, moreover, the transfer was not impossible, since the two different hordes of Moslems trafficked among themselves when either had made an unusually successful razzia.",explain think make way consult merchant description captive german noble impress know difference impulse guide think learn way deal variety infidel think prudent course have dealing transfer impossible different horde traffick make successful razzia 
25,"“Shame,” he broke out, “that these Eastern locusts, these ravening hounds, should prey unmolested on the fairest lands of the earth, and our German nobles lie here like swine, grunting and squealing over the plunder they grub up from one another, deaf to any summons from heaven or earth!  Did not Heaven’s own voice speak in thunder this last year, even in November, hurling the mighty thunderbolt of Alsace, an ell long, weighing two hundred and fifteen pounds?  Did I not cause it to be hung up in the church of Encisheim, as a witness and warning of the plagues that hang over us?  But no, nothing will quicken them from their sloth and drunkenness till the foe are at their doors; and, if a man arise of different mould, with some heart for the knightly, the good, and the true, then they kill him for me!  But thou, Adlerstein, this pious quest over, thou wilt return to me.  Thou hast head to think and heart to feel for the shame and woe of this misguided land.”",shame break eastern locust ravening hound prey unmolested fair land earth german noble lie swine grunt squeal plunder grub deaf summons heaven earth own voice speak thunder last year hurl mighty thunderbolt ell long weigh pound cause hang church witness warning plague hang quick sloth drunkenness foe door man arise different mould heart knightly good true kill pious quest return hast head think heart feel shame woe misguided land 
26,"“I trust so, my lord,” said Ebbo.  “Truly, I have suffered bitterly for pursuing my own quarrel rather than the crusade.”",trust lord say suffer pursue own quarrel crusade 
27,"“I meant not thee,” said Theurdank, kindly.  “Thy bridge is a benefit to me, as much as, or more than, ever it can be to thee.  Dost know Italian? There is something of Italy in thine eye.”",mean say bridge benefit much know italian be eye 
28,"“My mother’s mother was Italian, my lord; but she died so early that her language has not descended to my mother or myself.”",mother mother italian lord die language descend mother 
29,"“Thou shouldst learn it.  It will be pastime while thou art bed-fast, and serve thee well in dealing with the Moslem.  Moreover, I may have work for thee in Welschland.  Books?  I will send thee books.  There is the whole chronicle of Karl the Great, and all his Palsgrafen, by Pulci and Boiardo, a brave Count and gentleman himself, governor of Reggio, and worthy to sing of deeds of arms; so choice, too, as to the names of his heroes, that they say he caused his church bells to be rung when he had found one for Rodomonte, his infidel Hector.  He has shown up Roland as a love-sick knight, though, which is out of all accord with Archbishop Turpin.  Wilt have him?”",learn pastime art bed fast serve deal have work book send book be whole chronicle great brave count gentleman governor worthy sing deed arm choice name hero say cause church bell rung find infidel show love sick knight accord have 
30,"“When we were together, we used to love tales of chivalry.”",use love tale chivalry 
31,"“Ah!  Or wilt have the stern old Ghibelline Florentine, who explored the three realms of the departed?  Deep lore, and well-nigh unsearchable, is his; but I love him for the sake of his Beatrice, who guided him.  May we find such guides in our day!”",have stern old explore realm depart deep lore unsearchable love sake guide find such guide day

36,"“Ah!” he added aloud to himself, “it is ever to me as though the poet had watched in that chamber at Ghent.”",add poet watch chamber 
37,"Such were the discourses of that morning, now on poetry and book lore; now admiration of the carvings that decked the room; now talk on grand architectural designs, or improvements in fire-arms, or the discussion of hunting adventures.  There seemed nothing in art, life, or learning in which the versatile mind of Theurdank was not at home, or that did not end in some strange personal reminiscence of his own.  All was so kind, so gracious, and brilliant, that at first the interview was full of wondering delight to Ebbo, but latterly it became very fatiguing from the strain of attention, above all towards a guest who evidently knew that he was known, while not permitting such recognition to be avowed.  Ebbo began to long for an interruption, but, though he could see by the lightened sky that the weather had cleared up, it would have been impossible to have suggested to any guest that the way might now probably be open, and more especially to such a guest as this.  Considerate as his visitor had been the night before, the pleasure of talk seemed to have done away with the remembrance of his host’s weakness, till Ebbo so flagged that at last he was scarcely alive to more than the continued sound of the voice, and all the pain that for a while had been in abeyance seemed to have mastered him; but his guest, half reading his books, half discoursing, seemed too much immersed in his own plans, theories, and adventures, to mark the condition of his auditor.",such discourse morning poetry book lore admiration carving deck room talk grand architectural design improvement fire arm discussion hunting adventure seem art life learning versatile mind home end strange personal reminiscence own kind gracious brilliant first interview full wonder delight become fatiguing strain attention guest know know permitt such recognition avow begin interruption see lighten sky weather clear impossible suggest guest way open guest considerate visitor night pleasure talk seem do remembrance host weakness flagge last alive more continue sound voice pain while abeyance seem master guest half read book half discours seem immerse own plan theory adventure mark condition auditor 
38,"Interruption came at last, however.  There was a sudden knock at the door at noon, and with scant ceremony Heinz entered, followed by three other of the men-at-arms, fully equipped.",interruption come last be sudden knock door noon scant ceremony enter follow other man arm equip 
39,“Ha! what means this?” demanded Ebbo.,mean demand 
40,"“Peace, Sir Baron,” said Heinz, advancing so as to place his large person between Ebbo’s bed and the strange hunter.  “You know nothing of it.  We are not going to lose you as well as your brother, and we mean to see how this knight likes to serve as a hostage instead of opening the gates as a traitor spy.  On him, Koppel! it is thy right.”",peace say advance place large person bed strange hunter know go lose brother mean see knight like serve hostage open gate traitor spy right 
41,"“Hands off! at your peril, villains!” exclaimed Ebbo, sitting up, and speaking in the steady resolute voice that had so early rendered him thoroughly their master, but much perplexed and dismayed, and entirely unassisted by Theurdank, who stood looking on with almost a smile, as if diverted by his predicament.",hand peril villain exclaim sit speak steady resolute voice render master perplex dismay unassist stand look smile divert predicament 
42,"“By your leave, Herr Freiherr,” said Heinz, putting his hand on his shoulder, “this is no concern of yours.  While you cannot guard yourself or my lady, it is our part to do so.  I tell you his minions are on their way to surprise the castle.”",leave say put hand shoulder concern guard lady part do tell minion way surprise castle 
43,"Even as Heinz spoke, Christina came panting into the room, and, hurrying to her son’s side, said, “Sir Count, is this just, is this honourable, thus to return my son’s welcome, in his helpless condition?”",speak come pant room hurry son side say honourable return son welcome helpless condition 
44,"“Mother, are you likewise distracted?” exclaimed Ebbo.  “What is all this madness?”",mother distract exclaim madness 
45,"“Alas, my son, it is no frenzy!  There are armed men coming up the Eagle’s Stairs on the one hand and by the Gemsbock’s Pass on the other!”",son frenzy be armed man come hand pass other 
46,"“But not a hair of your head shall they hurt, lady,” said Heinz.  “This fellow’s limbs shall be thrown to them over the battlements.  On, Koppel!”",hair head hurt lady say fellow limb throw battlement 
47,"“Off, Koppel!” thundered Ebbo.  “Would you brand me with shame for ever? Were he all the Schlangenwalds in one, he should go as freely as he came; but he is no more Schlangenwald than I am.”",thunder brand shame go come more 
48,"“He has deceived you, my lord,” said Heinz.  “My lady’s own letter to Schlangenwald was in his chamber.  ’Tis a treacherous disguise.”",deceive lord say lady own letter chamber tis treacherous disguise 
49,"“Fool that thou art!” said Ebbo.  “I know this gentleman well.  I knew him at Ulm.  Those who meet him here mean me no ill.  Open the gates and receive them honourably!  Mother, mother, trust me, all is well.  I know what I am saying.”",fool art say know gentleman know meet mean ill open gate receive mother mother trust well know say 
50,"The men looked one upon another.  Christina wrung her hands, uncertain whether her son were not under some strange fatal deception.",man look wrung hand uncertain son strange fatal deception 
51,"“My lord has his fancies,” growled Koppel.  “I’ll not be balked of my right of vengeance for his scruples!  Will he swear that this fellow is what he calls himself?”",lord have fancy growl balk right vengeance scruple swear fellow call 
52,"“I swear,” said Ebbo, slowly, “that he is a true loyal knight, well known to me.”",swear say true loyal knight know 
53,"“Swear it distinctly, Sir Baron,” said Heinz.  “We have all too deep a debt of vengeance to let off any one who comes here lurking in the interest of our foe.  Swear that this is Theurdank, or we send his head to greet his friends.”",swear say have deep debt vengeance let one come lurk interest foe swear send head greet friend 
54,"Drops stood on Ebbo’s brow, and his breath laboured as he felt his senses reeling, and his powers of defence for his guest failing him.  Even should the stranger confess his name, the people of the castle might not believe him; and here he stood like one indifferent, evidently measuring how far his young host would go in his cause.",drop stand brow breath laboure feel sense reel power defence guest fail stranger confess name person castle believe stand indifferent measure young host go cause 
55,"“I cannot swear that his real name is Theurdank,” said Ebbo, rallying his forces, “but this I swear, that he is neither friend nor fosterer of Schlangenwald, that I know him, and I had rather die than that the slightest indignity were offered him.”  Here, and with a great effort that terribly wrenched his wounded leg, he reached past Heinz, and grasped his guest’s hand, pulling him as near as he could.",swear real name say rallying force swear friend fosterer know die slight indignity offer great effort wrench wound leg reach grasp guest hand pull 
56,"“Sir,” he said, “if they try to lay hands on you, strike my death-blow!”",say try lay hand strike death blow 
57,"A bugle-horn was wound outside.  The men stood daunted—Christina in extreme terror for her son, who lay gasping, breathless, but still clutching the stranger’s hand, and with eyes of fire glaring on the mutinous warriors.  Another bugle-blast!  Heinz was almost in the act of grappling with the silent foe, and Koppel cried as he raised his halbert, “Now or never!” but paused.",bugle horn wind man stand daunt extreme terror son lay gasp breathless clutch stranger hand eye fire glaring mutinous warrior bugle blast act grapple silent foe cry raise pause

59,"“No masking,” said Heinz, sternly.  “Tell your true name as an honest man, and we will judge whether you be friend or foe.”",masking say tell true name honest man judge friend foe 
60,"“My name is a mouthful, as your master knows,” said the guest, slowly, looking with strangely amused eyes on the confused lanzknechts, who were trying to devour their rage.  “I was baptized Maximilianus; Archduke of Austria, by birth; by choice of the Germans, King of the Romans.”",name mouthful master know say guest look amuse eye confuse lanzknecht try devour rage baptize birth choice 
61,“The Kaisar!”,
62,"Christina dropped on her knee; the men-at-arms tumbled backwards; Ebbo pressed the hand he held to his lips, and fainted away.  The bugle sounded for the third time.",drop knee man arm tumble press hand hold lip faint bugle sound third time
