4," Etheldred’s dream was over. She had wakened to the inside of a Great Western carriage, her father beside her, and opposite a thin, foreign-looking gentleman. Her father, to whom her life was to be devoted! She looked at his profile, defined against the window, and did not repent. In a sort of impulse to do something for him, she took his hat from his hand, and was going to dispose of it in the roof, when he turned, smiling his thanks, but saying, “it was not worth while--this carriage was a very transitory resting-place.”",dream waken inside great western carriage father thin foreign look gentleman father life devote look profile define window repent sort impulse do take hat hand go dispose roof turn smile thanks say worth while carriage transitory resting place

29,"They had been together at Stoneborough, at Cambridge, at Paris, at Edinburgh, always linked in the closest friendship; but, by Dr. May’s own account, his friend had been the diligent one of the pair, a bright compound of principle and spirit, and highly distinguished in all his studies, and Dr. May’s model of perfection. Their paths had since lain far apart, and they had not seen each other since, twenty-six years ago, they had parted in London--the one to settle at his native town, while the other accepted a situation as travelling physician. On his return, he had almost sacrificed his life, by self-devoted attendance on a fever-stricken emigrant-ship. He had afterwards received an appointment in India, and there the correspondence had died away, and Dr. May had lost traces of him, only knowing that, in a visitation of cholera, he had again acted with the same carelessness of his own life, and a severe illness, which had broken up his health, had occasioned him to relinquish his post.",link close friendship own account friend diligent one pair bright compound principle spirit distinguished study model perfection path lain see other year part one settle native town other accept situation travelling physician return sacrifice life self devote attendance fever stricken emigrant ship receive appointment correspondence die lose trace know visitation cholera act same carelessness own life severe illness break health occasion relinquish post

He had gone to recruit in the Himalayas, and had become engrossed in scientific observations on their altitudes, as well as investigations in natural history. Going to Calcutta, he had fallen in with a party about to explore the Asiatic islands and he had accompanied them, as well as going on an expedition into the interior of Australia. He had been employed in various sanitary arrangements there and in India, and had finally worked his way slowly home, overland, visiting Egypt and Palestine, and refreshing his memory with every Italian, German, or French Cathedral, or work of art, that had delighted him in early days.",appear think come go recruit become engross scientific observation altitude investigation natural history go fall party explore asiatic island accompany go expedition interior employ various sanitary arrangement work way overland visit refresh memory italian german french work art delight early day 
31,"He was a slight small man, much sunburned, nearly bald, and his hair snowy, but his eyes were beautiful, very dark, soft, and smiling, and yet their gaze peculiarly keen and steady, as if ready for any emergency, and his whole frame was full of alertness and vigour. His voice was clear and sweet, and his manner most refined and polished, indeed, his courtesy to Ethel, whenever there was a change of carriage, was so exemplary, that she understood it as the effect on a chivalrous mind, of living where a lady was a rare and precious article. It frightened Ethel a little at first, but, before the end of the journey, she had already begun to feel towards him like an old friend--one of those inheritances who are so much valued and loved, like a sort of uncles-in-friendship. She had an especial grateful honour for the delicate tact which asked no questions, as she saw his eye often falling anxiously on her father’s left hand, where the wedding ring shone upon the little finger.",slight small man sunburned bald hair snowy eye beautiful dark soft smile gaze keen steady ready emergency whole frame full alertness vigour voice clear sweet manner refine polished courtesy be change carriage exemplary understand effect chivalrous mind live lady rare precious article frighten little end journey begin feel old friend inheritance value love sort uncle friendship have especial grateful honour delicate tact ask question see eye fall father left hand wedding ring shine little finger

85,"Margaret seemed to guess nothing, that was one comfort; she evidently thought that her return was fully accounted for by the fascination of her papa’s presence in a strange place. She gave Ethel no credit for the sacrifice, naturally supposing that she could not enjoy herself away from home. Ethel did not know whether to be glad or not; she was relieved, but it was flat. As to Norman Ogilvie, one or two inquiries whether she liked him, and if Norman were going to Scotland with him, were all that passed, and it was very provoking to be made so hot and conscious by them.",seem guess comfort think return account fascination papa presence strange place give credit sacrifice suppose enjoy home know glad relieve flat inquiry like go pass provoking make hot conscious

Ah, Ethel, Sir Matthew Fleet never came near him in ability.

Dr. May looked convicted, but said it was all Norman’s fault; and Dr. Spencer, shaking his head at Blanche, opined that the young gentleman was a great innovater, and that he was sure he was at the bottom of the pulling down the Market Cross, and the stopping up Randall’s Alley--iniquities of the “nasty people,” of which she already had made him aware.",recover observe bad overhear repeat lead information pupil begin inquire school exclaim friend desert person look convict say fault shake head opine young gentleman great innovater sure bottom pull stop iniquity nasty person make aware

134,"There was something curious and affecting in their manner to each other. Often it was the easy bantering familiarity of the two youths they had once been together, with somewhat of elder brotherhood on Dr. Spencer’s side--and of looking up on Dr. May’s--and just as they had recurred to these terms, some allusion would bring back to Dr. Spencer, that the heedless, high-spirited “Dick,” whom he had always had much ado to keep out of scrapes, was a householder, a man of weight and influence; a light which would at first strike him as most ludicrous, and then mirth would end in a sigh, for there was yet another aspect! After having thought of him so long as the happy husband of Margaret Mackenzie, he found her place vacant, and the trace of deep grief apparent on the countenance, once so gay--the oppression of anxiety marked on the brow, formerly so joyous, the merriment almost more touching than gravity would have been, for the former nature seemed rather shattered than altered. In merging towards this side, there was a tender respect in Dr. Spencer’s manner that was most beautiful, though this evening such subjects were scrupulously kept at the utmost distance, by the constant interchange of new and old jokes and stories.",be curious affect manner other easy banter familiarity youth elder brotherhood side look recurr term allusion bring heedless high spirit have much ado keep scrape householder man weight influence light strike ludicrous mirth end sigh be aspect think happy husband find place vacant trace deep grief apparent countenance gay oppression anxiety mark brow joyous merriment touch gravity former nature seem shattered alter merge side be tender respect manner beautiful evening such subject keep utmost distance constant interchange new old joke story

139,"“Sorrow spared her,” was Dr. May’s first answer. “And hers are very good children!”",spare first answer good child 
140,"There was a silence again, ending in Dr. May’s saying, “What do you think of my poor girl?”",be silence end say think poor girl 
141,"They discussed the nature of the injury: Dr. Spencer could not feel otherwise than that it was a very hopeless matter. Her father owned that he had thought so from the first, and had wondered at Sir Matthew Fleet’s opinion. His subdued tone of patience and resignation, struck his guest above all, as changed from what he had once been.",discuss nature injury feel hopeless matter father own think first wonder opinion subdued tone patience resignation strike guest change 
142,"“You have been sorely tried,” he said, when they parted at his room door.",try say part room door 
143,“I have received much good!” simply answered Dr. May. “Goodnight! I am glad to have you here--if you can bear it.”,receive much good answer glad have bear 
144,“Bear it? Dick! how like that girl is to you! She is yourself!”,bear girl 
145,“Such a self as I never was! Good-night.”,self good night 
146,"Ethel overcame the difficulty of giving the account of the newspaper alarm with tolerable success, by putting the story of Meta’s conversation foremost. Margaret did not take it to heart as much as she had feared, nor did she appear to dwell on it afterwards. The truth was perhaps that Dr. Spencer’s visit was to every one more of an excitement and amusement than it was to Ethel. Not that she did not like him extremely, but after such a week as she had been spending, the home-world seemed rather stale and unprofitable.",overcame difficulty give account newspaper alarm tolerable success put story conversation foremost take heart much fear appear dwell truth visit one more excitement amusement like week spend home world seem stale unprofitable 
147,"Miss Bracy relapsed into a state of “feelings,” imagining that Ethel had distrusted her capabilities, and therefore returned; or as Ethel herself sometimes feared, there might be irritability in her own manner that gave cause of annoyance. The children were inclined to be riotous with their new friend, who made much of them continually, and especially patronised Aubrey; Mary was proud of showing how much she had learned to do for Margaret in her sister’s absence; Dr. May was so much taken up with his friend, that Ethel saw less of him than usual, and she began to believe that it had been all a mistake that every one was so dependent on her, for, in fact, they did much better without her.",relaps state feeling imagin distrust capability return fear be irritability own manner give cause annoyance child inclined riotous new friend make much patronise proud show much learn do sister absence take friend see less usual begin believe mistake one dependent fact do good 
148,"Meantime, she heard of the gaieties which the others were enjoying, and she could not feel heroic when they regretted her. At the end of a week, Meta Rivers was escorted home from Warwick by two servants, and came to Stoneborough, giving a lively description of all the concluding pleasures, but declaring that Ethel’s departure had taken away the zest of the whole, and Mr. Ogilvie had been very disconsolate. Margaret had not been prepared to hear that Mr. Ogilvie had been so constant a companion, and was struck by finding that Ethel had passed over one who had evidently been so great an ingredient in the delights of the expedition. Meta had, however observed nothing--she was a great deal too simple and too much engrossed for such notions to have crossed her mind; but Margaret inferred something, and hoped to learn more when she should see Flora. This would not be immediately. George and his wife were gone to London, and thence intended to pay a round of visits; and Norman had accompanied his namesake to Glenbracken.",hear gaiety other enjoy feel heroic regret end week escort servant come give lively description conclude pleasure declare departure take zest whole disconsolate prepare hear constant companion strike find pass great ingredient delight expedition observe great deal simple engross such notion cross mind infer hope learn more see wife go thence intend pay round visit accompany namesake 
149,"Ethel fought hard with her own petulance and sense of tedium at home, which was, as she felt, particularly uncalled for at present; when Dr. Spencer was enlivening them so much. He was never in the way, he was always either busy in the dining-room in the morning with books and papers, or wandering about his old school-boy haunts in the town, or taking Adam’s place, and driving out Dr. May, or sometimes joining the children in a walk, to their supreme delight. His sketches, for he drew most beautifully, were an endless pleasure to Margaret, with his explanations of them--she even tried to sit up to copy them, and he began to teach Blanche to draw. The evenings, when there was certain to be some entertaining talk going on between the two doctors, were very charming, and Margaret seemed quite revived by seeing her father so happy with his friend. Ethel knew she ought to be happy also, and if attention could make her so, she had it, for kind and courteous as Dr. Spencer was to all, she seemed to have a double charm for him. It was as if he found united in her the quaint brusquerie, that he had loved in her father, with somewhat of her mother; for though Ethel had less personal resemblance to Mrs. May than any other of the family, Dr. Spencer transferred to her much of the chivalrous distant devotion, with which he had regarded her mother. Ethel was very little conscious of it, but he was certainly her sworn knight, and there was an eagerness in his manner of performing every little service for her, a deference in his way of listening to her, over and above his ordinary polish of manner.",fight own petulance sense tedium home feel uncalled present enliven way busy dining room morning book paper wonder old school boy haunt town take place drive join child walk supreme delight sketche draw most endless pleasure explanation try sit copy begin teach draw evening be certain entertaining talk go doctor charming seem revive see father happy friend know happy attention make have kind courteous seem have double charm find unite quaint brusquerie love father mother have less personal resemblance other family transfer much chivalrous distant devotion regard mother little conscious swear knight be eagerness manner perform little service deference way listen ordinary polish manner 
150,"Ethel lighted up, and enjoyed herself when talking was going on--her periods of ennui were when she had to set about any home employment--when Aubrey’s lessons did not go well--when she wanted to speak to her father, and could not catch him; and even when she had to go to Cocksmoor.",light enjoy talk go period ennui have set home employment lesson go want speak father catch have go 
151,"She did not seem to make any progress there--the room was very full, and very close, the children were dull, and she began to believe she was doing no good--it was all a weariness. But she was so heartily ashamed of her feelings, that she worked the more vehemently for them, and the utmost show that they outwardly made was, that Margaret thought her less vivacious than her wont, and she was a little too peremptory at times with Mary and Blanche. She had so much disliked the display that Flora had made about Cocksmoor, that she had imposed total silence on it upon her younger sisters, and Dr. Spencer had spent a fortnight at Stoneborough without being aware of their occupation; when there occurred such an extremely sultry day, that Margaret remonstrated with Ethel on her intention of broiling herself and Mary by walking to Cocksmoor, when the quicksilver stood at 80° in the shade.",seem make progress room full close child dull begin believe do good weariness ashamed feeling work utmost show make think vivacious wont little peremptory time dislike display make impose total silence young sister spend fortnight aware occupation occur sultry day remonstrate intention broil walk quicksilver stand ° shade 
152,"Ethel was much inclined to stay at home, but she did not know whether this was from heat or from idleness, and her fretted spirits took the turn of determination--so she posted off at a galloping pace, that her brothers called her “Cocksmoor speed,” and Mary panted by her side, humbly petitioning for the plantation path, when she answered “that it was as well to be hot in the sun as in the shade.”",inclined stay home know heat idleness fret spirit take turn determination post gallop pace brother call speed pant side petition plantation path answer hot sun shade 
153,"The school-room was unusually full, all the haymaking mothers made it serve as an infant school, and though as much window was opened as there could be, the effect was not coolness. Nevertheless, Ethel sat down and gathered her class round her, and she had just heard the chapter once read, when there was a little confusion, a frightened cry of “Ethel!”  and before she could rise to her feet--a flump upon the floor--poor Mary had absolutely fainted dead away.",school room full haymaking mother make serve infant school much window open be effect coolness sit gather class hear chapter read be little confusion frighten cry rise foot flump floor poor faint dead 
154,"Ethel was much terrified, and very angry with herself; Mary was no light weight, but Mrs. Elwood coming at their cry, helped Ethel to drag her into the outer room, where she soon began to recover, and to be excessively puzzled as to what had happened to her. She said the sea was roaring, and where was Harry? and then she looked much surprised to find herself lying on Mrs. Elwood’s damp flags--a circumstance extremely distressing to Mrs. Elwood, who wanted to carry her upstairs into Cherry’s room, very clean and very white, but with such a sun shining full into it!",terrified angry light weight come cry help drag outer room begin recover puzzled happen say sea roar look surprised find lie damp flag circumstance distressing want carry room clean white sun shine full 
155,"Ethel lavished all care, and reproached herself greatly, though to be sure nothing had ever been supposed capable of hurting Mary, and Mary herself protested that nothing at all had ailed her till the children’s voices began to sound funny, and turned into the waves of the sea, and therewith poor Mary burst into a great flood of tears, and asked whether Harry would ever come back. The tears did her a great deal of good, though not so much as the being petted by Ethel, and she soon declared herself perfectly well; but Ethel could not think of letting her walk home, and sent off a boy--who she trusted would not faint--with a note to Margaret, desiring her to send the gig, which fortunately was at home to-day.",lavish care reproach sure suppose capable hurt protest ail child voice begin sound funny turn wave sea poor burst great flood tear ask come tear do great deal good much pett declare think let walk send boy trust faint note desire send gig home day 
156,"Mary had partaken of some of Mrs. Elwood’s tea, which, though extremely bitter, seemed a great cordial, and was sitting, quite revived, in the arbour at the door, when the gig stopped, and Dr. Spencer walked in.",partake tea bitter seem great cordial sit revive arbour door gig stop walk 
157,"“Well, and how are you?”",
158,"“Quite well now, thank you. Was Margaret frightened? Why did you come?”",thank frighten come

160,"“In the school,” and Mary opened the door. Dr. Spencer looked in, as Ethel came out, and his face put her in mind of Norman’s look.",school open door look come face put mind look 
161,“No wonder!” was all he said.,wonder say 
162,"Ethel was soon satisfied that he did not think Mary ill. In fact, he said fainting was the most natural and justifiable measure, under the circumstances. “How many human creatures do you keep there?” he asked.",satisfy think ill fact say fainting natural justifiable measure circumstance many human creature keep ask

168,"“We cannot help it,” said Mary. “We cannot get the ground.”",help say get ground 
169,"And Mary, having been voted into the seat of honour and comfort by his side in the carriage, told her version of Cocksmoor and the Committee; while Ethel sat up in the little narrow seat behind, severely reproaching herself for her want of consideration towards one so good and patient as Mary, who proved to have been suffering far more on Harry’s account than they had guessed, and who was so simple and thorough-going in doing her duty. This was not being a good elder sister, and, when they came home, she confessed it, and showed so much remorse that poor Mary was quite shocked, and cried so bitterly that it was necessary to quit the subject.",vote seat honour comfort side carriage tell version sit little narrow seat reproach want consideration good patient prove suffer more account guess simple thorough go do duty good elder sister come confess show much remorse poor shocked cry necessary quit subject

172,"“It will be better by-and-by,” said Margaret, “if only you are sure you have nothing to make you unhappy.”",good say sure have make unhappy 
173,"“Nothing,” said Ethel. She was becoming too much ashamed of her fancy to breathe one word about it, and she had spoken the truth. Pleasure had spoiled her.",say become ashamed fancy breathe word speak truth pleasure spoiled 
174,"“If only we could do something for Cocksmoor!” she sighed, presently, “with that one hundred and fifty pounds lying idle.”",do sigh pound lie idle 
175,"Margaret was very glad that her thoughts were taking this channel, but it was not a promising one, for there seemed to be nothing practicable, present or future. The ground could not be had--the pig would not get over the stile--the old woman could not get home to-night. Cocksmoor must put up with its present school, and Mary must not be walked to death.",glad thought take channel promising one seem be practicable present future ground have pig get stile old woman get night put present school walk death 
176,"Or, as Ethel drew her own moral, sacrifice must not be selfish. One great resolution that has been costly, must not blunt us in the daily details of life.",draw own moral sacrifice selfish great resolution costly blunt daily detail life
