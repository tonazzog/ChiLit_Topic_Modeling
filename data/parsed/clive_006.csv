2," After the young writers had seen the native town, they returned to the beach, and spent the afternoon watching the progress of landing the cargo of the Lizzie Anderson. They were pleased to see their own luggage safely ashore; as it would have been greatly damaged, had the boat containing it been swamped; a misfortune which happened to several of the boats laden with cargo. It was very amusing, each time that one of these boats arrived, to see a crowd of natives rush down into the water, waist deep, seize it, and drag it up beyond the next wave. Many of them would be knocked down, and some swept out by the retreating wave, only to return on the next roller. All could swim like fish, and any of these events were greeted with shouts of laughter by the rest.",young writer see native town return beach spend afternoon watch progress land cargo pleased see own luggage damage have boat contain swamp misfortune happen several boat laden cargo amusing time boat arrive see crowd native rush water waist deep seize drag next wave many knock sweep retreat wave return next roller swim fish event greet shout laughter rest 
3,"When the packages were landed a rope was put round them, and through this a long bamboo pole was inserted, which would be lifted on to the shoulders of two, four, or six porters, according to its weight; and these would go off, at a hobbling sort of trot, with their burden to the factory.",package land rope put long bamboo pole insert lift shoulder porter accord weight go hobble sort trot burden factory 
4,"Their own baggage was taken up to the quarters allotted to them, and at the hour named for dinner the newcomers met, for the first time, those with whom they were to be associated. All were dressed in white suits, and Charlie was struck with the pallor of their faces, and the listless air of most of them. The gentleman to whom they had first been introduced made them acquainted with the others.",own baggage take quarter allot hour name dinner newcomer meet first time associate dress white suit strike pallor face listless air most gentleman introduce make acquainted other 
5,"""How refreshingly healthy and well you look!"" a young man of some six and twenty years old, named Johnson, said. ""I was something like that, when I first came out here, though you'd hardly think it now. Eight years of stewing, in this horrible hole, takes the life and spirits out of anyone.",healthy look young man year old name say come think year stewing horrible hole take life spirit 
6,"""However, there's one consolation. After eight or ten years of quill driving in a stuffy room, one becomes a little more one's own master, and one's duties begin to be a little more varied and pleasant. One gets a chance of being sent up, occasionally, with goods; or on some message or other to one of the native princes, and then one gets treated like a prince, and sees that India is not necessarily so detestable as we have contrived to make it here. The only bearable time of one's life is the few hours after dinner, when one can sit in a chair in the veranda, and smoke and look at the sea. Some of the fellows play billiards and cards; but if you will take my advice, you won't go in for that sort of thing. It takes a lot out of one, and fellows that do it are, between you and me, in the bad books of the bigwigs. Besides, they lose money, get into debt, and all sorts of mischief comes of it.""",be consolation year quill driving stuffy room become little more own master duty begin little varied pleasant get chance send goods message other native prince treat prince see detestable contrive make only bearable time life few hour dinner sit chair veranda smoke look sea fellow play billiards card take advice go sort thing take lot fellow do bad book bigwig lose money get debt sort mischief come

11,"""I have not the least idea what we are eating,"" Charlie said, laughing; ""but it's really very nice, whatever it is. But there seems an immense quantity of pepper, or hot stuff of some kind or other; which one would have thought, in this tremendous heat, would have made one hotter instead of cooler.""",have least idea eat say laugh nice seem immense quantity pepper hot stuff kind other think tremendous heat make hot cool 
12,"""Yes,"" their new friend answered. ""No doubt all this pepper and curry do heat the blood; but you see, it is done to tempt the appetite. Meat here is fearfully coarse and tasteless.

Its sharpness would be delicious here.",most fruit tasteless say mango mangostine equal english fruit flavour give good english apple sharpness delicious 
16,"""And now, as you have done, if you will come and sit in the veranda of my room, we will smoke a cigar and have something cool to drink; and I will answer, as well as I can, the questions you've asked me about the state of things here.""",do come sit veranda room smoke cigar have cool drink answer question ask state thing

18,"""Madras isn't much of a place, now; but you should have seen it before the French had it. Our chiefs think of nothing but trade, and care nothing how squalid and miserable is the place in which they make money. The French have larger ideas. They transformed this place; cleared away that portion of the native town which surrounded the factory and fort, made wide roads, formed an esplanade, improved and strengthened the fortifications, forbade the natives to throw all their rubbish and offal on the beach; and made, in fact, a decent place of it. We hardly knew it when we came back, and whatever the Company may have thought, we were thoroughly grateful for the French occupation.",much place see have chief think trade care squalid miserable place make money have large idea transform place clear portion native town surround factory fort make wide road form esplanade improve strengthen fortification forbid native throw rubbish offal beach make fact decent place know come company think grateful french occupation 
19,"""One good result, too, is that our quarters have been greatly improved; for not only did the French build several new houses, but at present all the big men, the council and so on, are still living at Fort Saint David, which is still the seat of administration. So you see, we have got better quarters; we are rid of the stenches and nuisances of the native town; the plague of flies which made our life a burden is abated; and we can sit here and enjoy the cool sea breeze, without its being poisoned before it reaches us by the heaped up filth on the beach.",good result quarter improve build several new house present big man council live seat administration see get good quarter rid stenche nuisance native town plague fly make life burden abate sit enjoy cool sea breeze poison reach heap filth beach 
20,"""It must have wrung Dupleix's heart to give up the place over which they expended so much pains, and after all it didn't do away with the fighting. In April we sent a force from Fort Saint David--before we came back here--four hundred and thirty white soldiers and a thousand Sepoys, under the command of Captain Cope, to aid a fellow who had been turned out of the Rajahship of Tanjore. I believe he was a great blackguard, and the man who had taken his place was an able ruler liked by the people.""",wrung heart give place expend much pain do fighting send force come white soldier sepoy command aid fellow turn believe great blackguard man take place able ruler like person 
21,"""Then why should we interfere on behalf of the other?"" Charlie asked.",interfere behalf other ask 
22,"""My dear Marryat,"" their host said compassionately, ""you are very young yet, and quite new to India. You will see, after a time, that right has nothing at all to do with the dealings of the Company, in their relations to the native princes. We are, at present, little people living here on sufferance, among a lot of princes and powers who are enemies and rivals of each other. We have, moreover, as neighbours, another European colony considerably stronger than we are. The consequence is, the question of right cannot enter into the considerations of the Company. It may be said that, for every petty kingdom in Southern India, there are at least two pretenders, very often half a dozen. So far we have not meddled much in their quarrels, but the French have been much more active that way. They always side with one or other of these pretenders, and when they get the man they support into power, of course he repays them for their assistance. In this manner, as I shall explain to you presently, they have virtually made themselves masters of the Carnatic, outside the walls of Fort Saint David and this place.",dear host say young new see time right have do dealing company relation native prince present little person live sufferance lot prince power enemy rival other neighbour european colony strong consequence question right enter consideration company say petty kingdom southern be least pretender meddle much quarrel active way side other pretender get man support power course repay assistance manner explain make master wall place 
23,"""Well, our people thought to take a leaf out of the French book, and as the ex-rajah offered us, in payment for our aid, the possession of Devikota, a town at the mouth of the river Kolrun, a place likely to be of great use to us, we agreed to assist him. Cope, with the land forces, had marched to the border of the Tanjore territory, and the guns and heavy baggage were to go by sea.",person think take leaf french book ex-rajah offer payment aid possession town mouth river place likely great use agree assist cope land force march border territory gun heavy baggage go sea 
24,"""But, unfortunately, we had a tremendous gale just after they sailed. The admiral's flagship, the Namur, of seventy-four guns; the Pembroke, of sixty; and the hospital ship, Apollo, were totally lost; and the rest of the fleet scattered in all directions. Cope entered the Tanjore territory, but found the whole population attached to the new rajah. It was useless for him, therefore, to march upon Tanjore, which is a really strong town, so he marched down to Devikota, where he hoped to find some of the fleet. Not a ship, however, was to be seen, and as without guns Cope could do nothing, he returned here, as we had just taken possession again.",have tremendous gale sail admiral flagship gun hospital ship lose rest fleet scatter direction cope enter territory find whole population attach new rajah useless march strong town march hope find fleet ship see gun cope do return take possession 
25,"""Then he went to Fort Saint David, and there was a great discussion among the bigwigs. It was clear, from what Cope said, that our man had not a friend in his own country. Still, as he pointed out, Devikota was a most important place for us. Neither Madras nor Fort Saint David has a harbour; and Devikota, therefore, where the largest ships could run up the river and anchor, would be of immense utility to us.",go be great discussion bigwig clear say man have friend own country point important place have harbour large ship run river anchor immense utility 
26,"""As this was really the reason for which we had gone into the affair, it was decided to repeat the attempt. By this time Major Lawrence, who commands the whole of the Company's forces in India, and who had been taken a prisoner in one of the French sorties at the siege of Pondicherry, had been released. So he was put at the head of the expedition; and the whole of the Company's English troops, eight hundred in all, including the artillery; and fifteen hundred Sepoys, started on board ship for Devikota. I must tell you that Lawrence is a first-rate fellow, the only really good officer we have out here, and the affair couldn't have been in the hands of a better man.",reason go affair decide repeat attempt time command whole force take prisoner french sorty siege release put head expedition whole company english troops include artillery start board ship tell first rate fellow only good officer have affair hand good man 
27,"""The ships arrived safely at the mouth of the Kolrun, and the troops were landed on the bank of the river opposite the town, where Lawrence intended to erect his batteries; as, in the first place, the shore behind the town was swampy, and in the second the Rajah of Tanjore, who had got news of our coming, had his army encamped there to support the place. Lawrence got his guns in position and fired away, across the river, at the earthen wall of the town. In three days he had a breach. The enemy didn't return our fire, but occupied themselves in throwing up an entrenchment across the side of the fort.",ship arrive mouth troops land bank river town intend erect battery first place shore town swampy second get news come have army encamp support place get gun position fire river earthen wall town day have breach enemy return fire occupy throw entrenchment side fort 
28,"""We made a raft and crossed the river, but the enemy's matchlock men peppered us so severely that we lost thirty English and fifty Sepoys in getting over. The enemy's entrenchment was not finished, but in front of it was a deep rivulet, which had to be crossed.",make raft cross river enemy matchlock man pepper lose english get enemy entrenchment finish front deep rivulet have cross 
29,"""Lawrence gave the command of the storming party to Clive. He is one of our fellows; a queer, restless sort of chap, who was really no good here, for he hated his work and always seemed to think himself a martyr. He was not a favourite among us, for he was often gloomy and discontented, though he had his good points. He was straightforward and manly, and he put down two or three fellows here, who had been given to bully the young ones, in a way that astonished them.",give command storming party fellow queer restless sort chap good hate work seem think martyr favourite gloomy discontented have good point straightforward manly put fellow give bully young one way astonished 
30,"""He would never have made a good servant of the Company, for he so hated his work that, when he had been out here about a year, he tried to blow out his brains. He snapped the pistol twice at his head, but it didn't go off, though it was loaded all right. Strange, wasn't it? So he came to the conclusion that he wasn't meant to kill himself, and went on living till something should turn up.""",make good servant company hate work year try blow brain snap pistol head go load strange come conclusion mean kill go live turn 
31,"""Yes,"" Charlie said; ""Doctor Rae spoke to us about him during the voyage. He knew him at the siege of Fort Saint David, and Pondicherry.""",say speak voyage know siege 
32,"""Yes,"" Johnson said. ""He came out there quite in a new light. He got transferred into the military service, and was always in the middle of the fighting. Major Lawrence had a very high opinion of him, and so selected him to lead the storming party. It really seems almost as if he had a charmed life. Lawrence gave him thirty-three English soldiers, and seven hundred Sepoys. The rest of the force were to follow as soon as Clive's party gained the entrenchments. Clive led the way with his Europeans, with the Sepoys supporting behind, and got across the rivulet with a loss of only four men. He waited on the other bank till he saw the Sepoys climbing up, and then again led the English on in advance towards the unfinished part of the entrenchment.",say come new light transfer military service middle fighting have high opinion select lead storm party seem have charm life give english soldier sepoy rest force follow party gain entrenchment lead way support get rivulet loss man wait other bank see climb lead advance unfinished part entrenchment 
33,"""The Sepoys, however, did not move, but remained waiting for the main body to come up. The enemy let Clive and his twenty-nine men get on some distance in advance, and then their cavalry, who had been hidden by a projection of the fort, charged suddenly down on him. They were upon our men before they had time to form, and in a minute twenty-six of them were cut to pieces. Clive and the other three managed to get through the Tanjore horsemen and rejoin the Sepoys. That was almost as narrow a shave for his life as with the pistol.",move remain wait main body come enemy let man get distance advance cavalry hide projection fort charge man have time form minute cut piece other manage get horsemen rejoin narrow shave life pistol 
34,"""Lawrence now crossed with his main body and advanced. Again the Tanjore horsemen charged; but this time we were prepared, and Lawrence let them come on till within a few yards, and then gave them a volley which killed fourteen and sent the rest scampering away. Lawrence pushed forward. The garrison, panic stricken at the defeat of their cavalry, abandoned the breach and escaped to the opposite side of the town, and Devikota was ours.",cross main body advance horsemen charge time prepare let come few yard give volley kill send rest scamper push garrison panic stricken defeat cavalry abandon breach escape opposite side town 
35,"""A few days later we captured the fortified temple of Uchipuran. A hundred men were left there, and these were afterwards attacked by the Rajah of Tanjore, with five thousand men; but they held their own, and beat them off. A very gallant business, that!",few day capture fortify temple man leave attack man hold own beat gallant business 
36,"""These affairs showed the rajah that the English could fight; a point which, hitherto, the natives had been somewhat sceptical about. They were afraid of the French, but they looked upon us as mere traders. He had, too, other things to trouble him as to the state of the Carnatic, and so hastened to make peace. He agreed to pay the expenses of the war, and to cede us Devikota and some territory round it; and to allow the wretched ex-rajah, in whose cause we had pretended to fight, a pension of four hundred a year, on condition that we kept him shut up in one of our forts.",affair show rajah fight point native sceptical afraid look mere trader other thing trouble state hasten make peace agree pay expense war cede territory allow wretch ex-rajah cause pretend fight pension year condition keep shut fort

38,"""When the peace was signed, our force returned to Fort Saint David. While they had been away, there had been a revolution in the Carnatic. Now this was rather a complicated business; but as the whole situation at present turns upon it; and it will, not improbably, cause our expulsion from Southern India; I will explain it to you as well as I can.",peace sign force return be revolution complicated business whole situation present turn cause expulsion southern explain 
39,"""Now you must know that all Southern India, with the exception of a strip along the west coast, is governed by a viceroy, appointed by the emperor at Delhi. He was called the Subadar of the Deccan. Up till the end of 'forty-eight, Nizam Ul-Mulk was viceroy. About that time he died, and the emperor appointed his grandson, Muzaffar Jung, who was the son of a daughter of his, to succeed him. But the subadar had left five sons. Four of these lived at Delhi, and were content to enjoy their life there. The second son, however, Nazir Jung, was an ambitious man, who had rebelled even against his father. Naturally, he rebelled against his nephew.",know southern exception strip west coast govern viceroy appoint emperor call end viceroy time die emperor appoint grandson son daughter succeed subadar leave son live content enjoy life second son ambitious man rebell father rebell nephew 
40,"""He was on the spot when his father died, while the new subadar was absent. Nazir, therefore, seized the reins of government, and all the resources of the state. The emperor has troubles enough of his own at Delhi, and Muzaffar had no hope of aid from him. He therefore went to Satarah, the court of the Mahrattas, to ask for their assistance.",spot father die new subadar absent seize rein government resource state emperor have trouble enough own have hope aid go court ask assistance 
41,"""There he met Chunda Sahib. This man was the nephew of the last nawab of the Carnatic, Dost Ali. Dost Ali had been killed in a battle with them, in 1739; and they afterwards captured Trichinopoli, and took Chunda Sahib, who commanded there, prisoner; and had since kept him at Satarah. Had he been at liberty he would, no doubt, have succeeded his uncle, whose only son had been murdered; but as he was at Satarah, the Subadar of the Deccan bestowed the government of the Carnatic upon Anwarud-din.",meet man nephew last nawab kill battle capture take command prisoner keep liberty succeed uncle only son murder bestow government din 
42,"""Chunda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung put their heads together, and agreed to act in concert. Muzaffar, of course, desired the subadarship of the Deccan, to which he had been appointed by the court of Delhi. Chunda Sahib wanted the nawabship of the Carnatic, and advised his ally to abandon his intention of asking for Mahratta aid, and to ally himself with the French. A correspondence ensued with Dupleix, who, seeing the immense advantage it would be to him to gain what would virtually be the position of patron and protector of the Subadar of the Deccan, and the Nawab of the Carnatic, at once agreed to join them.",put head agree act concert course desire subadarship appoint court want nawabship advise ally abandon intention ask aid ally correspondence ensue see immense advantage gain position patron protector agree join 
43,"""Muzaffar raised thirty thousand men, and Chunda Sahib six thousand--it is always easy, in India, to raise an army; with a certain amount of money, and lavish promises--marched down and joined a French force of four hundred strong, commanded by D'Auteuil.",raise man easy raise army certain amount money lavish promise march join french force strong command 
44,"""The nawab advanced against them, but was utterly defeated at Ambur, the French doing pretty well the whole of the work. The nawab was killed, and one of his sons, Maphuz Khan, taken prisoner. The other, Muhammud Ali, bolted at the beginning of the fight. Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic, surrendered next day.",nawab advance defeat do whole work nawab kill son take prisoner other bolt beginning fight capital surrender next day 
45,"""Muzaffar Jung proclaimed himself Subadar of the Deccan, and appointed Chunda Sahib Nawab of the Carnatic. Muzaffar Jung conferred upon Dupleix the sovereignty of eighty-one villages adjoining the French territory. Muzaffar, after paying a visit to Pondicherry, remained in the camp with his army, twenty miles distant from that place. Chunda Sahib remained, as the guest of Dupleix, at Pondicherry.",proclaim appoint confer sovereignty village adjoin french territory pay visit remain camp army mile distant place remain guest 
46,"""On the receipt of the news of the battle of Ambur, Mr. Floyer, who is governor at Fort Saint David, sent at once to Chunda Sahib to acknowledge him as nawab; which, in the opinion of everyone here, was a very foolish step. Muhammud Ali had fled to Trichinopoli, and sent word to Mr. Floyer that he could hold the place, and even reconquer the Carnatic, if the English would assist him. I know that Admiral Boscawen, who was with the fleet at Fort Saint David, urged Mr. Floyer to do so, as it was clear that Chunda Sahib would be a mere tool in the hands of the French.",receipt news battle governor send acknowledge nawab opinion foolish step flead send word hold place reconquer assist know fleet urge do clear mere tool hand 
47,"""When Chunda Sahib delayed week after week at Pondicherry, Mr. Floyer began to hesitate, but he could not make up his mind, and Admiral Boscawen, who had received orders to return home, could no longer act in contravention to them, and was obliged to sail.",delay week week begin hesitate make mind receive order return act contravention oblige sail 
48,"""The instant the fleet had left, and we remained virtually defenceless, Chunda Sahib, supplied with troops and money by Dupleix, marched out from Pondicherry and joined Muzaffar Jung, with the avowed intention of marching upon Trichinopoli. Had he done this at once, he must have taken the place, and it was a question of weeks and days only of our being turned altogether out of Southern India. Nothing, indeed, could have saved us.",instant fleet leave remain defenceless supply troops money march join avowed intention march do take place question week day turn southern save 
49,"""Muzaffar Jung and Chunda Sahib, however, disregarding the plan which Dupleix had marked out for them, resolved, before marching on Trichinopoli, to conquer Tanjore, which is the richest city in Southern India. The rajah had, only a few weeks before, made peace with us; and he now sent messengers to Nazir Jung, Muzaffar's rival in the Deccan, and to the English, imploring their assistance. Both parties resolved at once to grant it, for alone both must have been overwhelmed by the alliance between the two Indian princes and the French; and their only hope of a successful resistance to this combination was in saving Trichinopoli.",disregard plan mark resolve march conquer rich city southern few week make peace send messenger rival implor assistance party resolve grant alone overwhelm alliance indian prince only hope successful resistance combination save 
50,"""The march of these allies upon Tanjore opened the road to Trichinopoli; and Captain Cope, with a hundred and twenty men, were at once despatched to reinforce Muhammud Ali's garrison. Of this little force, he sent off twenty men to the aid of the Rajah of Tanjore, and these, under cover of the night, passed through the lines of the besiegers and into the city, which was strongly fortified and able to stand a long siege.",march ally open road man despatch reinforce garrison little force send man aid cover night pass line besieger city fortify able stand long siege

52,"""Tanjore held out bravely. For some weeks the rajah had thrown dust in the eyes of Chunda Sahib, by pretending to negotiate. Then, when the allies attacked, he defended the city for fifty-two days, at the end of which one of the gates of the town had been captured, and the city was virtually at the mercy of the besiegers. He again delayed them by entering into negotiations for surrender. In vain Dupleix continued to urge Chunda Sahib to act energetically, and to enter Tanjore.",hold week rajah throw dust eye pretend negotiate ally attack defend city day end gate town capture city mercy besieger delay enter negotiation surrender vain continue urge act enter 
53,"""Chunda Sahib, however, although he has a good head for planning, is irresolute in action. His troops were discontented at the want of pay. The French contingent also was demoralized, from the same cause. The troops feared to engage in a desperate struggle, in the streets of a town abounding with palaces, each of which was virtually a fortress; especially as it was known that Nazir Jung was marching, with all speed, to fall upon their rear. So at last the siege was broken up, and the army fell back upon Pondicherry.",have good head planning irresolute action troops discontent want pay french contingent demoralize same cause troops fear engage desperate struggle street town abound palace fortress know march speed fall rear last siege break army fall 
54,"""Meanwhile Cope's detachment of a hundred men, with six thousand native horsemen, escorted Muhammud Ali to join Nazir Jung at Valdaur, fifteen miles from Pondicherry. Lawrence was busy at work at Fort Saint David, organizing a force to go to his aid. Dupleix saw that it was necessary to aid his allies energetically. The army, on its return from the siege of Tanjore, was reorganized; the French contingent increased to two thousand men; and a supply of money furnished, from his private means.",detachment man native horsemen escort join mile busy work organize force go aid see necessary aid ally army return siege reorganize french contingent increase man supply money furnish private means 
55,"""The army set out to attack Nazir Jung and his ally at Valdaur.

Chunda Sahib accompanied his men. Muzaffar Jung surrendered to his uncle, the usurper.",army set attack ally battle begin french contingent mutiny refuse fight native panic stricken desertion ally fall accompany man surrender uncle usurper

These, however, he defeated easily. While the battle was going on, the conspirators murdered Nazir Jung, released Muzaffar Jung, and saluted him as subadar. His escape was a fortunate one, for his uncle had ordered him to be executed that very day.",15th french commander gun march army man oppose defeat battle go conspirator murder release salute subadar escape fortunate one uncle order execute very day 
60,"""Muzaffar Jung proceeded to Pondicherry, where he was received with great honors. He nominated Dupleix Nawab of the Carnatic and neighbouring countries, with Chunda Sahib as his deputy, conferred the highest dignities upon him, and granted the French possession of all the lands and forts they had conquered. He arranged with Dupleix a plan for common action, and agreed that a body of French troops should remain permanently at his capital.""",proceed receive great honor nominate carnatic neighbour country deputy confer high dignity grant french possession land fort conquer arrange plan common action agree body french troops remain capital
