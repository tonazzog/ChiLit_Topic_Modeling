2,"“Let’s pretend,” suggested Harold, “that we’re Cavaliers and Roundheads; and YOU be a Roundhead!”",let pretend suggest 
3,"“O bother,” I replied drowsily, “we pretended that yesterday; and it’s not my turn to be a Roundhead, anyhow.” The fact is, I was lazy, and the call to arms fell on indifferent ears. We three younger ones were stretched at length in the orchard. The sun was hot, the season merry June, and never (I thought) had there been such wealth and riot of buttercups throughout the lush grass. Green-and-gold was the dominant key that day. Instead of active “pretence” with its shouts and perspiration, how much better--I held--to lie at ease and pretend to one’s self, in green and golden fancies, slipping the husk and passing, a careless lounger, through a sleepy imaginary world all gold and green! But the persistent Harold was not to be fobbed of.",bother reply pretend yesterday turn fact lazy call arm fall indifferent ear young one stretch length orchard sun hot season merry think be such wealth riot buttercup lush grass green gold dominant key day active pretence shout perspiration good hold lie ease pretend self green golden fancy slip husk passing careless lounger sleepy imaginary world gold green persistent fobb 
4,"“Well, then,” he began afresh, “let’s pretend we’re Knights of the Round Table; and (with a rush) _I’ll_ be Lancelot!”",begin let pretend round rush 
5,"“I won’t play unless I’m Lancelot,” I said. I didn’t mean it really, but the game of Knights always began with this particular contest.",play say mean game begin particular contest 
6,"“O PLEASE,” implored Harold. “You know when Edward’s here I never get a chance of being Lancelot. I haven’t been Lancelot for weeks!”",implore know get chance week 
7,"Then I yielded gracefully. “All right,” I said. “I’ll be Tristram.”",yield right say 
8,"“O, but you can’t,” cried Harold again.",cry 
9,“Charlotte has always been Tristram. She won’t play unless she’s allowed to be Tristram! Be somebody else this time.”,play allow else time 
10,"Charlotte said nothing, but breathed hard, looking straight before her. The peerless hunter and harper was her special hero of romance, and rather than see the part in less appreciative hands, she would even have returned sadly to the stuffy schoolroom.",say breathe look peerless hunter harper special hero romance see part appreciative hand return stuffy schoolroom 
11,"“I don’t care,” I said: “I’ll be anything. I’ll be Sir Kay. Come on!”",care say come 
12,"Then once more in this country’s story the mail-clad knights paced through the greenwood shaw, questing adventure, redressing wrong; and bandits, five to one, broke and fled discomfited to their caves. Once again were damsels rescued, dragons disembowelled, and giants, in every corner of the orchard, deprived of their already superfluous number of heads; while Palamides the Saracen waited for us by the well, and Sir Breuse Saunce Pite vanished in craven flight before the skilled spear that was his terror and his bane. Once more the lists were dight in Camelot, and all was gay with shimmer of silk and gold; the earth shook with thunder of horses, ash-staves flew in splinters; and the firmament rang to the clash of sword on helm. The varying fortune of the day swung doubtful--now on this side, now on that; till at last Lancelot, grim and great, thrusting through the press, unhorsed Sir Tristram (an easy task), and bestrode her, threatening doom; while the Cornish knight, forgetting hard-won fame of old, cried piteously, “You’re hurting me, I tell you! and you’re tearing my frock!” Then it happed that Sir Kay, hurtling to the rescue, stopped short in his stride, catching sight suddenly, through apple-boughs, of a gleam of scarlet afar off; while the confused tramp of many horses, mingled with talk and laughter, was borne to our ears.",more country story mail clad knight pace shaw quest adventure redress wrong bandit break flead discomfite cave damsel rescue dragon disembowell giant corner orchard deprive superfluous number head wait vanish flight skilled spear terror bane list dight gay shimmer silk gold earth shake thunder horse ash stave fly splinter firmament ring clash sword helm vary fortune day swing doubtful side last grim great thrust press unhors easy task bestrode threaten doom knight forget win fame old cry hurt tell tear frock happ hurtle rescue stop short stride catching sight apple bough gleam scarlet confuse tramp many horse mingle talk laughter borne ear 
13,"“What is it?” inquired Tristram, sitting up and shaking out her curls; while Lancelot forsook the clanging lists and trotted nimbly to the hedge.",inquire sit shake curl forsook clanging list trotet hedge 
14,"I stood spell-bound for a moment longer, and then, with a cry of “Soldiers!” I was off to the hedge, Charlotte picking herself up and scurrying after.",stand spell bound moment cry soldier hedge pick scurry 
15,"Down the road they came, two and two, at an easy walk; scarlet flamed in the eye, bits jingled and saddles squeaked delightfully; while the men, in a halo of dust, smoked their short clays like the heroes they were. In a swirl of intoxicating glory the troop clinked and clattered by, while we shouted and waved, jumping up and down, and the big jolly horsemen acknowledged the salute with easy condescension. The moment they were past we were through the hedge and after them. Soldiers were not the common stuff of everyday life. There had been nothing like this since the winter before last, when on a certain afternoon--bare of leaf and monochrome in its hue of sodden fallow and frost-nipt copse--suddenly the hounds had burst through the fence with their mellow cry, and all the paddock was for the minute reverberant of thudding hoof and dotted with glancing red. But this was better, since it could only mean that blows and bloodshed were in the air.",road come easy walk scarlet flame eye bit jingle saddle squeak man halo dust smoke short clay hero swirl intoxicating glory troop clink clatter shout wave jump big jolly horsemen acknowledge salute easy condescension moment past hedge soldier common stuff everyday life be winter last certain afternoon bare leaf monochrome hue sodden fallow frost nipt copse hound burst fence mellow cry paddock minute reverberant thudd hoof dot glancing red good mean blow bloodshed air 
16,"“Is there going to be a battle?” panted Harold, hardly able to keep up for excitement.",go be battle pant able keep excitement 
17,"“Of course there is,” I replied. “We’re just in time. Come on!”",course be reply time come 
18,"Perhaps I ought to have known better; and yet---- The pigs and poultry, with whom we chiefly consorted, could instruct us little concerning the peace that in these latter days lapped this sea-girt realm. In the schoolroom we were just now dallying with the Wars of the Roses; and did not legends of the country-side inform us how Cavaliers had once galloped up and down these very lanes from their quarters in the village? Here, now, were soldiers unmistakable; and if their business was not fighting, what was it? Sniffing the joy of battle, we followed hard on their tracks.",know good pig poultry consort instruct little concern peace latter day lap sea girt realm schoolroom dally legend country side inform gallop very lane quarter village soldier unmistakable business fight sniff joy battle follow track 
19,"“Won’t Edward be sorry,” puffed Harold, “that he’s begun that beastly Latin?”",sorry puff begin beastly 
20,"It did, indeed, seem hard. Edward, the most martial spirit of us all, was drearily conjugating AMO (of all verbs) between four walls; while Selina, who ever thrilled ecstatic to a red coat, was struggling with the uncouth German tongue. “Age,” I reflected, “carries its penalties.”",seem hard martial spirit conjugate verb wall thrill ecstatic red coat struggle uncouth german tongue age reflect carry penalty 
21,"It was a grievous disappointment to us that the troop passed through the village unmolested. Every cottage, I pointed out to my companions, ought to have been loopholed, and strongly held. But no opposition was offered to the soldiers, who, indeed, conducted themselves with a recklessness and a want of precaution that seemed simply criminal.",grievous disappointment troop pass village unmolested cottage point companion loophol hold opposition offer soldier conduct recklessness want precaution seem criminal 
22,"At the last cottage a transitory gleam of common sense flickered across me, and, turning on Charlotte, I sternly ordered her back.",last cottage transitory gleam common sense flicker turn order 
23,"The small maiden, docile but exceedingly dolorous, dragged reluctant feet homewards, heavy at heart that she was to behold no stout fellows slain that day; but Harold and I held steadily on, expecting every instant to see the environing hedges crackle and spit forth the leaden death.",small maiden docile dolorous drag reluctant foot homeward heavy heart behold stout fellow slain day hold expect instant see environing hedge crackle spit leaden death 
24,"“Will they be Indians?” inquired my brother (meaning the enemy); “or Roundheads, or what?”",inquire brother mean enemy 
25,"I reflected. Harold always required direct, straightforward answers--not faltering suppositions.",reflect require direct straightforward answer falter supposition 
26,"“They won’t be Indians,” I replied at last; “nor yet Roundheads. There haven’t been any Roundheads seen about here for a long time. They’ll be Frenchmen.”",reply last be see long time 
27,"Harold’s face fell. “All right,” he said; “Frenchmen’ll do; but I did hope they’d be Indians.”",face fall right say do hope 
28,"“If they were going to be Indians,” I explained, “I--I don’t think I’d go on. Because when Indians take you prisoner they scalp you first, and then burn you at a stake. But Frenchmen don’t do that sort of thing.”",go explain think go take prisoner scalp burn stake do sort thing 
29,“Are you quite sure?” asked Harold doubtfully.,sure ask 
30,"“Quite,” I replied. “Frenchmen only shut you up in a thing called the Bastille; and then you get a file sent in to you in a loaf of bread, and saw the bars through, and slide down a rope, and they all fire at you--but they don’t hit you--and you run down to the seashore as hard as you can, and swim off to a British frigate, and there you are!”",quite reply shut thing call get file send loaf bread see bar slide rope fire hit run seashore swim british frigate 
31,Harold brightened up again. The programme was rather attractive.,brighten programme attractive 
32,"“If they try to take us prisoner,” he said, “we--we won’t run, will we?”",try take prisoner say run 
33,"Meanwhile, the craven foe was a long time showing himself; and we were reaching strange outland country, uncivilised, wherein lions might be expected to prowl at nightfall. I had a stitch in my side, and both Harold’s stockings had come down. Just as I was beginning to have gloomy doubts of the proverbial courage of Frenchmen, the officer called out something, the men closed up, and, breaking into a trot, the troops--already far ahead--vanished out of our sight. With a sinking at the heart, I began to suspect we had been fooled.",craven foe long time show reach strange outland country uncivilised lion expect prowl nightfall have stitch side stocking come begin have gloomy doubt proverbial courage officer call man close break trot troops vanish sight sinking heart begin suspect fool 
34,"“Are they charging?” cried Harold, weary, but rallying gamely.",charge cry weary rallying 
35,"“I think not,” I replied doubtfully. “When there’s going to be a charge, the officer always makes a speech, and then they draw their swords and the trumpets blow, and--but let’s try a short cut. We may catch them up yet.”",think reply go be charge officer make speech draw sword trumpet blow let try short cut catch 
36,"So we struck across the fields and into another road, and pounded down that, and then over more fields, panting, down-hearted, yet hoping for the best. The sun went in, and a thin drizzle began to fall; we were muddy, breathless, almost dead beat; but we blundered on, till at last we struck a road more brutally, more callously unfamiliar than any road I ever looked upon. Not a hint nor a sign of friendly direction or assistance on the dogged white face of it. There was no longer any disguising it--we were hopelessly lost. The small rain continued steadily, the evening began to come on. Really there are moments when a fellow is justified in crying; and I would have cried too, if Harold had not been there. That right-minded child regarded an elder brother as a veritable god; and I could see that he felt himself as secure as if a whole Brigade of Guards hedged him round with protecting bayonets. But I dreaded sore lest he should begin again with his questions.",strike field road pound more field pant hearted hope good sun go thin drizzle begin fall muddy breathless dead beat blunder last strike road unfamiliar road look hint sign friendly direction assistance dogg white face be disguise lose small rain continue evening begin come be moment fellow justify cry cry right minded child regard elder brother veritable god see feel secure whole hedge protect bayonet dread sore begin question 
37,"As I gazed in dumb appeal on the face of unresponsive nature, the sound of nearing wheels sent a pulse of hope through my being; increasing to rapture as I recognised in the approaching vehicle the familiar carriage of the old doctor. If ever a god emerged from a machine, it was when this heaven-sent friend, recognising us, stopped and jumped out with a cheery hail. Harold rushed up to him at once. “Have you been there?” he cried. “Was it a jolly fight? who beat? were there many people killed?”",gaze dumb appeal face unresponsive nature sound near wheel send pulse hope being increase rapture recognise approach vehicle familiar carriage old doctor god emerge machine heaven send friend recognise stop jump cheery hail rush cry jolly fight beat be many person kill 
38,The doctor appeared puzzled. I briefly explained the situation.,doctor appear puzzle explain situation 
39,"“I see,” said the doctor, looking grave and twisting his face this way and that. “Well, the fact is, there isn’t going to be any battle to-day. It’s been put off, on account of the change in the weather. You will have due notice of the renewal of hostilities. And now you’d better jump in and I’ll drive you home. You’ve been running a fine rig! Why, you might have both been taken and shot as spies!”",see say doctor look grave twist face way fact go be battle day put account change weather have due notice renewal hostility jump drive run fine rig take shoot spy 
40,"This special danger had never even occurred to us. The thrill of it accentuated the cosey homelike feeling of the cushions we nestled into as we rolled homewards. The doctor beguiled the journey with blood-curdling narratives of personal adventure in the tented field, he having followed the profession of arms (so it seemed) in every quarter of the globe. Time, the destroyer of all things beautiful, subsequently revealed the baselessness of these legends; but what of that? There are higher things than truth; and we were almost reconciled, by the time we were dropped at our gate, to the fact that the battle had been postponed.",special danger occur thrill accentuate cosey homelike feeling cushion nestle roll homeward doctor beguil journey blood curdling narrative personal adventure tent field follow profession arm seem quarter globe time destroyer thing beautiful reveal baselessness legend be high thing truth reconcile time drop gate fact battle postpone
