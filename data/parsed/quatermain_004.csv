3,"We made the remains of our rope fast to the other canoe, and sat waiting for the dawn and congratulating ourselves upon our merciful escape, which really seemed to result more from the special favour of Providence than from our own care or prowess. At last it came, and I have not often been more grateful to see the light, though so far as my canoe was concerned it revealed a ghastly sight. There in the bottom of the little boat lay the unfortunate Askari, the sime, or sword, in his bosom, and the severed hand gripping the handle. I could not bear the sight, so hauling up the stone which had served as an anchor to the other canoe, we made it fast to the murdered man and dropped him overboard, and down he went to the bottom, leaving nothing but a train of bubbles behind him. Alas! when our time comes, most of us like him leave nothing but bubbles behind, to show that we have been, and the bubbles soon burst. The hand of his murderer we threw into the stream, where it slowly sank. The sword, of which the handle was ivory, inlaid with gold (evidently Arab work), I kept and used as a hunting-knife, and very useful it proved.",make remains rope other canoe sit wait dawn congratulate merciful escape seem result special favour own care prowess last come grateful see light canoe concerned reveal ghastly sight bottom little boat lay unfortunate sime sword bosom sever hand grip handle bear sight haul stone serve anchor other canoe make murder man drop go bottom leave train bubble time come most like leave bubble show bubble burst hand murderer throw stream sink sword handle ivory inlaid gold arab work keep use hunting knife useful prove 
4,"Then, a man having been transferred to my canoe, we once more started on in very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future, but fondly hoping to arrive at the ‘Highlands’ station by night. To make matters worse, within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents, wetting us to the skin, and even necessitating the occasional baling of the canoes, and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the sails, and had to get along as best as we could with our paddles.",man transfer canoe start low spirit feel comfortable future hope arrive station night make matter bad hour sunrise come rain torrent wet skin necessitate occasional bale canoe rain beat wind use sail have get good paddle 
5,"At eleven o’clock we halted on an open piece of ground on the left bank of the river, and, the rain abating a little, managed to make a fire and catch and broil some fish. We did not dare to wander about to search for game. At two o’clock we got off again, taking a supply of broiled fish with us, and shortly afterwards the rain came on harder than ever. Also the river began to get exceedingly difficult to navigate on account of the numerous rocks, reaches of shallow water, and the increased force of the current; so that it soon became clear to us that we should not reach the Rev. Mackenzie’s hospitable roof that night--a prospect that did not tend to enliven us. Toil as we would, we could not make more than an average of a mile an hour, and at five o’clock in the afternoon (by which time we were all utterly worn out) we reckoned that we were still quite ten miles below the station. This being so, we set to work to make the best arrangements we could for the night. After our recent experience, we simply did not dare to land, more especially as the banks of the Tana were clothed with dense bush that would have given cover to five thousand Masai, and at first I thought that we were going to have another night of it in the canoes. Fortunately, however, we espied a little rocky islet, not more than fifteen miles or so square, situated nearly in the middle of the river. For this we paddled, and, making fast the canoes, landed and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would permit, which was very uncomfortable indeed. As for the weather, it continued to be simply vile, the rain coming down in sheets till we were chilled to the marrow, and utterly preventing us from lighting a fire. There was, however, one consoling circumstance about this rain; our Askari declared that nothing would induce the Masai to make an attack in it, as they intensely disliked moving about in the wet, perhaps, as Good suggested, because they hate the idea of washing. We ate some insipid and sodden cold fish--that is, with the exception of Umslopogaas, who, like most Zulus, cannot bear fish--and took a pull of brandy, of which we fortunately had a few bottles left, and then began what, with one exception--when we same three white men nearly perished of cold on the snow of Sheba’s Breast in the course of our journey to Kukuanaland--was, I think, the most trying night I ever experienced. It seemed absolutely endless, and once or twice I feared that two of the Askari would have died of the wet, cold, and exposure. Indeed, had it not been for timely doses of brandy I am sure that they would have died, for no African people can stand much exposure, which first paralyses and then kills them. I could see that even that iron old warrior Umslopogaas felt it keenly; though, in strange contrast to the Wakwafis, who groaned and bemoaned their fate unceasingly, he never uttered a single complaint. To make matters worse, about one in the morning we again heard the owl’s ominous hooting, and had at once to prepare ourselves for another attack; though, if it had been attempted, I do not think that we could have offered a very effective resistance. But either the owl was a real one this time, or else the Masai were themselves too miserable to think of offensive operations, which, indeed, they rarely, if ever, undertake in bush veldt. At any rate, we saw nothing of them.",o'clock halt open piece ground left bank river rain abate little manage make fire catch broil fish dare wander search game o'clock get take supply broil fish rain come hard river begin get difficult navigate account numerous rock reach shallow water increase force current become clear reach hospitable roof night prospect tend enlive toil make more average mile hour o'clock afternoon time wear reckon mile station set work make good arrangement night recent experience dare land bank cloth dense bush give cover first think go have night canoe espy little rocky islet more mile square situate middle river paddle make canoe land make comfortable circumstance permit uncomfortable weather continue vile rain come sheet chill marrow prevent light fire be consol circumstance rain declare induce make attack dislike move wet suggest hate idea washing eat insipid sodden cold fish exception most bear fish take pull brandy have few bottle leave begin exception same white man perish cold snow course journey think try night experience seem endless fear die wet cold exposure timely dose brandy sure die african person stand much exposure first paralyse kill see iron old warrior feel strange contrast groan bemoan fate utter single complaint make matter bad morning hear owl ominous hooting have prepare attack attempt think offer effective resistance owl real one time miserable think offensive operation undertake veldt rate see 
6,"At last the dawn came gliding across the water, wrapped in wreaths of ghostly mist, and, with the daylight, the rain ceased; and then, out came the glorious sun, sucking up the mists and warming the chill air. Benumbed, and utterly exhausted, we dragged ourselves to our feet, and went and stood in the bright rays, and were thankful for them. I can quite understand how it is that primitive people become sun worshippers, especially if their conditions of life render them liable to exposure.",last dawn come glide water wrap wreath ghostly mist daylight rain cease come glorious sun suck mist warm chill air exhaust drag foot go stand bright ray thankful understand primitive person become sun worshipper condition life render liable exposure 
7,"In half an hour more we were once again making fair progress with the help of a good wind. Our spirits had returned with the sunshine, and we were ready to laugh at difficulties and dangers that had been almost crushing on the previous day.",hour make fair progress help good wind spirit return sunshine ready laugh difficulty danger crush previous day 
8,"And so we went on cheerily till about eleven o’clock. Just as we were thinking of halting as usual, to rest and try to shoot something to eat, a sudden bend in the river brought us in sight of a substantial-looking European house with a veranda round it, splendidly situated upon a hill, and surrounded by a high stone wall with a ditch on the outer side. Right against and overshadowing the house was an enormous pine, the top of which we had seen through a glass for the last two days, but of course without knowing that it marked the site of the mission station. I was the first to see the house, and could not restrain myself from giving a hearty cheer, in which the others, including the natives, joined lustily. There was no thought of halting now. On we laboured, for, unfortunately, though the house seemed quite near, it was still a long way off by river, until at last, by one o’clock, we found ourselves at the bottom of the slope on which the building stood. Running the canoes to the bank, we disembarked, and were just hauling them up on to the shore, when we perceived three figures, dressed in ordinary English-looking clothes, hurrying down through a grove of trees to meet us.",go o'clock think halt usual rest try shoot eat sudden bend river bring sight substantial look european house veranda situate hill surround high stone wall ditch outer side right overshadow house enormous pine top see glass last day course know mark site mission station first see house restrain give hearty cheer other include native join be thought halt laboure house seem long way river last o'clock find bottom slope building stand runn canoe bank disembark haul shore perceive figure dress ordinary english look clothes hurry grove tree meet 
9,"‘A gentleman, a lady, and a little girl,’ ejaculated Good, after surveying the trio through his eyeglass, ‘walking in a civilized fashion, through a civilized garden, to meet us in this place. Hang me, if this isn’t the most curious thing we have seen yet!’",gentleman lady little girl ejaculate good survey trio eyeglass walk civilized fashion civilized garden meet place hang curious thing see 
10,"Good was right: it certainly did seem odd and out of place--more like a scene out of a dream or an Italian opera than a real tangible fact; and the sense of unreality was not lessened when we heard ourselves addressed in good broad Scotch, which, however, I cannot reproduce.",good right seem odd place scene dream italian opera real tangible fact sense unreality lessen hear address good broad reproduce 
11,"‘How do you do, sirs,’ said Mr Mackenzie, a grey-haired, angular man, with a kindly face and red cheeks; ‘I hope I see you very well. My natives told me an hour ago they spied two canoes with white men in them coming up the river; so we have just come down to meet you.’",do say grey haired angular man kindly face red cheek hope see native tell hour spy canoe white man come river come meet

13,"We took off our hats in acknowledgment, and proceeded to introduce ourselves.",take hat acknowledgment proceed introduce 
14,"‘And now,’ said Mr Mackenzie, ‘you must all be hungry and weary; so come on, gentlemen, come on, and right glad we are to see you. The last white who visited us was Alphonse--you will see Alphonse presently--and that was a year ago.’",say hungry weary come gentleman come glad see last white visit see year 
15,"Meanwhile we had been walking up the slope of the hill, the lower portion of which was fenced off, sometimes with quince fences and sometimes with rough stone walls, into Kaffir gardens, just now full of crops of mealies, pumpkins, potatoes, etc. In the corners of these gardens were groups of neat mushroom-shaped huts, occupied by Mr Mackenzie’s mission natives, whose women and children came pouring out to meet us as we walked. Through the centre of the gardens ran the roadway up which we were walking. It was bordered on each side by a line of orange trees, which, although they had only been planted ten years, had in the lovely climate of the uplands below Mt Kenia, the base of which is about 5,000 feet above the coastline level, already grown to imposing proportions, and were positively laden with golden fruit. After a stiffish climb of a quarter of a mile or so--for the hillside was steep--we came to a splendid quince fence, also covered with fruit, which enclosed, Mr Mackenzie told us, a space of about four acres of ground that contained his private garden, house, church, and outbuildings, and, indeed, the whole hilltop. And what a garden it was! I have always loved a good garden, and I could have thrown up my hands for joy when I saw Mr Mackenzie’s. First there were rows upon rows of standard European fruit-trees, all grafted; for on top of this hill the climate was so temperate that nearly all the English vegetables, trees, and flowers flourished luxuriantly, even including several varieties of the apple, which, generally, runs to wood in a warm climate and obstinately refuses to fruit. Then there were strawberries and tomatoes (such tomatoes!), and melons and cucumbers, and, indeed, every sort of vegetable and fruit.",walk slope hill low portion fence quince fence rough stone wall garden full crop mealy pumpkin potato etc. corner garden group neat mushroom shape hut occupy mission native woman child come pour meet walk centre garden run roadway walk border side line orange tree plant year have lovely climate upland base foot coastline level grow impose proportion laden golden fruit stiffish climb quarter mile hillside steep come splendid quince fence cover fruit enclose tell space acre ground contain private garden house church outbuilding whole hilltop garden love good garden throw hand joy see be row row standard european fruit tree graft top hill climate temperate english vegetable tree flower flourish include several variety apple run wood warm climate refuse fruit be strawberry tomato such tomato melon cucumber sort vegetable fruit

17,"‘Yes,’ answered the missionary, ‘it is a very good garden, and has well repaid my labour; but it is the climate that I have to thank. If you stick a peach-stone into the ground it will bear fruit the fourth year, and a rose-cutting will bloom in a year. It is a lovely clime.’",answer missionary good garden repaid labour climate have thank stick peach stone ground bear fruit fourth year rose cutting bloom year lovely clime 
18,"Just then we came to a ditch about ten feet wide, and full of water, on the other side of which was a loopholed stone wall eight feet high, and with sharp flints plentifully set in mortar on the coping.",come ditch foot wide full water other side loopholed stone wall foot high sharp flint set mortar coping 
19,"‘There,’ said Mr Mackenzie, pointing to the ditch and wall, ‘this is my magnum opus; at least, this and the church, which is the other side of the house. It took me and twenty natives two years to dig the ditch and build the wall, but I never felt safe till it was done; and now I can defy all the savages in Africa, for the spring that fills the ditch is inside the wall, and bubbles out at the top of the hill winter and summer alike, and I always keep a store of four months’ provision in the house.’",say point ditch wall magnum opus least church other side house take native year dig ditch build wall feel safe do defy savage spring fill ditch wall bubble top hill winter summer keep store month provision house 
20,"Crossing over a plank and through a very narrow opening in the wall, we entered into what Mrs Mackenzie called _her_ domain--namely, the flower garden, the beauty of which is really beyond my power to describe. I do not think I ever saw such roses, gardenias, or camellias (all reared from seeds or cuttings sent from England); and there was also a patch given up to a collection of bulbous roots mostly collected by Miss Flossie, Mr Mackenzie’s little daughter, from the surrounding country, some of which were surpassingly beautiful. In the middle of this garden, and exactly opposite the veranda, a beautiful fountain of clear water bubbled up from the ground, and fell into a stone-work basin which had been carefully built to receive it, whence the overflow found its way by means of a drain to the moat round the outer wall, this moat in its turn serving as a reservoir, whence an unfailing supply of water was available to irrigate all the gardens below. The house itself, a massively built single-storied building, was roofed with slabs of stone, and had a handsome veranda in front. It was built on three sides of a square, the fourth side being taken up by the kitchens, which stood separate from the house--a very good plan in a hot country. In the centre of this square thus formed was, perhaps, the most remarkable object that we had yet seen in this charming place, and that was a single tree of the conifer tribe, varieties of which grow freely on the highlands of this part of Africa. This splendid tree, which Mr Mackenzie informed us was a landmark for fifty miles round, and which we had ourselves seen for the last forty miles of our journey, must have been nearly three hundred feet in height, the trunk measuring about sixteen feet in diameter at a yard from the ground. For some seventy feet it rose a beautiful tapering brown pillar without a single branch, but at that height splendid dark green boughs, which, looked at from below, had the appearance of gigantic fern-leaves, sprang out horizontally from the trunk, projecting right over the house and flower-garden, to both of which they furnished a grateful proportion of shade, without--being so high up--offering any impediment to the passage of light and air.",cross plank narrow opening wall enter call _her_ domain flower garden beauty power describe think see such rose gardenias camellias rear seed cutting send be patch give collection bulbous root collect little daughter surround country beautiful middle garden veranda beautiful fountain clear water bubble ground fall stone work basin build receive overflow find way means drain moat outer wall moat turn serve reservoir unfailing supply water available irrigate garden house build single story building roof slab stone have handsome veranda front build side square fourth side take kitchen stand separate house good plan hot country centre square form remarkable object see charming place single tree conifer tribe variety grow highland part splendid tree inform landmark mile have see last mile journey foot height trunk measure foot diameter yard ground foot rise beautiful taper brown pillar single branch height splendid dark green bough look have appearance gigantic fern leave spring trunk project house flower garden furnish grateful proportion shade high offer impediment passage light air 
21,‘What a beautiful tree!’ exclaimed Sir Henry.,beautiful tree exclaim 
22,"‘Yes, you are right; it is a beautiful tree. There is not another like it in all the country round, that I know of,’ answered Mr Mackenzie. ‘I call it my watch tower. As you see, I have a rope ladder fixed to the lowest bough; and if I want to see anything that is going on within fifteen miles or so, all I have to do is to run up it with a spyglass. But you must be hungry, and I am sure the dinner is cooked. Come in, my friends; it is but a rough place, but well enough for these savage parts; and I can tell you what, we have got--a French cook.’ And he led the way on to the veranda.",right beautiful tree be country know answer call watch tower see have rope ladder fix low bough want see go mile have do run spyglass hungry sure dinner cook come friend rough place savage part tell get french cook lead way veranda 
23,"As I was following him, and wondering what on earth he could mean by this, there suddenly appeared, through the door that opened on to the veranda from the house, a dapper little man, dressed in a neat blue cotton suit, with shoes made of tanned hide, and remarkable for a bustling air and most enormous black mustachios, shaped into an upward curve, and coming to a point for all the world like a pair of buffalo-horns.",follow wonder earth mean appear door open veranda house dapper little man dress neat blue cotton suit shoe make tann hide remarkable bustle air enormous black mustachios shape upward curve come point world pair buffalo horn 
24,"‘Madame bids me for to say that dinnar is sarved.

Take but note of his huge choppare and the great pit in his head.’",bid say dinnar sarve compliment perceive loiter play battleaxe throw hand astonishment ejaculate take note huge choppare great pit head

31,"‘Oh,’ answered Mrs Mackenzie, ‘he arrived here of his own accord about a year ago, and asked to be taken into our service. He had got into some trouble in France, and fled to Zanzibar, where he found an application had been made by the French Government for his extradition. Whereupon he rushed off up-country, and fell in, when nearly starved, with our caravan of men, who were bringing us our annual supply of goods, and was brought on here. You should get him to tell you the story.’",answer arrive own accord year ask take service get trouble flead find application make french extradition rush country fall starve caravan man bring annual supply goods bring get tell story

33,"‘It is evident to me,’ he said, ‘that those rascally Masai are following you, and I am very thankful that you have reached this house in safety. I do not think that they will dare to attack you here. It is unfortunate, though, that nearly all my men have gone down to the coast with ivory and goods. There are two hundred of them in the caravan, and the consequence is that I have not more than twenty men available for defensive purposes in case they should attack us. But, still, I will just give a few orders;’ and, calling a black man who was loitering about outside in the garden, he went to the window, and addressed him in a Swahili dialect. The man listened, and then saluted and departed.",evident say rascally follow thankful reach house safety think dare attack unfortunate man go coast ivory goods be caravan consequence have more man available defensive purpose case attack give few order call black man loiter garden go window address swahili dialect man listen salute depart

37,"Mr Mackenzie, by way of answer, went out of the room and returned, bringing with him a most curious sword. It was long, and all the blade, which was very thick and heavy, was to within a quarter of an inch of the cutting edge worked into an ornamental pattern exactly as we work soft wood with a fret-saw, the steel, however, being invariably pierced in such a way as not to interfere with the strength of the sword. This in itself was sufficiently curious, but what was still more so was that all the edges of the hollow spaces cut through the substance of the blade were most beautifully inlaid with gold, which was in some way that I cannot understand welded on to the steel {Endnote 5}.",way answer go room return bring curious sword long blade thick heavy quarter inch cutting edge work ornamental pattern work soft wood fret see steel pierce way interfere strength sword curious edge hollow space cut substance blade inlaid gold way understand weld steel }

Look here; I will tell you all that I know about the matter, which is not much. One afternoon, just before sunset, I was sitting on the veranda, when a poor, miserable, starved-looking man came limping up and squatted down before me. I asked him where he came from and what he wanted, and thereon he plunged into a long rambling narrative about how he belonged to a tribe far in the north, and how his tribe was destroyed by another tribe, and he with a few other survivors driven still further north past a lake named Laga. Thence, it appears, he made his way to another lake that lay up in the mountains, “a lake without a bottom”  he called it, and here his wife and brother died of an infectious sickness--probably smallpox--whereon the people drove him out of their villages into the wilderness, where he wandered miserably over mountains for ten days, after which he got into dense thorn forest, and was one day found there by some _white men_ who were hunting, and who took him to a place where all the people were white and lived in stone houses. Here he remained a week shut up in a house, till one night a man with a white beard, whom he understood to be a “medicine-man”, came and inspected him, after which he was led off and taken through the thorn forest to the confines of the wilderness, and given food and this sword (at least so he said), and turned loose.’",get show man say see white person bring do more give air truth set lie look tell know matter much afternoon sunset sit veranda poor miserable starve look man come limp squatet ask come want plunge long ramble narrative belong tribe north tribe destroy tribe few other survivor drive lake name thence appear make way lake lay mountain lake bottom call wife brother die infectious sickness smallpox person drive village wilderness wander mountain day get dense thorn forest day find _white men_ hunt take place person white live stone house remain week shut house night man white beard understand medicine man come inspect lead take thorn forest confines wilderness give food sword least say turn

What the details of his journey were I never learnt, for I told him to return on the morrow, bidding one of my headmen look after him for the night. The headman took him away, but the poor man had the itch so badly that the headman’s wife would not have him in the hut for fear of catching it, so he was given a blanket and told to sleep outside. As it happened, we had a lion hanging about here just then, and most unhappily he winded this unfortunate wanderer, and, springing on him, bit his head almost off without the people in the hut knowing anything about it, and there was an end of him and his story about the white people; and whether or no there is any truth in it is more than I can tell you.
