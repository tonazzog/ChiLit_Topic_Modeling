2," Bobbie knew the secret now. A sheet of old newspaper wrapped round a parcel--just a little chance like that--had given the secret to her. And she had to go down to tea and pretend that there was nothing the matter. The pretence was bravely made, but it wasn’t very successful.",know secret sheet old newspaper wrap parcel little chance give secret have go tea pretend be matter pretence make successful

8,"Tea was not a cheerful meal. Peter was so distressed by the obvious fact that something horrid had happened to Bobbie that he limited his speech to repeating, “More bread and butter, please,” at startlingly short intervals. Phyllis stroked her sister’s hand under the table to express sympathy, and knocked her cup over as she did it. Fetching a cloth and wiping up the spilt milk helped Bobbie a little. But she thought that tea would never end. Yet at last it did end, as all things do at last, and when Mother took out the tray, Bobbie followed her.",tea cheerful meal distress obvious fact horrid happen limit speech repeat more bread butter short interval stroke sister hand table express sympathy knock cup do fetch cloth wipe spilt milk help little think tea end last end thing do last mother take tray follow

15,"All through tea she had been thinking of what to say; she had decided that “I know all,” or “All is known to me,” or “The terrible secret is a secret no longer,” would be the proper thing. But now that she and her Mother and that awful sheet of newspaper were alone in the room together, she found that she could say nothing.",tea think say decide know know terrible secret secret proper thing mother awful sheet newspaper alone room find say

30,"So then, sitting cuddled up close to her Mother, Bobbie heard “all about it.” She heard how those men, who had asked to see Father on that remembered last night when the Engine was being mended, had come to arrest him, charging him with selling State secrets to the Russians--with being, in fact, a spy and a traitor. She heard about the trial, and about the evidence--letters, found in Father’s desk at the office, letters that convinced the jury that Father was guilty.",sit cuddle mother hear hear man ask see remember last night engine mend come arrest charge sell state secret fact spy traitor hear trial evidence letter find desk office letter convince jury guilty

45,"The other two were very gentle and kind to Bobbie. And they did not ask her what was the matter. This was Peter’s idea, and he had drilled Phyllis, who would have asked a hundred questions if she had been left to herself.",other gentle kind ask matter idea drill ask question leave

47,"“My dear Friend,” she said, “you see what is in this paper. It is not true. Father never did it. Mother says someone put the papers in Father’s desk, and she says the man under him that got Father’s place afterwards was jealous of Father, and Father suspected him a long time. But nobody listens to a word she says, but you are so good and clever, and you found out about the Russian gentleman’s wife directly. Can’t you find out who did the treason because he wasn’t Father upon my honour; he is an Englishman and uncapable to do such things, and then they would let Father out of prison. It is dreadful, and Mother is getting so thin. She told us once to pray for all prisoners and captives. I see now. Oh, do help me--there is only just Mother and me know, and we can’t do anything.

56,"“What on earth?” she asked as she reached the wall-top--for Phyllis and Peter were very muddy. A lump of wet clay lay between them on the wall, they had each a slip of slate in a very dirty hand, and behind Peter, out of the reach of accidents, were several strange rounded objects rather like very fat sausages, hollow, but closed up at one end.",earth ask reach wall top muddy lump wet clay lay wall have slip slate dirty hand reach accident several strange round object fat sausages hollow close end

81,The paperchase was found to be a more amusing subject of conversation than the reading powers of swallows. Bobbie had hoped it might be. And next morning Mother let them take their lunch and go out for the day to see the paperchase.,paperchase find amusing subject conversation reading power swallow hope next morning mother let take lunch go day see paperchase

83,"Of course it had taken some time to get the line clear from the rocks and earth and trees that had fallen on it when the great landslip happened. That was the occasion, you will remember, when the three children saved the train from being wrecked by waving six little red-flannel-petticoat flags. It is always interesting to watch people working, especially when they work with such interesting things as spades and picks and shovels and planks and barrows, when they have cindery red fires in iron pots with round holes in them, and red lamps hanging near the works at night. Of course the children were never out at night; but once, at dusk, when Peter had got out of his bedroom skylight on to the roof, he had seen the red lamp shining far away at the edge of the cutting. The children had often been down to watch the work, and this day the interest of picks and spades, and barrows being wheeled along planks, completely put the paperchase out of their heads, so that they quite jumped when a voice just behind them panted, “Let me pass, please.” It was the hare--a big-boned, loose-limbed boy, with dark hair lying flat on a very damp forehead. The bag of torn paper under his arm was fastened across one shoulder by a strap. The children stood back. The hare ran along the line, and the workmen leaned on their picks to watch him. He ran on steadily and disappeared into the mouth of the tunnel.",course take time get line clear rock earth tree fall great landslip happen occasion remember child save train wreck wave little red flannel petticoat flag interesting watch person work work such interesting thing spade pick shovel plank barrow have cindery red fire iron pot round hole red lamp hang work night course child night dusk get bedroom skylight roof see red lamp shine edge cutting child watch work day interest pick spade barrow wheel plank put paperchase head jump voice pant let pass hare big bon loose limb boy dark hair lie flat damp forehead bag tear paper arm fasten shoulder strap child stand hare run line workmen learn pick watch run disappear mouth tunnel

93,"And now, following the track of the hare by the little white blots of scattered paper, came the hounds. There were thirty of them, and they all came down the steep, ladder-like steps by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens. Bobbie and Phyllis and Peter counted them as they passed. The foremost ones hesitated a moment at the foot of the ladder, then their eyes caught the gleam of scattered whiteness along the line and they turned towards the tunnel, and, by ones and twos and threes and sixes and sevens, disappeared in the dark mouth of it. The last one, in a red jersey, seemed to be extinguished by the darkness like a candle that is blown out.",follow track hare little white blot scatter paper come hound be come steep ladder step one two three sixe seven count pass foremost one hesitate moment foot ladder eye catch gleam scatter whiteness line turn tunnel one two three sixe seven disappear dark mouth last one red jersey seem extinguish darkness candle blow

146,"Of course you know what going into a tunnel is like? The engine gives a scream and then suddenly the noise of the running, rattling train changes and grows different and much louder. Grown-up people pull up the windows and hold them by the strap. The railway carriage suddenly grows like night--with lamps, of course, unless you are in a slow local train, in which case lamps are not always provided. Then by and by the darkness outside the carriage window is touched by puffs of cloudy whiteness, then you see a blue light on the walls of the tunnel, then the sound of the moving train changes once more, and you are out in the good open air again, and grown-ups let the straps go. The windows, all dim with the yellow breath of the tunnel, rattle down into their places, and you see once more the dip and catch of the telegraph wires beside the line, and the straight-cut hawthorn hedges with the tiny baby trees growing up out of them every thirty yards.",course know go tunnel engine give scream noise running rattling train change grow different louder grow person pull window hold strap railway carriage grow night lamp course slow local train case lamp provide darkness carriage window touch puff cloudy whiteness see blue light wall tunnel sound move train change more good open air grow up let strap go window dim yellow breath tunnel rattle place see dip catch telegraph wire line straight cut hawthorn hedge tiny baby tree grow yard 
147,"All this, of course, is what a tunnel means when you are in a train. But everything is quite different when you walk into a tunnel on your own feet, and tread on shifting, sliding stones and gravel on a path that curves downwards from the shining metals to the wall. Then you see slimy, oozy trickles of water running down the inside of the tunnel, and you notice that the bricks are not red or brown, as they are at the tunnel’s mouth, but dull, sticky, sickly green. Your voice, when you speak, is quite changed from what it was out in the sunshine, and it is a long time before the tunnel is quite dark.",course tunnel mean train different walk tunnel own foot tread shifting slide stone gravel path curve shine metal wall see slimy oozy trickle water run inside tunnel notice brick red brown tunnel mouth dull sticky sickly green voice speak change sunshine long time tunnel dark

156,"“Come on,” shouted Peter, who was a few yards ahead. “Quick! Manhole!”",come shout few yard quick 
157,"The roar of the advancing train was now louder than the noise you hear when your head is under water in the bath and both taps are running, and you are kicking with your heels against the bath’s tin sides. But Peter had shouted for all he was worth, and Bobbie heard him. She dragged Phyllis along to the manhole. Phyllis, of course, stumbled over the wires and grazed both her legs. But they dragged her in, and all three stood in the dark, damp, arched recess while the train roared louder and louder. It seemed as if it would deafen them. And, in the distance, they could see its eyes of fire growing bigger and brighter every instant.",roar advance train louder noise hear head water bath tap run kick heel bath tin side shout worth hear drag manhole course stumble wire graze leg drag stand dark damp arched recess train roar louder louder seem deaf distance see eye fire grow big bright instant

159,"And now, with a rush and a roar and a rattle and a long dazzling flash of lighted carriage windows, a smell of smoke, and blast of hot air, the train hurtled by, clanging and jangling and echoing in the vaulted roof of the tunnel. Phyllis and Bobbie clung to each other. Even Peter caught hold of Bobbie’s arm, “in case she should be frightened,” as he explained afterwards.",rush roar rattle long dazzling flash light carriage window smell smoke blast hot air train hurtle clang jangle echoing vault roof tunnel cling other catch hold arm case frighten explain 
160,"And now, slowly and gradually, the tail-lights grew smaller and smaller, and so did the noise, till with one last WHIZ the train got itself out of the tunnel, and silence settled again on its damp walls and dripping roof.",tail light grow small small do noise last train get tunnel silence settle damp wall drip roof

168,"So the three went on into the deeper darkness of the tunnel. Peter led, holding his candle end high to light the way. The grease ran down his fingers, and some of it right up his sleeve. He found a long streak from wrist to elbow when he went to bed that night.",go deep darkness tunnel lead hold candle end high light way grease run finger sleeve find long streak wrist elbow go bed night 
169,"It was not more than a hundred and fifty yards from the spot where they had stood while the train went by that Peter stood still, shouted “Hullo,” and then went on much quicker than before. When the others caught him up, he stopped. And he stopped within a yard of what they had come into the tunnel to look for. Phyllis saw a gleam of red, and shut her eyes tight. There, by the curved, pebbly down line, was the red-jerseyed hound. His back was against the wall, his arms hung limply by his sides, and his eyes were shut.",more yard spot stand train go stand shout go quick other catch stop stop yard come tunnel look see gleam red shut eye tight curved pebbly down line red jersey hound back wall arm hang side eye shut

Bobbie burned the feathers of the shuttlecock one by one under his nose, Phyllis splashed warmish milk on his forehead, and all three kept on saying as fast and as earnestly as they could:--",rub hand red jersey one burn feather shuttlecock nose splash warmish milk forehead keep say
