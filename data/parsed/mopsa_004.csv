2,"  The dove laid some little sticks,     Then began to coo;   The gnat took his trumpet up     To play the day through;   The pie chattered soft and long--     But that she always does;   The bee did all he had to do,     And only said, ""Buzz.""",dove lay little stick begin coo gnat take trumpet play day pie chatter soft long bee do have do say buzz 
3," When Jack at length opened his eyes, he found that it was night, for the full moon was shining; but it was not at all a dark night, for he could see distinctly some black birds, that looked like ravens. They were sitting in a row on the edge of the boat.",length open eye find night full moon shine dark night see black bird look raven sit row edge boat 
4,"Now that he had fairies in his pockets, he could understand bird-talk, and he heard one of these ravens saying, ""There is no meat so tender; I wish I could pick their little eyes out.""",have fairy pocket understand bird talk hear raven say be meat tender wish pick little eye 
5,"""Yes,"" said another, ""fairies are delicate eating indeed. We must speak Jack fair if we want to get at them."" And she heaved up a deep sigh.",say fairy delicate eat speak fair want get heave deep sigh 
6,"Jack lay still, and thought he had better pretend to be asleep; but they soon noticed that his eyes were open, and one of them presently walked up his leg and bowed, and asked if he was hungry.",lay think good pretend asleep notice eye open walk leg bow ask hungry 
7,"Jack said, ""No.""",say 
8,"""No more am I,"" replied the raven; ""not at all hungry."" Then she hopped off his leg, and Jack sat up.",more reply raven hungry hopp leg sit 
9,"""And how are the sweet fairies that my young master is taking to their home?"" asked another of the ravens. ""I hope they are safe in my young master's pockets?""",sweet fairy young master take home ask raven hope safe young master pocket 
10,"Jack felt in his pockets. Yes, they were all safe; but he did not take any of them out, lest the ravens should snatch at them.",feel pocket safe take raven snatch 
11,"""Eh?"" continued the raven, pretending to listen; ""did this dear young gentleman say that the fairies were asleep?""",continue raven pretend listen dear young gentleman say fairy asleep 
12,"""It doesn't amuse me to talk about fairies,"" said Jack; ""but if you would explain some of the things in this country that I cannot make out, I should be very glad.""",amuse talk fairy say explain thing country make glad 
13,"""What things?"" asked the blackest of the ravens.",thing ask blackest raven 
14,"""Why,"" said Jack, ""I see a full moon lying down there among the water-flags, and just going to set, and there is a half-moon overhead plunging among those great gray clouds, and just this moment I saw a thin crescent moon peeping out between the branches of that tree.""",say see full moon lie water flag go set be half moon overhead plung great gray cloud moment see thin crescent moon peep branch tree 
15,"""Well,"" said all the ravens at once, ""did the young master never see a crescent moon in the men and women's world?""",say raven young master see crescent moon man woman world 
16,"""Oh yes,"" said Jack.",say 
17,"""Did he never see a full moon?"" asked the ravens.",see full moon ask raven 
18,"""Yes, of course,"" said Jack; ""but they are the same moon. I could never see all three of them at the same time.""",course say same moon see same time 
19,"The ravens were very much surprised at this, and one of them said,--",raven surprised say 
20,"""If my young master did not see the moons it must have been because he didn't look. Perhaps my young master slept in a room, and had only one window; if so, he couldn't see all the sky at once.""",young master see moon look young master sleep room have window see sky 
21,"""I tell you, Raven,"" said Jack, laughing, ""that I KNOW there is never more than one moon in my country, and sometimes there is no moon at all!""",tell say laugh know be more moon country be moon 
22,"Upon this all the ravens hung down their heads, and looked very much ashamed; for there is nothing that birds hate so much as to be laughed at, and they believed that Jack was saying this to mock them, and that he knew what they had come for. So first one and then another hopped to the other end of the boat and flew away, till at last there was only one left, and she appeared to be out of spirits, and did not speak again till he spoke to her.",raven hang head look ashamed be bird hate much laugh believe say mock know come first one hopp other end boat fly last be left appear spirit speak speak 
23,"""Raven,"" said Jack, ""there's something very cold and slippery lying at the bottom of the boat. I touched it just now, and I don't like it at all.""",say be cold slippery lie bottom boat touch like 
24,"""It's a water-snake,"" said the raven; and she stooped and picked up a long thing with her beak, which she threw out, and then looked over. ""The water swarms with them, wicked, murderous creatures; they smell the young fairies, and they want to eat them.""",water snake say raven stoop pick long thing beak throw look water swarm wicked murderous creature smell young fairy want eat 
25,"Jack was so thrown off his guard that he snatched one fairy out, just to make sure that it was safe. It was the one with the mustache; and, alas! in one instant the raven flew at it, got it out of his hand, and pecked off its head before it had time to wake or Jack to rescue it. Then, as she slowly rose, she croaked, and said to Jack, ""You'll catch it for this, my young master!"" and she flew to the bough of a tree, where she finished eating the fairy, and threw his little empty coat into the river.",throw guard snatch fairy make sure safe one mustache instant raven fly get hand peck head have time wake rescue rise croak say catch young master fly bough tree finish eat fairy throw little empty coat river 
26,"On this Jack began to cry bitterly, and to think what a foolish boy he had been. He was the more sorry because he did not even know that poor little fellow's name. But he had heard the others calling by name to their companions, and very grand names they were too. One was Jovinian,--he was a very fierce-looking gentleman; the other two were Roxaletta and Mopsa.",begin cry think foolish boy sorry know poor little fellow name hear other call name companion grand name fierce look gentleman other 
27,"Presently, however, Jack forgot to be unhappy, for two of the moons went down, and then the sun rose, and he was delighted to find that however many moons there might be, there was only one sun, even in the country of the wonderful river.",forget unhappy moon go sun rise delighted find many moon be sun country wonderful river 
28,"So on and on they went; but the river was very wide, and the waves were boisterous. On the right brink was a thick forest of trees, with such heavy foliage that a little way off they looked like a bank, green, and smooth, and steep; but as the light became clearer, Jack could see here and there the great stems, and see creatures like foxes, wild boars, and deer, come stealing down to drink in the river.",go river wide wave boisterous right brink thick forest tree such heavy foliage little way look bank green smooth steep light become clear see great stem see creature fox wild boar deer come steal drink river 
29,"It was very hot here; not at all like the spring weather he had left behind. And as the low sunbeams shone into Jack's face he said hastily, without thinking of what would occur, ""I wish I might land among those lovely glades on the left bank.""",hot spring weather leave low sunbeam shine face say think occur wish land lovely glade left bank 
30,"No sooner said than the boat began to make for the left bank, and the nearer they got towards it the more beautiful it became; but also the more stormy were the reaches of water they had to traverse.",say boat begin make left bank nearer get beautiful become more stormy reach water have traverse 
31,"A lovely country indeed! It sloped gently down to the water's edge, and beautiful trees were scattered over it, soft, mossy grass grew everywhere, great old laburnum trees stretched their boughs down in patches over the water, and higher up camellias, almost as large as hawthorns, grew together and mingled their red and white flowers.",lovely country slope water edge beautiful tree scatter soft mossy grass grow great old laburnum tree stretch bough patch water high camellias large hawthorn grow mingle red white flower 
32,"The country was not so open as a park,--it was more like a half-cleared woodland; but there was a wide space just where the boat was steering for, that had no trees, only a few flowering shrubs. Here groups of strange-looking people were bustling about, and there were shrill fifes sounding, and drums.",country open park half clear woodland be wide space boat steering have tree few flowering shrub group strange look person bustle be shrill fife sound drum 
33,Farther back he saw rows of booths or tents under the shade of the trees.,see row booth tent shade tree 
34,"In another place some people dressed like gypsies had made fires of sticks just at the skirts of the woodland, and were boiling their pots. Some of these had very gaudy tilted carts, hung all over with goods, such as baskets, brushes, mats, little glasses, pottery, and beads.",place person dress gypsie make fire stick skirt woodland boil pot have gaudy tilt cart hang goods such basket brush mat little glasses pottery bead 
35,"It seemed to be a kind of fair, to which people had gathered from all parts; but there was not one house to be seen. All the goods were either hung upon trees or collected in strange-looking tents.",seem kind fair person gather part be house see goods hang tree collect strange look tent 
36,"The people were not all of the same race; indeed, he thought the only human beings were the gypsies, for the folks who had tents were no taller than himself.",person same race think only human being gypsie folk have tent tall 
37,"How hot it was that morning! and as the boat pushed itself into a little creek, and made its way among the beds of yellow and purple iris which skirted the brink, what a crowd of dragon-flies and large butterflies rose from them!",hot morning boat push little creek make way bed yellow purple iris skirt brink crowd dragon fly large butterfly rise 
38,"""Stay where you are!"" cried Jack to the boat; and at that instant such a splendid moth rose slowly, that he sprang on shore after it, and quite forgot the fair and the people in his desire to follow it.",stay cry boat instant splendid moth rise spring shore forget fair person desire follow 
39,"The moth settled on a great red honey-flower, and he stole up to look at it. As large as a swallow, it floated on before him. Its wings were nearly black, and they had spots of gold on them.",moth settle great red honey flower steal look large swallow float wing black have spot gold 
40,"When it rose again Jack ran after it, till he found himself close to the rows of tents where the brown people stood; and they began to cry out to him, ""What'll you buy? what'll you buy, sir?"" and they crowded about him, so that he soon lost sight of the moth, and forgot everything else in his surprise at the booths.",rise run find close row tent brown person stand begin cry buy buy sir crowd lose sight moth forget else surprise booth 
41,"They were full of splendid things,--clocks and musical boxes, strange china ornaments, embroidered slippers, red caps, and many kinds of splendid silks and small carpets. In other booths were swords and dirks, glittering with jewels; and the chatter of the people when they talked together was not in a language that Jack could understand.",full splendid thing clock musical box strange china ornament embroider slipper red cap many kind splendid silk small carpet other booth sword dirk glitter jewel chatter person talk language understand 
42,"Some of the booths were square, and evidently made of common canvas, for when you went into them, and the sun shone, you could distinctly see the threads.",booth square make common canvas go sun shine see thread 
43,"But scattered a little farther on in groups were some round tents, which were far more curious. They were open on all sides, and consisted only of a thick canopy overhead, which was supported by one beautiful round pillar in the middle.",scatter little group round tent curious open side consist thick canopy support beautiful round pillar middle 
44,"Outside the canopy was white or brownish; but when Jack stood under these tents, he saw that they were lined with splendid flutings of brown or pink silk: what looked like silk, at least, for it was impossible to be sure whether these were real tents or gigantic mushrooms.",canopy white brownish stand tent see line splendid fluting brown pink silk look silk least impossible sure real tent gigantic mushroom 
45,"They varied in size, also, as mushrooms do, and in shape: some were large enough for twenty people to stand under them, and had flat tops with a brown lining; others had dome-shaped roofs; these were lined with pink, and would only shelter six or seven.",vary size mushroom do shape large person stand have flat top brown lining other have dome shape roof line pink shelter 
46,"The people who sold in these tents were as strange as their neighbors; each had a little high cap on his head, in shape just like a beehive, and it was made of straw, and had a little hole in front. In fact, Jack very soon saw bees flying in and out, and it was evident that these people had their honey made on the premises. They were chiefly selling country produce. They had cheeses so large as to reach to their waists, and the women trundled them along as boys do their hoops. They sold a great many kinds of seed, too, in wooden bowls, and cakes and good things to eat, such as gilt gingerbread. Jack bought some of this, and found it very nice indeed. But when he took out his money to pay for it, the little man looked rather strangely at it, and turned it over with an air of disgust. Then Jack saw him hand it to his wife, who also seemed to dislike it; and presently Jack observed that they followed him about, first on one side, then on the other. At last, the little woman slipped her hand into his pocket, and Jack, putting his hand in directly, found his sixpence had been returned.",person sell tent strange neighbor have little high cap head shape beehive make straw have little hole front fact see bee fly evident person have honey make premise sell country produce have cheese large reach waist woman trundle boy do hoop sell great many kind seed wooden bowl cake good thing eat such gilt gingerbread buy find nice take money pay little man look turn air disgust see hand wife seem dislike observe follow side other last little woman slip hand pocket put hand find sixpence return 
47,"""Why, you've given me back my money!"" he said.",give money say 
48,"The little woman put her hands behind her. ""I do not like it,"" she said; ""it's dirty; at least, it's not new.""",little woman put hand like say dirty least new 
49,"""No, it's not new,"" said Jack, a good deal surprised, ""but it is a good sixpence.""",new say good deal surprise good sixpence 
50,"""The bees don't like it,"" continued the little woman. ""They like things to be neat and new, and that sixpence is bent.""",bee like continue little woman like thing neat new sixpence bent 
51,"""What shall I give you then?"" said Jack.",give say 
52,"The good little woman laughed and blushed. ""This young gentleman has a beautiful whistle round his neck,"" she observed, politely, but did not ask for it.",good little woman laugh blush young gentleman have beautiful whistle neck observe ask 
53,"Jack had a dog-whistle, so he took it off and gave it to her.",have dog whistle take give 
54,"""Thank you for the bees,"" she said. ""They love to be called home when we've collected flowers for them.""",thank bee say love call home collect flower 
55,"So she made a pretty little courtesy, and went away to her customers.",make little courtesy go customer 
56,"There were some very strange creatures also, about the same height as Jack, who had no tents, and seemed there to buy, not to sell. Yet they looked poorer than the other folks, and they were also very cross and discontented; nothing pleased them. Their clothes were made of moss, and their mantles of feathers; and they talked in a queer whistling tone of voice, and carried their skinny little children on their backs and on their shoulders.",be strange creature same height have tent seem buy sell look poorer other folk cross discontented pleased clothes make moss mantle feather talk queer whistle tone voice carry skinny little child back shoulder 
57,"They were treated with great respect by the people in the tents; and when Jack asked his friend to whom he had given the whistle what they were, and where they got so much money as they had, she replied that they lived over the hills, and were afraid to come in their best clothes. They were rich and powerful at home, and they came shabbily dressed, and behaved humbly, lest their enemies should envy them. It was very dangerous, she said, to fairies to be envied.",treat great respect person tent ask friend give whistle get much money have reply live hill afraid come good clothes rich powerful home come dress behave enemy envy dangerous say fairy envie 
58,"Jack wanted to listen to their strange whistling talk, but he could not for the noise and cheerful chattering of the brown folks, and more still for the screaming and talking of parrots.",want listen strange whistling talk noise cheerful chattering brown folk scream talking parrot 
59,"Among the goods were hundreds of splendid gilt cages, which were hung by long gold chains from the trees. Each cage contained a parrot and his mate, and they all seemed to be very unhappy indeed.",goods hundred splendid gilt cage hang long gold chain tree cage contain parrot mate seem unhappy 
60,"The parrots could talk, and they kept screaming to the discontented women to buy things for them, and trying very hard to attract attention.",parrot talk keep scream discontented woman buy thing try hard attract attention 
61,"One old parrot made himself quite conspicuous by these efforts. He flung himself against the wires of his cage, he squalled, he screamed, he knocked the floor with his beak, till Jack and one of the customers came running up to see what was the matter.",old parrot make conspicuous effort flung wire cage squall scream knock floor beak customer come run see matter 
62,"""What do you make such a fuss for?"" cried the discontented woman. ""You've set your cage swinging with knocking yourself about; and what good does that do? I cannot break the spell and open it for you.""",make fuss cry discontented woman set cage swing knock good do break spell open 
63,"""I know that,"" answered the parrot, sobbing; ""but it hurts my feelings so that you should take no notice of me now that I have come down in the world.""",know answer parrot sobb hurt feeling take notice come world 
64,"""Yes,"" said the parrot's mate, ""it hurts our feelings.""",say parrot mate hurt feeling 
65,"""I haven't forgotten you,"" answered the woman, more crossly than ever; ""I was buying a measure of maize for you when you began to make such a noise.""",forget answer woman buy measure maize begin make noise 
66,"Jack thought this was the queerest conversation he had ever heard in his life; and he was still more surprised when the bird answered,--",think queerest conversation hear life surprise bird answer 
67,"""I would much rather you would buy me a pocket-handkerchief. Here we are, shut up, without a chance of getting out, and with nobody to pity us; and we can't even have the comfort of crying, because we've got nothing to wipe our eyes with.""",buy pocket handkerchief shut chance get pity have comfort cry get wipe eye

69,"""Buy me a handkerchief,"" sobbed the parrot.",buy handkerchief sobb parrot 
70,"""I can't afford both,"" whined the cross woman, ""and I've paid now for the maize."" So saying, she went back to the tent to fetch her present to the parrots; and as their cage was still swinging Jack put out his hand to steady it for them, and the instant he did so they became perfectly silent, and all the other parrots on that tree, who had been flinging themselves about in their cages, left off screaming, and became silent too.",afford whine cross woman pay maize say go tent fetch present parrot cage swing put hand steady instant become silent other parrot tree fling cage leave scream become silent 
71,"The old parrot looked very cunning. His cage hung by such a long gold chain that it was just on a level with Jack's face, and so many odd things had happened that day that it did not seem more odd than usual to hear him say, in a tone of great astonishment,--",old parrot look cunning cage hang long gold chain level face many odd thing happen day seem odd usual hear say tone great astonishment

77,"Jack did not know how this could have told him, so he only answered, ""Indeed!""",know tell answer 
78,"""I'm a fairy,"" observed the parrot, in a confidential tone. ""We are imprisoned here by our enemies the gypsies.""",fairy observe parrot confidential tone imprison enemy gypsie 
79,"""So we are,"" answered a chorus of other parrots.",answer chorus other parrot 
80,"""I'm sorry for that,"" replied Jack. ""I'm friends with the fairies.""",sorry reply friend fairy 
81,"""Don't tell,"" said the parrot, drawing a film over his eyes, and pretending to be asleep. At that moment his friend in the moss petticoat and feather cloak came up with a little measure of maize, and poured it into the cage.",tell say parrot draw film eye pretend asleep moment friend moss petticoat feather cloak come little measure maize pour cage 
82,"""Here, neighbor,"" she said; ""I must say good-by now, for the gypsy is coming this way, and I want to buy some of her goods.""",neighbor say say good gypsy come way want buy goods

84,"""I'll lend you my handkerchief,"" said Jack. ""Here!"" And he drew it out, and pushed it between the wires.",lend handkerchief say draw push wire
