1,CHAPTER 64.,
2,"The second day was passed in keeping a look-out upon the savages, and awaiting a fresh attack.  They could perceive from the top of the cocoa-nut tree that the savages held a council of war in the forenoon, sitting round in a large circle, while one got up in the centre and made a speech, flourishing his club and spear while he spoke.  In the afternoon the council broke up, and the savages were observed to be very busy in all directions, cutting down the cocoa-nut trees, and collecting all the brushwood.",second day pass keep look savage await fresh attack perceive top cocoa nut tree savage hold council war forenoon sit large circle get centre make speech flourish club spear speak afternoon council break savage observe busy direction cut cocoa nut tree collect brushwood 
3,"Ready watched them for a long while, and at last came down a little before sunset.  ""Mr Seagrave,"" said he, ""we shall have, in my opinion, no attack this night, but to-morrow we must expect something very serious; the savages are cutting down the trees, and making large faggots; they do not get on very fast, because their hatchets are made of stone and don't cut very well, but perseverance and numbers will effect everything, and I dare say that they will work all night till they have obtained as many faggots as they want.""",ready watch long while last come little sunset say have opinion attack night expect serious savage cut tree make large faggot get hatchet make stone cut perseverance number effect say work night obtain many faggot want 
4,"""But what do you imagine to be their object, Ready, in cutting down trees, and making the faggots?""",imagine object ready cut tree make faggot 
5,"""Either, sir, to pile them up outside the palisades, so large as to be able to walk up upon them, or else to pile them up to set fire to them, and burn us out.""",sir pile palisadd large able walk else pile set fire burn 
6,"""Do you think they will succeed?""",think succeed 
7,"""Not without very heavy loss; perhaps we may best them off, but it will be a hard fight; harder than any we have had yet.  We must have the women to load the muskets, so that we may fire as fast as we can.  I should not think much of their attempt to burn us, if it were not for the smoke.  Cocoa-nut wood, especially with the bark on, as our palisades have, will char a long while, but not burn easily when standing upright; and the fire, when the faggots are kindled, although it will be fierce, will not last long.""",heavy loss good hard fight hard have have woman load musket fire think much attempt burn smoke cocoa nut wood bark palisadd have char long while burn stand fire faggot kindle fierce last 
8,"""But suffering as we are now, Ready, for want of water, how can we possibly keep up our strength to meet them in a suffocating smoke and flame? we must drop with sheer exhaustion.""",suffering ready want water keep strength meet suffocate smoke flame drop sheer exhaustion 
9,"""We must hope for the best, and do our best, Mr Seagrave,"" replied Ready; ""and recollect that should anything happen to me during the conflict, and if there is any chance of your being overpowered, you must take advantage of the smoke to escape into the woods, and find your way to the tents.  I have no doubt that you will be able to do that; of course the attack will be to windward if they use fire, and you must try and escape to leeward; I have shown William how to force a palisade if necessary.  The savages, if they get possession, will not think of looking for you at first, and, perhaps, when they have obtained all that the house contains, not even afterwards.""",hope good do good reply ready recollect happen conflict be chance overpower take advantage smoke escape wood find way tent have doubt able do course attack windward use fire try escape leeward show force palisade necessary savage get possession think look first obtain house contain 
10,"""Why do you say if any accident happens to you, Ready?"" said William.",say accident happen ready say 
11,"""Because, William, if they place the faggots so as to be able to walk to the top of the palisades, I may be wounded or killed, and so may you.""",place faggot able walk top palisadd wound kill 
12,"""Of course,"" replied William; ""but they are not in yet, and they shall have a hard fight for it.""",course reply have hard fight 
13,"Ready then told Mr Seagrave that he would keep the watch, and call him at twelve o'clock.  During these two days, they had eaten very little; a turtle had been killed, and pieces fried, but eating only added to their thirst, and even the children refused the meat.  The sufferings were now really dreadful, and poor Mrs Seagrave was almost frantic.",ready tell keep watch call o'clock day eat little turtle kill piece fry eat add thirst child refuse meat suffering dreadful poor frantic 
14,"As soon as Mr Seagrave had gone into the house, Ready called William, and said, ""William, water we must have.  I cannot bear to see the agony of the poor children, and the state of mind which your poor mother is in; and more, without water we never shall be able to beat off the savages to-morrow.  We shall literally die of choking in the smoke, if they use fire.  Now, William, I intend to take one of the seven-gallon barricos, and go down to the well for water.  I may succeed, and I may not, but attempt it I must, and if I fall it cannot be helped.""",go house ready call say water have bear see agony poor child state mind poor mother more water able beat savage die choke smoke use fire intend take gallon barrico go water succeed attempt fall help 
15,"""Why not let me go, Ready?"" replied William.",let go ready reply 
16,"""For many reasons, William,"" said Ready; ""and the chief one is that I do not think you would succeed so well as I shall.  I shall put on the war-cloak and feathers of the savage who fell dead inside of the stockade, and that will be a disguise, but I shall take no arms except his spear, as they would only be in my way, and increase the weight I have to carry.  Now observe, you must let me out of the door, and when I am out, in case of accident put one of the poles across it inside; that will keep the door fast, if they attack it, until you can secure it with the others.  Watch my return, and be all ready to let me in.  Do you understand me?""",many reason say ready chief one think succeed put war cloak feather savage fall dead stockade disguise take arm spear way increase weight have carry observe let door case accident put pole keep door attack secure other watch return ready let understand 
17,"""Yes, perfectly, Ready; but I am now, I must confess, really frightened; if anything was to happen to you, what a misery it would be!""",ready confess frighten happen misery 
18,"""There is no help for it, William.  Water must, if possible, be procured, and now is a better time to make the attempt than later, when they may be more on the watch; they have left off their work, and are busy eating; if I meet any one, it will only be a woman.""",be help water possible procure good time make attempt watch leave work busy eat meet one woman 
19,"Ready went for the barrico, a little cask, which held six or seven gallons of water.  He put on the head-dress and war-cloak of the savage; and, taking the barrico on his shoulder, and the spear in his hand, the poles which barred the door were softly removed by William, and after ascertaining that no one was concealed beneath the palisades, Ready pressed William's hand, and set off across the cleared space outside of the stockade, and gained the cocoa-nut trees.  William, as directed, closed the door, passed one pole through the inner door-posts for security, and remained on the watch.  He was in an awful state of suspense, listening to the slightest noise, even the slight rustling by the wind of the cocoa-nut boughs above him made him start; there he continued for some minutes, his gun ready cocked by his side.",ready go barrico little cask hold gallon water put head dress war cloak savage take barrico shoulder spear hand pole barr door remove ascertain conceal palisadd ready press hand set clear space stockade gain cocoa nut tree direct close door pass pole inner door post security remain watch awful state suspense listen slight noise slight rustling wind cocoa nut bough make start continue minute gun ready cocked side 
20,"It is time that he returned, thought William; the distance is not 100 yards, and yet I have heard no noise.  At last he thought he heard footsteps coming very softly.  Yes, it was so.  Ready was returning, and without any accident.  William had his hand upon the pole, to slip it on one side and open the door, when he heard a scuffle and a fall close to the door.  He immediately threw down the pole, and opened it just as Ready called him by name.  William seized his musket and sprang out; he found Ready struggling with a savage, who was uppermost, and with his spear at Ready's breast.  In a second William levelled and fired, and the savage fell dead.",time return think distance yard hear noise last think hear footstep come ready return accident have hand pole slip side open door hear scuffle fall close door throw pole open ready call name seize musket spring find ready struggle savage uppermost spear breast second levell fire savage fall dead 
21,"""Take the water in quick, William,"" said Ready in a faint voice.  ""I will contrive to crawl in if I can.""",take water quick say ready faint voice contrive crawl 
22,"William caught up the barrico of water, and took it in; he then hastened to Ready, who was on his knees.  Mr Seagrave, hearing the musket fired, had run out, and finding the stockade door open, followed William, and seeing him endeavouring to support Ready, caught hold of his other arm, and they led him tottering into the stockade; the door was then immediately secured, and they went to his assistance.",catch barrico water take hasten ready knee hear musket fire run find stockade door open follow see endeavour support ready catch hold other arm lead totter stockade door secure go assistance 
23,"""Are you hurt, Ready?"" said William.",hurt ready say 
24,"""Yes, dear boy, yes; hurt to death, I fear: his spear went through my breast.  Water, quick, water!""",dear boy hurt death fear spear go breast water quick water 
25,"""Alas! that we had some,"" said Mr Seagrave.",have say 
26,"""We have, papa,"" replied William; ""but it has cost us dearly.""",have papa reply cost 
27,"William ran for a pannikin, and taking out the bung, poured some water out of the barrico and gave it to Ready, who drank it with eagerness.",run pannikin take bung pour water barrico give ready drink eagerness 
28,"""Now, William, lay me down on these cocoa-nut boughs; go and give some water to the others, and when you have all drunk, then come to me again. Don't tell Mrs Seagrave that I'm hurt.  Do as I beg of you.""",lay cocoa nut bough go give water other drunk come tell hurt beg 
29,"""Papa, take the water--do pray,"" replied William; ""I cannot leave Ready.""",take water pray reply leave ready 
30,"""I will, my boy,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""but first drink yourself.""",boy reply drink 
31,"William, who was very faint, drank off the pannikin of water, which immediately revived him, and then, while Mr Seagrave hastened with some water to the children and women, occupied himself with old Ready, who breathed heavily, but did not speak.",faint drink pannikin water revive hasten water child woman occupy old ready breathe speak
