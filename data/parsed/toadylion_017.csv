1,CHAPTER XVII. BEFORE THE INQUISITION.,inquisition 
2," With this excursion into the natural history of the Smoutchy Boy, which perhaps ought to have come somewhat earlier in the history, we continue the tale of the adventures of General Napoleon Smith.",excursion natural history come history continue tale adventure 
3,"Beaten down by numbers, the hero lay on the ground at the corner of the butcher's parks. Nipper Donnan stood over him and held him down with his foot. They were just the right ages for bully and bullied. Hugh John Smith was twelve, slim, and straight as an arrow; Nipper Donnan sixteen, short, hard, and thick set, with large solid hands and prominent knuckles.",beaten number hero lay ground corner butcher park stand hold foot right age bully bull slim straight arrow short hard thick set large solid hand prominent knuckle 
4,"""Got you at last, young prig! Now I'll do you to rights!"" remarked Nipper, genially kicking Hugh John in the ribs with his hobnailed boots.",get last young prig do right remark kick rib hobnailed boot 
5,"Hugh John said not a word, for he had fought till there was no more breath left in him anywhere.",say word fight be more breath leave 
6,"""Sulky, hey?"" said Nipper, with another kick in a more tender spot. Hugh John winced. ""Ah, lads, I thought that would wake the young swell up. Oh, our father is the owner of this property, is he? So nice! He owns the town, does he? Nasty pauper he is! Too poor to keep a proper carriage, but thinks us all dirt under his feet. Yaw, yaw, we aw-w so fine, we aw-w, we a-aw!""",say kick tender spot wince lad think wake young swell father owner property nice own town nasty pauper poor keep proper carriage think dirt foot be fine 
7,"And Nipper Donnan imitated, amid the mean obsequious laughter of his fighting tail, the erect carriage of his father's enemy, Mr. Picton Smith, as he was accustomed to stride somewhat haughtily down the High Street of Edam.",imitate mean obsequious laughter fighting tail erect carriage father enemy accustom stride high 
8,Then he came back and kicked Hugh John again.,come kick 
9,"""You wouldn't dare to do this if my father were here!"" said General Napoleon, now sitting up on his elbow.",dare do father say sit elbow 
10,"""_Your_ father, I'll show you!"" shouted furiously Nipper the Tyrant. ""Who asked you to come here anyway to meddle with us? Who invited you into our parks? What business have you in our castle? Fetch him along, boys; we'll show him something that neither he nor his father know anything about. They and the likes of them used to shut up people in the castle dungeons, so they say. We are just the boys to give 'em a taste of what it is like theirselves.""",father show shout ask come meddle invite park business castle fetch boy show father know like use shut person castle dungeon say boy give e taste 
11,"""Hooray,"" shouted the Smoutchy fighting tail; ""fetch him along, lads!""",shout fighting tail fetch lad 
12,"So with no gentle hands Hugh John was seized and hurried away. He was touched up with ironbound clogs in the rear, his arms were pinched underneath where the skin is tender, as well as nearly dragged from their sockets. A useless red cravat was thrust into his mouth by way of a gag--useless, for the prisoner would sooner have died than have uttered one solitary cry.",gentle hand seize hurry touch ironbound clog rear arm pinch skin tender drag socket useless red cravat thrust mouth way gag useless prisoner die utter solitary cry 
13,And all the time Hugh John was saying over and over to himself the confession of his faith:,time say confession faith 
14,"""I'm glad I didn't tell--I'm glad I wasn't 'dasht-mean.' I'm a soldier. The Scots Greys saluted me; and these fellows _shan't_ make me cry.""",glad tell glad dasht mean soldier salute fellow make cry 
15,"And they didn't. For the spirit of many generations of stalwart Smiths and fighting Pictons was in him, and perhaps also a spark from the ancestral anvil of the first Smith had put iron into his boyish blood. So all through the scene which followed--the slow mock trial, the small ingenious tortures, pulling back middle fingers, hanging up by thumbs to a beam with his toes just touching the ground, tying a string about his head and tightening it with a twisted stick--Hugh John never cried a tear, which was the bitterest drop in the cup of Nipper Donnan.",spirit many generation stalwart fighting spark ancestral anvil first put iron boyish blood scene follow slow mock trial small ingenious torture pull middle finger hang thumb beam toe touch ground tie string head tighten twist stick cry tear bitterest drop cup 
16,They removed the gag in order that they might question him.,remove gag order question 
17,"""Say this is not your father's castle, and we'll let you down!"" cried Nipper.",say father castle let cry 
18,"""It _is_ my father's and nobody else's! And when it is mine, I shan't let one of you beasts come near it.""",father else let beast come 
19,The Smoutchies tried another tack.,try tack 
20,"""Promise you won't tell on us if we let you go!""",promise tell let go 
21,"""I shan't promise; I will tell every one of your names to the policeman, and get you put in jail--so there! My father has gone to London to see the Queen, and have you all put into prison--yes, and whipped with a cat-o'-nine-tails as soon as ever he comes back!"" answered Hugh John, shamelessly belying both his father and his own intentions.",promise tell one name policeman get put jail father go see put prison whip cat o' tail come answer bely father own intention 
22,"But he comforted himself and excused the lie, by saying to himself, ""It is none of their business whether I tell on them or not. They shan't think that I don't tell because I am afraid of them!""",comfort excuse lie say business tell think tell afraid 
23,And the great heart of the hero (aged twelve) stood high and unshaken.,great heart hero aged stand high unshaken 
24,"At last even Nipper Donnan tired of the cruel sport. It was no great fun when the victim could not be made to cry or appeal for mercy. And even the fighting tail grew vaguely restive, perhaps becoming indistinctly conscious, in spite of their blind admiration for their chief, that by comparison with the steadfast defiance and upright mien of their solitary victim, the slouching, black-pipe-smoking smoutchiness of Nipper Donnan did not appear the truly heroic figure.",last tired cruel sport great fun victim make cry appeal mercy fighting tail grow restive become conscious spite blind admiration chief comparison steadfast defiance upright mien solitary victim slouching black pipe smoking smoutchiness appear heroic figure 
25,"""Let's put him in the dungeon, and leave him there! I can come and let him out after, and then kick the beggar home the way he came! That will learn him to let us alone for ever and ever!""",let put dungeon leave come let kick beggar way come learn let 
26,"The fighting tail shouted agreement, and Hugh John was promptly haled to the mouth of the prison-house; a rope was rove about his waist, his hands were tied behind his back, and he was lowered down into the ancient dungeon of the Castle of Windy Standard. This place of confinement had last been used a hundred and fifty years ago for the stragglers of the Bonny Prince's army after the retreat northward. The dungeon was bottle-necked above, and spread out beneath into a circular vault of thirty or forty feet in diameter. Its depth was about twelve feet; and as the boys had not rope enough to lower their prisoner all the way, they had perforce to let Hugh John drop, and he lighted on his feet, taking of course the rope with him.",fighting tail shout agreement hale mouth prison house rope rove waist hand tie back lower ancient dungeon windy place confinement use year straggler army retreat dungeon bottle neck spread circular vault foot diameter depth foot boy rope lower prisoner way have perforce let drop light foot take course rope 
27,"""Come on, lads,"" cried Nipper Donnan, ""let's go and have a smoke at the Black Sheds, and then go up to the Market Hill to see the shows. The proud swine will do well enough down there till his father comes back from London with the cat-o'-nine-tails!""",come lad cry let go have smoke black go see show proud swine do father come cat tail 
28,He looked over the edge and spat into the dungeon.,look edge spat dungeon 
29,"""That for you!"" he cried. ""Will ye say now that the castle is your father's, and that we have no right here!""",cry say castle father have right 
30,"Hugh John tried to give the required information as to ownership, but it was choked in the folds of the red cravat. Nipper went on tauntingly, all unchallenged.",try give require information ownership choke fold red cravat go unchallenged 
31,"[""'WILL YE SAY NOW THAT THE CASTLE IS YOUR FATHER'S, AND THAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT HERE!' SAID NIPPER DONNAN.""]",say castle father have say 
32,"""There's ethers (adders) down there--and weasels and whopper rats that eat off your fingers and toes. Yes, and my father saw a black beast like an otter, but as big as a calf, run in there out of the Edam Water; and they'll bite ye and stang ye and suck your blood! And we are never coming back no more, so ye'll die of starvation besides.""",be ether adder weasel whopper rat eat finger toe father see black beast otter big calf run bite stang suck blood come die starvation 
33,"With this pleasing speech by way of farewell and benediction, Nipper Donnan drew off his forces, and Hugh John was left alone.",pleasing speech way farewell benediction draw force leave alone
