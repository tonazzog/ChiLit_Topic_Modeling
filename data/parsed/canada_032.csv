1,CHAPTER XXXII.,
2," As Henry had predicted, during the autumn the whole family were fully employed. The stock had increased very much, they had a large number of young calves and heifers, and the sheep had lambed down very favorably. Many of the stock were now turned into the bush, to save the feed on the prairies. The sheep with their lambs, the cows which were in milk, and the young calves only were retained. This gave them more leisure to attend to the corn harvest, which was now ready, and it required all their united exertions from daylight to sunset to get it in, for they had a very large quantity of ground to clear. It was, however, got in very successfully, and all stacked in good order. Then came the thrashing of the wheat, which gave them ample employment; and as soon as it could be thrashed out, it was taken to the mill in a wagon, and ground down, for Mr. Campbell had engaged to supply a certain quantity of flour to the fort before the winter set in. They occasionally received a visit from Captain Sinclair and the Colonel, and some other officers, for now they had gradually become intimate with many of them. Captain Sinclair had confided to the Colonel his engagement to Mary Percival, and in consequence the Colonel allowed him to visit at the farm as often as he could, consistently with his duty. The other officers who came to see them, perceiving how much Captain Sinclair engrossed the company of Mary Percival, were very assiduous in their attentions to Emma, who laughed with and at them, and generally contrived to give them something to do for her during their visit, as well as to render their attentions serviceable to the household. On condition that Emma accompanied them, they were content to go into the punt and fish for hours; and indeed, all the lake-fish which were caught this year were taken by the officers. There were several very pleasant young men among them and they were always well received, as they added very much to the society at the farm.",predict autumn whole family employ stock increase have large number young calve heifer sheep lamb many stock turn bush save feed prairy sheep lamb cow milk young calve retain give more leisure attend corn harvest ready require united exertion daylight sunset get have large quantity ground clear get stack good order come thrashing wheat give ample employment thrash take mill wagon ground engage supply certain quantity flour fort winter set receive visit other officer become intimate many confide engagement consequence allow visit farm duty other officer come see perceive much engross company assiduous attention laugh contrive give do visit render attention serviceable household condition accompany content go punt fish hour lake fish catch year take officer be several pleasant young man receive add society farm 
3,"Before the winter set in the flour was all ready, and sent to the fort, as were the cattle which the Colonel requested, and it was very evident that the Colonel was right when he said that the arrangement would be advantageous to both parties. Mr. Campbell, instead of drawing money to pay, this year for the first time received a bill on the government to a considerable amount for the flour and cattle furnished to the troops; and Mrs. Campbell's account for fowls, pork, etc., furnished to the garrison, was by no means to be despised. Thus, by the kindness of others, his own exertions, and a judicious employment of his small capital, Mr. Campbell promised to be in a few years a wealthy and independent man. As soon as the harvest was in, Malachi and John, who were of no use in thrashing out the corn, renewed their hunting expeditions, and seldom returned without venison. The Indians had not been seen by Malachi during his excursions, nor any trace of their having been in the neighborhood; all alarm, therefore, on that account was now over, and the family prepared to meet the coming winter with all the additional precautions which the foregoing had advised them of. But during the Indian summer they received letters from England, detailing, as usual, the news relative to friends with whom they had been intimate; also one from Quebec, informing Mr. Campbell that his application for the extra grant of land was consented to; and another from Montreal, from Mr. Emmerson, stating that he had offered terms to two families of settlers who bore very good characters, and if they were accepted by Mr. Campbell, the parties would join them at the commencement of the ensuing spring.",winter set flour ready send fort cattle request evident right say arrangement advantageous party draw money pay year first time receive bill government considerable amount flour cattle furnish troops account fowl pork etc. furnish garrison means despise kindness other own exertion judicious employment small capital promise few year wealthy independent man harvest use thrash corn renew hunting expedition return venison see excursion trace neighborhood alarm account family prepare meet come winter additional precaution foregoing advise indian summer receive letter detail usual news relative friend intimate inform application extra grant land consent state offer term family settler bear good character accept party join commencement ensue spring 
4,"This was highly gratifying to Mr. Campbell, and as the terms were, with a slight variation, such as he had proposed, he immediately wrote to Mr. Emmerson, agreeing to terms, and requesting that the bargain might be concluded. At the same time that the Colonel forwarded the above letters, he wrote to Mr. Campbell to say that the interior of the fort required a large quantity of plank for repairs, that he was authorized to take them from Mr. Campbell, at a certain price, if he could afford to supply them on these terms, and have them ready by the following spring. This was another act of kindness on the part of the Colonel, as it would now give employment to the saw-mill for the winter, and it was during the winter, and at the time that the snow was on the ground, that they could easily drag the timber after it was felled to the saw-mill. Mr. Campbell wrote an answer, thanking the Colonel for his offer, which he accepted, and promised to have the planks ready by the time the lake was again open.",gratifying term slight variation such propose write agree term request bargain conclude same time forward above letter write say interior fort require large quantity plank repair authorize take certain price afford supply term have ready follow spring act kindness part give employment saw mill winter winter time snow ground drag timber fell saw mill write answer thank offer accept promise have plank ready time lake open 
5,"At last the winter set in, with its usual fall of snow. Captain Sinclair took his leave for a long time, much to the sorrow of all the family, who were warmly attached to him. It was arranged that the only parties who were to go on the hunting excursions should be Malachi and John, as Henry had ample employment in the barns; and Martin and Alfred, in felling timber, and dragging up the stems to the saw-mill, would, with attending to the mill as well, have their whole time taken up. Such were the arrangements out of doors, and now that they had lost the services of poor Percival, and the duties to attend to in doors were so much increased, Mrs. Campbell and the girls were obliged to call in the assistance of Mr. Campbell whenever he could be spared from the garden, which was his usual occupation. Thus glided on the third winter in quiet and security; but in full employment, and with so much to do and attend to, that it passed very rapidly.",last winter set usual fall snow take leave long time much sorrow family attach arrange only party go hunting excursion have ample employment barn fell timber drag stem saw mill attend mill have whole time take such arrangement door lose service poor duty attend door increase girl oblige call assistance spare garden usual occupation glide third winter quiet security full employment much do attend pass 
6,"It was in the month of February, when the snow was very heavy on the ground, that one day Malachi went up to the mill to Alfred, whom he found alone attending the saws, which were in full activity; for Martin was squaring out the timber ready to be sawed at about one hundred yards' distance.",month snow heavy ground day go mill find attend saw full activity squar timber ready saw yard distance

28,"""Well, sir, then that is to say that it is one hundred and eighty miles off, or thereabouts. Now, the first figure is a chief, for it has an eagle's feather on the head of it, and the snake before it is his _totem_, 'the Angry Snake,' and the other six are the number of the band; and you observe, that the chief and the first figure of the six have a gun in their hands, which is to inform us that they have only two rifles among them.""",sir say mile first figure chief have eagle feather head snake angry other number band observe chief first figure have gun hand inform have rifle

34,"""There is no doubt of it, sir,"" replied Malachi; ""and now I will put the whole letter together. Your brother Percival has been carried off by the Angry Snake and his band, and has been taken to some place one hundred and eighty miles to the westward, and this information comes from the Indian woman who belongs to the band, and whose life was preserved by your kindness.

We have the information that the boy is alive, at least it is presumed so; but of course the Indians do not know that we have received such information; if they did, the woman would be killed immediately. Now, sir, the first question we must ask ourselves is, why they have carried off the boy; for it would be no use carrying off a little boy in that manner without some object.""",sir present event have information boy alive least presume course know receive such information woman kill sir first question ask carry boy use carry little boy manner object 
39,"""It is the very question that _I_ was going to put to you, Malachi.""",very question go put 
40,"""Then, sir, I'll answer it to the best of my knowledge and belief. It is this: the Angry Snake came to the settlement, and saw our stores of powder and shot, and every thing else. He would have attacked us last winter if he had found an opportunity and a chance of success. One of his band was killed, which taught him that we were on the watch, and he failed in that attempt: he managed, however, to pick up the boy when he was lagging behind us, at the time you were wounded by the painter, and carried him off, and he intends to drive a bargain for his being restored to us. That is my conviction.""",sir answer good knowledge belief angry come settlement see store powder shot thing else attack last winter find opportunity chance success band kill teach watch fail attempt manage pick boy lagg time wound painter carry intend drive bargain restore conviction

47,"""Well; but, Malachi, are we to let this be known to any body, or keep it a secret?""",let know body keep secret 
48,"""Well, sir, I've thought of that; we must only let Martin and Strawberry into the secret; and I would tell them, because they are almost Indians, as it were; they may have some one coming to them, and there's no fear of their telling. Martin knows better, and as for the Strawberry, she is as safe as if she didn't know it.""",sir think let secret tell have one come be fear telling know good safe know

50,"""Yes, sir, and all the family too, I have no doubt, for the first hour or two after you had told them; but what pain it would give them for months afterward. 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,' as my father used to read out of the Bible, and that's the truth, sir. Only consider how your father, and particularly your mother, would fret and pine during the whole time, and what a state of anxiety they would be in; they would not eat or sleep. No, no, sir; it would be a cruelty to tell them, and it must not be. Nothing can be done till the spring, at all events, and we must wait till the messenger comes to us.""",sir family have doubt first hour tell pain give month hope deferre maketh heart sick father use read truth sir consider father mother fret pine whole time state anxiety eat sleep sir cruelty tell do spring event wait messenger come

52,"""It's a great point our knowing whereabouts the boy is,"" observed Malachi; ""for if it is necessary to make a party to go for him, we know what direction to go in. And it is also a great point to know the strength of the enemy, as now we shall know what force we must take with us in case it is necessary to recover the lad by force or stratagem. All this we gained from the letter, and shall not learn from any messenger sent to us by the Angry Snake, whose head I hope to bruise before I've done with him.""",great point know whereabouts boy observe necessary make party go know direction go great point know strength enemy know force take case necessary recover lad force stratage gain letter learn messenger send angry head hope bruise do

The winter passed away without interruption of any kind. Before the snow had disappeared the seed was all prepared ready for sowing; the planks had been sawed out, and all the wheat not required for seed had been ground down and put into flour-barrels, ready for any further demand from the fort. And thus terminated the third winter in Canada.",conversation finish possess secret allow slight hint drop knowledge winter pass interruption kind snow disappear seed prepare ready sow plank saw wheat require seed ground put flour barrel ready further demand fort terminate third winter
