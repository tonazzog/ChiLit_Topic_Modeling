1,CHAPTER IX. THE GATE OF DEATH.,chapter gate death 
2," Daniel had a good way to go, for the minister’s house was in an opposite direction to his own from the chapel. The November fogs still hung about London, and the lamps gave only a dim light through the gloom. Those who were yet walking about the streets marched quickly, as if anxious to reach whatever shelter they called their own.",have good way go minister house opposite direction own chapel fog hang lamp give dim light gloom walk street march anxious reach shelter call own 
3,"Daniel himself was making his way as fast as he could along the muddy pavement, when he came to a part of the streets where the drainage was being repaired, and where charcoal fires were burning in braziers here and there, at once to give warning to the passers-by and to afford warmth to the watchmen who stayed beside them all night. One of the watchmen had brought an old door and reared it up against a rude wall of stone and bricks so as to form some protection from the rain, which now and then fell in short showers.",make way muddy pavement come part street drainage repair charcoal fire burn brazier give warning passer afford warmth watchmen stay night watchmen bring old door rear rude wall stone brick form protection rain fall short shower 
4,"He had quitted his shed, for some reason or other, and as Daniel drew near his steps were arrested; for crouching underneath it, and stretching out her shrivelled arms over the brazier full of charcoal, was Jessica’s mother. The fitful light was shining strongly upon her face, and showed the deep lines which misery and degradation had ploughed upon it and the sullenness and stupidity which were stamped upon her features.",quit shed reason other draw step arrest crouch stretch shrivell arm brazier full charcoal mother fitful light shine face show deep line misery degradation plough sullenness stupidity stamp feature 
5,"He stood still, gazing at her with disgust; but very soon a feeling of profound pity took its place. He had been wondering what had become of her since Friday morning, and had even felt a kind of anxiety about her; and now, as he thought of the room with its comfortable bed which was waiting for her, instead of the brief shelter of the shed, he climbed over the heaps of rubbish which lay between them, calling to her, for he did not know her name, “Jessica’s mother!”",stand gaze disgust feeling profound pity take place wonder become morning feel kind anxiety think room comfortable bed wait brief shelter shed climb heap rubbish lay call know name mother 
6,"The woman started to her feet at the sound of his voice, and looked him full in the face with an expression of utter wretchedness. Her eyes were inflamed and swollen with tears, and every feature was quivering as if she had no control over them. She was so miserable a creature that Daniel did not know in what words to speak to her; but his heart was moved with an unutterable compassion, unknown to him till now.",woman start foot sound voice look full face expression utter wretchedness eye inflame swollen tear feature quiver have control miserable creature know word speak heart move unutterable compassion unknown 
7,"He even felt a sympathy for her, as if he had once been in the same depths of degradation, as he looked down shudderingly into the deep abyss where she had fallen by her sins; and the sense of her misery touched him so closely that he would have given his life for her salvation. He stretched out his hand towards her, but she pushed it away, and with a groan of despair she fled from the light, and sought to hide herself in the darkness of the foggy streets.",feel sympathy same depth degradation look deep abyss fall sin sense misery touch give life salvation stretch hand push groan despair flead light seek hide darkness foggy street 
8,"But Daniel was not easily turned aside from his desire to bring some help to Jessica’s mother, even if it were no more than to rescue her from the chilliness of the November night. He followed her with steps as rapid as her own, and only that she had the first start he would have been quickly at her side. She fled swiftly along the streets to escape from him, and he pursued her, hoping that she would soon weary and would turn to speak to him.",turn desire bring help mother more rescue chilliness night follow step rapid own have first start side flead street escape pursue hope weary turn speak 
9,"But she kept on until Daniel found himself at the entrance of one of the old bridges of the city which span the wide waters of the river. Side by side with it a new bridge was being constructed with massive beams of timber, and huge blocks of stone, and vast girders of iron, lying like some giant skeleton enveloped in the fog, yet showing dimly through it by the glare of red lights and blazing torches, which were kindled here and there, and cast flickering gleams upon the black waters beneath, into which Daniel looked down with a shiver, as he paused for a moment in his pursuit.",keep find entrance old bridge city span wide water river side side new bridge construct massive beam timber huge block stone vast girder iron lie giant skeleton envelop fog show glare red light blaze torche kindle cast flicker gleam black water look shiver pause moment pursuit 
10,"But he had lost sight of the woman when he lifted up his eyes again, unless the strange dark figure on one of the great beams stretching over the river was the form of Jessica’s mother. He pressed towards it, quitting the safety of the old bridge; but, as a wild and very mournful cry smote upon his ear, he missed his footing, and fell heavily upon a pile of masonry at some distance below him.",lose sight woman lift eye strange dark figure great beam stretch river form mother press quit safety old bridge wild mournful cry smeat ear miss footing fall pile masonry distance 
11,"It could only have been a minute that he was unconscious, for the deep-toned clock of St. Paul’s had chimed the first stroke of midnight as he lost footing, and the boom of the last stroke was still ringing through the air when he tried to raise himself and look again for the dark figure which he had seen hanging over the river; but he could not move, and he lay quietly, without making a second effort, and thinking clearly over what had happened.",minute unconscious deep tone clock chime first stroke midnight lose footing boom last stroke ring air try raise look dark figure see hang river move lay make second effort think happen 
12,"There was little doubt that the wretched woman whom he had sought to save had hurried away from all salvation, whether of God or man; and yet how was it that, instead of the shock of horror, a perfect peace possessed his soul? For a moment it seemed to him that he could hear a voice speaking, through the dull and monotonous splashing of the cold water against the arches below him, and it said to him, “Because thou hast been faithful unto death, I will give thee a crown of life.”",be little doubt wretched woman seek save hurry salvation man shock horror perfect peace possess soul moment seem hear voice speak dull monotonous splashing cold water arche say faithful death give crown life 
13,"Was he going to die? he asked himself, as a pang of extreme agony ran through all his frame, and extorted a moan from his lips. He was ready and willing, if it was the will of God; but he would like to see his little Jessica again and tell her gently with his own lips that her mother was dead, and gone--he could say nothing gentler--to her own place, which God knew of.",go die ask pang extreme agony run frame extort moan lip ready willing will like see little tell own lip mother dead gone say gentler own place know 
14,"The midnight hour was quieter than usual in the busy city, for it was Sunday and the night was damp; so Daniel lay for some time before he heard the tread of a passer-by upon the bridge above him. He could hear many sounds at a little distance; but he could not raise his voice loudly enough to be audible through the splash of the waters. But as soon as he heard footsteps on the bridge he cried, with a strong effort, “Help me, or I shall die before morning!”",midnight hour quiet usual busy city night damp lay time hear tread passer bridge hear many sound little distance raise voice audible splash water hear footstep bridge cry strong effort help die morning 
15,"It seemed a long time, and one of great suffering to him, before he was raised up and laid upon the smooth pathway of the bridge. But he did not cry out or groan; and as the little crowd which gathered around him spoke in tones of commiseration and kindness he thanked them calmly, and with a cheerfulness which deceived them. They bore him to the nearest hospital, but as they would have laid him on a bed there he stopped them, with great energy and earnestness.",seem long time great suffering raise lay smooth pathway bridge cry groan little crowd gather speak tone commiseration kindness thank cheerfulness deceive bear near hospital lay bed stop great energy earnestness 
16,"“Let the doctor see me first,” he said, “and tell me whether I am likely to die or live.”",let doctor see say tell likely die live 
17,"The doctor’s hand touched him, and there were a few questions put to him, which he answered calmly; and then, as the doctor looked down upon him with a grave face, he looked back with perfect composure.",doctor hand touch be few question put answer doctor look grave face look perfect composure 
18,"“I’m a Christian man,” said Daniel, “and I’m not afraid to die. But if you think there’s no chance for me I’d rather go home. I’ve a little girl at home who’d like to be with me all the time till I’m taken away from her. The key of my house is in my pocket. Let me be taken home.”",christian man say afraid die think be chance go have little girl home like time take key house pocket let take 
19,"They could not refuse his request; but the doctor told him he might live yet for some days, though the injuries he had received gave no hope of his life; to which Daniel replied only by a solemn smile. It was nearly morning before he reached his house, under the care of a nurse and a student from the hospital; and thus he entered for the last time the home where he had spent the three happiest years of his life with Jessica.",refuse request doctor tell live day injury receive give hope life reply solemn smile morning reach house care nurse student hospital enter last time home spend happy year life
