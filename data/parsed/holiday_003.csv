4," Lady Harriet Graham was an extremely thin, delicate, old lady, with a very pale face, and a sweet gentle voice, which the children delighted to hear, for it always spoke kindly to them, and sounded like music, after the loud, rough tones of Mrs. Crabtree. She wore her own grey hair, which had become almost as white as the widow's cap which covered her head. The rest of her dress was generally black velvet, and she usually sat in a comfortable arm-chair by the fire-side, watching her grandchildren at play, with a large work-bag by her side, and a prodigious Bible open on the table before her. Lady Harriet often said that it made her young again to see the joyous gambols of Harry and Laura; and when unable any longer to bear their noise, she sometimes kept them quiet, by telling the most delightful stories about what had happened to herself when she was young.",thin delicate old lady pale face sweet gentle voice child delight hear speak sound music loud rough tone wear own grey hair become white widow cap cover head rest dress black velvet sit comfortable arm chair fire side watch grandchild play large work bag side prodigious open table say make young see joyous gambol unable bear noise keep quiet tell delightful story happen young 
5,"Once upon a time, however, Lady Harriet suddenly became so very ill, that Dr. Bell said she must spend a few days in the country, for change of air, and accordingly she determined on passing a quiet week at Holiday House with her relations, Lord and Lady Rockville. Meanwhile, Harry and Laura were to be left under the sole care of Mrs. Crabtree, so it might have been expected that they would both feel more frightened for her, now that she was reigning monarch of the house, than ever. Harry would obey those he loved, if they only held up a little finger; but all the terrors of Mrs. Crabtree, and her cat-o'-nine-tails, were generally forgotten soon after she left the room; therefore he thought little at first about the many threats she held out, if he behaved ill, but he listened most seriously when his dear sick grandmama told him, in a faint weak voice, on the day of her departure from home, how very well he ought to behave in her absence, as no one remained but the maids to keep him in order, and that she hoped Mrs. Crabtree would write her a letter full of good news about his excellent conduct.",time become ill say spend few day country change air determine pass quiet week relation leave sole care expect feel frighten reign monarch house obey love hold little finger terror cat o'- tail forget leave room think little first many threat hold behave ill listen dear sick grandmama tell faint weak voice day departure home behave absence remain maid keep order hope write letter full good news excellent conduct 
6,"Harry felt as if he would gladly sit still without stirring, till his grandmama came back, if that could only please her; and there never was any one more determined to be a good boy than he, at the moment when Lady Harriet's carriage came round to the door. Laura, Frank, and Harry helped to carry all the pillows, boxes, books, and baskets which were necessary for the journey, of which there seemed to be about fifty; then they arranged the cushions as comfortably as possible, and watched very sorrowfully when their grandmama, after kindly embracing them both, was carefully supported by Major Graham and her maid Harrison, into the chariot. Uncle David gave each of the children a pretty picture-book before taking leave, and said, as he was stepping into the carriage, ""Now, children! I have only one piece of serious, important advice to give you all, so attend to me!--never crack nuts with your teeth!""",feel sit stir grandmama come please be one determined good boy moment carriage come door help carry pillow box book basket necessary journey seem be arrange cushion possible watch grandmama embrace support maid chariot give child pretty picture book take leave say step carriage child have piece serious important advice give attend crack nut tooth 
7,"When the carriage had driven off, Mrs. Crabtree became so busy scolding Betty, and storming at Jack the foot-boy, for not cleaning her shoes well enough, that she left Harry and Laura standing in the passage, not knowing exactly what they ought to do first, and Frank, seeing them looking rather melancholy and bewildered at the loss of their grandmama, stopped a moment as he passed on the way to school, and said in a very kind, affectionate voice,",carriage drive become busy scold storm foot boy clean shoe leave stand passage know do see look melancholy bewilder loss grandmama stop moment pass way school say kind affectionate voice 
8,"""Now, Harry and Laura, listen both of you!--here is a grand opportunity to show everybody, that we can be trusted to ourselves, without getting into any scrapes, so that if grandmama is ever ill again, and obliged to go away, she need not feel so sad and anxious as she did to-day. I mean to become nine times more attentive to my lessons than usual this morning, to show how trust-worthy we are, and if you are wise, pray march straight up to the nursery yourselves. I have arranged a gown and cap of Mrs. Crabtree's on the large arm-chair, to look as like herself as possible, that you may be reminded how soon she will come back, and you must not behave like the mice when the cat is out. Good bye! Say the alphabet backward, and count your fingers for half-an-hour, but when Mrs. Crabtree appears again, pray do not jump out of the window for joy.""",listen grand opportunity show trust get scrape grandmama ill oblige go feel sad anxious do day mean become time attentive lesson usual morning show trust worthy wise pray nursery arrange gown cap large arm chair look possible remind come behave mouse cat good bye say alphabet count finger half hour appear pray jump window joy 
9,"Harry and Laura were proceeding directly towards the nursery, as Frank had recommended, when unluckily they observed in passing the drawing-room door, that it was wide open; so Harry peeped in, and they began idly wandering round the tables and cabinets. Not ten minutes elapsed before they both commenced racing about as if they were mad, perfectly screaming with joy, and laughing so loudly at their own funny tricks, that an old gentleman who lived next door, very nearly sent in a message to ask what the joke was.",proceed nursery recommend observe pass draw room door wide open peep begin wonder table cabinet minute elapse commence racing mad scream joy laugh own funny trick old gentleman live next door send message ask joke 
10,"Presently Harry and Laura ran up and down stairs till the housemaid was quite fatigued with running after them. They jumped upon the fine damask sofas in the drawing-room, stirred the fire till it was in a blaze, and rushed out on the balcony, upsetting one or two geraniums and a myrtle. They spilt Lady Harriet's perfumes over their handkerchiefs,--they looked into all the beautiful books of pictures,--they tumbled many of the pretty Dresden china figures on the floor,--they wound up the little French clock till it was broken,--they made the musical work-box play its tunes, and set the Chinese mandarins nodding, till they very nearly nodded their heads off. In short, so much mischief has seldom been done in so short a time, till at last Harry, perfectly worn out with laughing and running, threw himself into a large arm-chair, and Laura, with her ringlets tumbling in frightful confusion over her face, and the beads of her coral necklace rolling on the floor, tossed herself into a sofa beside him.",run stair housemaid fatigued run jump fine damask sofa draw room stirr fire blaze rush balcony upsetting geranium myrtle spilt perfume handkerchief look beautiful book picture tumble many pretty china figure floor wind little french clock break make musical work box play tune set chinese mandarin nodd nod head short much mischief do short time last wear laugh run throw large arm chair ringlet tumble frightful confusion face bead coral necklace roll floor toss sofa 
11,"""Oh! what fun!"" cried Harry, in an ecstacy of delight; ""I wish Frank had been here, and crowds of little boys and girls, to play with us all day! It would be a good joke, Laura, to write and ask all our little cousins and companions to drink tea here to-morrow evening! Their mamas could never guess we had not leave from grandmama to invite everybody, so I dare say we might gather quite a large party! oh! how enchanting!""",fun cry ecstacy delight wish crowd little boy girl play day good joke write ask little cousin companion drink tea evening mama guess leave grandmama invite say gather large party enchanting 
12,"Laura laughed heartily when she heard this proposal of Harry's, and without hesitating a moment about it, she joyously placed herself before Lady Harriet's writing-table, and scribbled a multitude of little notes, in large text, to more than twenty young friends, all of whom had at other times been asked by Lady Harriet to spend the evening with her.",laugh hear proposal hesitate moment place writing table scribble multitude little note large text more young friend other time ask spend evening 
13,"Laura felt very much puzzled to know what was usually said in a card of invitation, but after many consultations, she and Harry thought at last, that it was very nicely expressed, for they wrote these words upon a large sheet of paper to each of their friends:--",feel puzzled know say card invitation many consultation think last express write word large sheet paper friend 
14,"Master Harry Graham and Miss Laura wish you to have the honour of drinking tea with us to-morrow, at six o'clock.",master wish have honour drink tea o'clock

16,"Laura afterwards singed a hole in her muslin frock, while lighting one of the Vesta matches to seal these numerous notes; and Harry dropped some burning sealing-wax on his hand, in the hurry of assisting her; but he thought that little accident no matter, and ran away to see if the cards could be sent off immediately.",sing hole muslin frock light match seal numerous note drop burning sealing wax hand hurry assist think little accident matter run see card send 
17,"Now, there lived in the house a very old footman, called Andrew, who remembered Harry and Laura since they were quite little babies; and he often looked exceedingly sad and sorry when they suffered punishment from Mrs. Crabtree. He was ready to do anything in the world when it pleased the children, and would have carried a message to the moon, if they had only shown him the way. Many odd jobs and private messages he had already been employed in by Harry, who now called Andrew up stairs, entreating him to carry out all those absurd notes as fast as possible, and to deliver them immediately, as they were of the greatest consequence. Upon hearing this, old Andrew lost not a moment, but threw on his hat, and instantly started off, looking like the twopenny postman, he carried such a prodigious parcel of invitations, while Harry and Laura stood at the drawing-room window, almost screaming with joy when they saw him set out, and when they observed that, to oblige them, he actually ran along the street at a sort of trot, which was as fast as he could possibly go. Presently, however, he certainly did stop for a single minute, and Laura saw that it was in order to take a peep into one of the notes, that he might ascertain what they were all about; but as he never carried any letters without doing so, she thought that quite natural, and was only very glad when he had finished, and rapidly pursued his way again.",live house old footman call remember little baby look sad sorry suffer punishment ready do world pleased child carry message moon show way many odd job private message employ call stair entreat carry absurd note possible deliver great consequence hear old lose moment throw hat start look twopenny postman carry prodigious parcel invitation stand draw room window scream joy see set observe oblige run street sort trot fast go stop single minute see order take peep note ascertain carry letter do think natural glad finish pursue way 
18,"Next morning, Mrs. Crabtree and Betty became very much surprised to observe what a number of smart livery servants knocked at the street door, and gave in cards, but their astonishment became still greater, when old Andrew brought up a whole parcel of them to Harry and Laura, who immediately broke the seals, and read the contents in a corner together.",next morning become surprised observe number smart livery servant knock street door give card astonishment become great old bring whole parcel break seal read content corner 
19,"""What are you about there, Master Graham?"" cried Mrs. Crabtree, angrily, ""how dare any body venture to touch your grandmama's letters?""",cry dare body venture touch grandmama letter 
20,"""They are not for grandmama!--they are all for us!--every one of them!"" answered Harry, dancing about the room with joy, and waving the notes over his head. ""Look at this direction! For Master and Miss Graham! put on your spectacles, and read it yourself, Mrs. Crabtree! What delightful fun! the house will be as full as an egg!""",grandmama answer dance room joy wave note head look direction master put spectacle read delightful fun house full egg 
21,"Mrs. Crabtree seemed completely puzzled what to think of all this, and looked so much as if she did not know exactly what to be angry at, and so ready to be in a passion if possible, that Harry burst out a laughing, while he said, ""Only think Mrs. Crabtree! here is every body coming to tea with us!--all my cousins, besides Peter Grey, Robert Stewart, Charles Forrester, Adelaide Cunninghame, Diana Wentworth, John Fordyce, Edmund Ashford, Frank Abercromby, Ned Russel, and Tom ----""",seem puzzled think look know angry ready passion possible burst laugh say think body come tea cousin 
22,"""The boy is distracted!"" exclaimed Betty, staring with astonishment. ""What does all this mean, Master Harry?""",boy distract exclaim stare astonishment mean 
23,"""And who gave you leave to invite company into your grandmama's house?"" cried Mrs. Crabtree, snatching up all the notes, and angrily thrusting them into the fire. ""I never heard of such things in all my life before, Master Harry! but as sure as eggs is eggs, you shall repent of this, for not one morsel of cake, or anything else shall you have to give any of the party; no! not so much as a crust of bread, or a thimbleful of tea!""",give leave invite company grandmama house cry snatch note thrust fire hear such thing life sure egg egg repent morsel cake else have give party much crust bread thimbleful tea 
24,"Harry and Laura had never thought of such a catastrophe as this before; they always saw a great table covered with every thing that could be named for tea, whenever their little friends came to visit them, and whether it rose out of the floor, or was brought by Aladdin's lamp, they never considered it possible that the table would not be provided as usual on such occasions, so this terrible speech of Mrs. Crabtree's frightened them out of their wits. What was to be done! They both knew by experience that she always did whatever she threatened, or something a great deal worse, so they began by bursting into tears, and begging Mrs. Crabtree for this once to excuse them, and to give some cakes and tea to their little visitors, but they might as well have spoken to one of the Chinese mandarins, for she only shook her head, with a positive look, declaring over and over again that nothing should appear upon the table except what was always brought up for their own supper--two biscuits and two cups of milk.",think catastrophe see great table cover thing name tea little friend come visit rise floor bring lamp consider possible table provide usual such occasion terrible speech frighten wit do know experience do threaten great deal bad begin burst tear begg excuse give cake tea little visitor speak chinese mandarin shake head positive look declare appear table bring own supper biscuit cup milk 
25,"""Therefore say no more about it!"" added she, sternly. ""I am your best friend, Master Harry, trying to teach you and Miss Laura your duty, so save your breath to cool your porridge.""",say more add good friend try teach miss duty save breath cool porridge 
26,"Poor Harry and Laura looked perfectly ill with fright and vexation when they thought of what was to happen next, while Mrs. Crabtree sat down to her knitting, grumbling to herself, and dropping her stitches every minute with rage and irritation. Old Andrew felt exceedingly sorry after he heard what distress and difficulty Harry was in, and when the hour for the party approached, he very good-naturedly spread out a large table in the dining-room, where he put down as many cups, saucers, plates, and spoons as Laura chose to direct; but in spite of all his trouble, though it looked very grand, there was nothing whatever to eat or drink, except the two dry biscuits, and the two miserable cups of milk, which seemed to become smaller every time that Harry looked at them.",poor look ill fright vexation think happen sit knitting grumble drop stitche minute rage irritation old feel sorry hear distress difficulty hour party approach good spread large table dining room put many cup saucer plate spoon choose direct spite trouble look grand be eat drink dry biscuit miserable cup milk seem become small time look 
27,"Presently the clock struck six, and Harry listened to the hour very much as a prisoner would do in the condemned cell in Newgate, feeling that the dreaded time was at last arrived. Soon afterwards, several handsome carriages drove up to the door filled with little Masters and Misses, who hurried joyfully into the house, talking and laughing all the way up stairs, being evidently quite happy at coming out to tea, while poor Harry and Laura almost wished the floor would open and swallow them up, so they shrunk into a distant corner of the room, quite ashamed to show their faces.",clock strike listen hour prisoner do condemn cell feel dread time last arrive several handsome carriage drive door fill little hurry house talk laugh way stair happy come tea poor wish floor open swallow shrink distant corner room ashamed show face 
28,"The young ladies were all dressed in their best frocks, with pink sashes, and pink shoes; while the little boys appeared in their holiday clothes, with their hair newly brushed, and their faces washed. The whole party had dined at two o'clock, so they were as hungry as hawks, looking eagerly round, whenever they entered, to see what was on the tea-table, and evidently surprised that nothing had yet been put down. Laura and Harry soon afterwards heard their visitors whispering to each other about Norwich buns, rice cakes, spunge biscuits, and maccaroons; while Peter Grey was loud in praise of a party at George Lorraine's the night before, where an immense plum-cake had been sugared over like a snow storm, and covered with crowds of beautiful amusing mottoes; not to mention a quantity of noisy crackers, that exploded like pistols; besides which, a glass of hot jelly had been handed to each little guest before he was sent home.",young lady dress good frock pink sashe pink shoe little boy appear holiday clothes hair brush face wash whole party dine o'clock hungry hawk look enter see tea table surprise put hear visitor whisper other bun rice cake spunge biscuit maccaroon loud praise party night immense plum cake sugare snow storm cover crowd beautiful amusing mottoe mention quantity noisy cracker explode pistol glass hot jelly hand little guest send 
29,"Every time the door opened, all eyes were anxiously turned round, expecting a grand feast to be brought in; but quite the contrary--it was only Andrew showing up more hungry visitors; while Harry felt so unspeakably wretched, that, if some kind fairy could only have turned him into a Norwich bun at the moment, he would gladly have consented to be cut in pieces, that his ravenous guests might be satisfied.",time door open eye turn expect grand feast bring contrary show hungry visitor feel wretched kind fairy turn bun moment consent cut piece ravenous guest satisfy 
30,"Charles Forrester was a particularly good-natured boy, so Harry at last took courage and beckoned him into a remote corner of the room, where he confessed, in whispers, the real state of affairs about tea, and how sadly distressed he and Laura felt, because they had nothing whatever to give among so many visitors, seeing that Mrs. Crabtree kept her determination of affording them no provisions.",good natured boy last take courage beckon remote corner room confess whisper real state affair tea distressed feel have give many visitor see keep determination afford provision 
31,"""What is to be done!"" said Charles, very anxiously, as he felt extremely sorry for his little friends. ""If Mama had been at home, she would gladly have sent whatever you liked for tea, but unluckily she is dining out! I saw a loaf of bread lying on a table at home this evening, which she would make you quite welcome to! Shall I run home, as fast as possible, to fetch it? That would, at any rate, be better than nothing!""",do say feel sorry little friend home send like tea dine see loaf bread lie table home evening make welcome run possible fetch rate good 
32,"Poor Charles Forrester was very lame, therefore, while he talked of running he could hardly walk, but Lady Forrester's house stood so near, that he soon reached home, when, snatching up the loaf, he hurried back towards the street with his prize, quite delighted to see how large and substantial it looked. Scarcely had he reached the door, however, before the housekeeper ran hastily out, saying,",poor lame talk run walk house stand reach snatch loaf hurry street prize delighted see large substantial look reach door housekeeper run say 
33,"""Stop, Mr. Charles! stop! sure you are not running away with the loaf for my tea, and the parrot must have her supper too. What do you want with that there bread?""",stop stop sure run loaf tea parrot have supper want bread 
34,"""Never mind, Mrs. Comfit!"" answered Charles, hastening on faster than ever, while he grasped the precious loaf more firmly in his hand, and limped along at a prodigious rate, ""Polly is getting too fat, so she will be the better of fasting for this one day.""",mind answer hasten fast grasp precious loaf hand limp prodigious rate get fat good fast day 
35,"Mrs. Comfit, being enormously fat herself, became very angry at this remark, so she seemed quite desperate to recover the loaf, and hurried forward to overtake Charles, but the old housekeeper was so heavy and breathless, while the young gentleman was so lame, that it seemed an even chance which won the race. Harry stood at his own door, impatiently hoping to receive the prize, and eagerly stretched out his arms to encourage his friend, while it was impossible to say which of the runners might arrive first. Harry had sometimes heard of a race between two old women tied up in sacks, and he thought they could scarcely move with more difficulty; but at the very moment when Charles had reached the door, he stumbled over a stone, and fell on the ground. Mrs. Comfit then instantly rushed up, and seizing the loaf, she carried it off in triumph, leaving the two little friends ready to cry with vexation, and quite at a loss what plan to attempt next.",fat become angry remark seem desperate recover loaf hurry overtake old housekeeper heavy breathless young gentleman lame seem even chance win race stand own door hope receive prize stretch arm encourage friend impossible say runner arrive hear race old woman tie sack think move more difficulty very moment reach door stumble stone fall ground rush seize loaf carry triumph leave little friend ready cry vexation loss plan attempt 
36,"Mean time, a sad riot had arisen in the dining-room, where the boys called loudly for their tea; and the young ladies drew their chairs all round the table, to wait till it was ready. Still nothing appeared; so every body wondered more and more how long they were to wait for all the nice cakes and sweetmeats which must, of course, be coming; for the longer they were delayed, the more was expected.",mean time sad riot arise dining room boy call tea young lady draw chair table wait ready appear body wonder wait nice cake sweetmeat course come long delay more expect 
37,"The last at a feast, and the first at a fray, was generally Peter Grey, who now lost patience, and seized one of the two biscuits, which he was in the middle of greedily devouring, when Laura returned with Harry to the dining-room, and observed what he had done.",last feast first fray lose patience seize biscuit middle devour return dining room observe do 
38,"""Peter Grey!"" said she, holding up her head, and trying to look very dignified, ""you are an exceedingly naughty boy, to help yourself! As a punishment for being so rude, you shall have nothing more to eat all this evening.""",say hold head try look dignified naughty boy help punishment rude have more eat evening 
39,"""If I do not help myself, nobody else seems likely to give me any supper! I appear to be the only person who is to taste anything to-night,"" answered Peter, laughing, while the impudent boy took a cup of milk, and drank it off, saying, ""Here's to your very good health, Miss Laura, and an excellent appetite to everybody!""",help else seem likely give supper appear only person taste night answer laugh impudent boy take cup milk drink say good health excellent appetite 
40,"Upon hearing this absurd speech, all the other boys began laughing, and made signs, as if they were eating their fingers off with hunger. Then Peter called Lady Harriet's house ""Famine Castle,"" and pretended he would swallow the knives like an Indian juggler.",hear absurd speech other boy begin laugh make sign eat finger hunger call house pretend swallow knife indian juggler

42,"""Peter! would you like a roasted fly?"" asked Frank Abercromby, catching one on the window. ""I dare say it is excellent for hungry people,--or a slice of buttered wall?""",like roast fly ask catching window say excellent hungry person slice butter wall 
43,"""Or a stewed spider?"" asked Peter. ""Shall we all be cannibals, and eat one another?""",stew spider ask cannibal eat 
44,"""What is the use of all those forks, when there is nothing to stick upon them?"" asked George Maxwell, throwing them about on the floor. ""No buns!--no fruit!--no cakes!--no nothing!""",use fork be stick ask throw floor bun fruit cake 
45,"""What are we to do with those tea-cups, when there is no tea?"" cried Frank Abercromby, pulling the table-cloth till the whole affair fell prostrate on the floor. After this, these riotous boys tossed the plates up in the air, and caught them, becoming, at last, so outrageous, that poor old Andrew called them a ""meal mob."" Never was there so much broken china seen in a dining-room before! It all lay scattered on the floor, in countless fragments, looking as if there had been a bull in a china shop, when suddenly Mrs. Crabtree herself opened the door and walked in, with an aspect of rage enough to petrify a milestone. Now old Andrew had long been trying all in his power to render the boys quiet and contented. He had made them a speech,--he had chased the ring-leaders all round the room,--and he had thrown his stick at Peter, who seemed the most riotous,--but all in vain; they became worse and worse, laughing into fits, and calling Andrew ""the police-officer,"" and ""the bailiff."" It was a very different story, however, when Mrs. Crabtree appeared, so flaming with fury, she might have blown up a powder-mill.",do tea- cup be tea cry pull table cloth whole affair fall prostrate floor riotous boy toss plate air catch become last outrageous poor old call meal mob be much break china see dining room lay scatter floor countless fragment look be bull china shop open door walk aspect rage petrify milestone old try power render boy quiet contented make speech chase ring leader room throw stick seem riotous vain become bad bad laugh fit call police officer bailiff different story appear flame fury blow powder mill 
46,"Nobody could help being afraid of her. Even Peter himself stood stock-still, and seemed withering away to nothing, when she looked at him; and when she began to scold in her most furious manner, not a boy ventured to look off the ground. A large pair of tawse then became visible in her hand, so every heart sunk with fright, and the riotous visitors began to get behind each other, and to huddle out of sight as much as possible, whispering and pushing, and fighting, in a desperate scuffle to escape.",help afraid stand stock seem wither look begin scold furious manner boy venture look ground large pair tawse become visible hand heart sink fright riotous visitor begin get other huddle sight possible whisper push fight desperate scuffle escape 
47,"""What is all this!"" cried she, at the full pitch of her voice, ""has bedlam broke loose! who smashed these cups? I'll break his head for him, let me tell you that! Master Peter! you should be hissed out of the world for your misconduct; but I shall certainly whip you round the room like a whipping-top.""",cry full pitch voice bedlam break smash cup break head let tell master hiss world misconduct whip room whipping top 
48,"At this moment, Peter observed that the dining-room window, which was only about six feet from the ground, had been left wide open, so instantly seizing the opportunity, he threw himself out with a single bound, and ran laughing away. All the other boys immediately followed his example, and disappeared by the same road; after which, Mrs. Crabtree leaned far out of the window, and scolded loudly, as long as they remained in sight, till her face became red, and her voice perfectly hoarse.",moment observe dining room window foot ground leave wide open seize opportunity throw single bind run laugh other boy follow example disappear same road learn window scold remain sight face become red voice hoarse 
49,"Meantime, the little misses sat soberly down before the empty table, and talked in whispers to each other, waiting till their maids came to take them home, after which they all hurried away as fast as possible, hardly waiting to say ""good bye,"" and intending to ask for some supper at home.",little misse sit empty table talk whisper other wait maid come take hurry possible wait say good bye intend ask supper home 
50,"During that night, long after Harry and Laura had been scolded, whipped, and put to bed, they were each heard in different rooms, sobbing and crying, as if their very hearts would break, while Mrs. Crabtree grumbled and scolded to herself, saying she must do her duty, and make them good children, though she were to flay them alive first.",night scold whip put bed hear different room sobb cry very heart break grumble scold say do duty make good child flay alive 
51,"When Lady Harriet returned home some days afterwards, she heard an account of Harry and Laura's misconduct from Mrs. Crabtree, and the whole story was such a terrible case against them, that their poor grandmama became perfectly astonished and shocked, while even uncle David was preparing to be very angry; but before the culprits appeared, Frank most kindly stepped forward, and begged that they might be pardoned for this once, adding all in his power to excuse Harry and Laura, by describing how very penitent they had become, and how very severely they had already been punished.",return day hear account misconduct whole story terrible case poor grandmama become astonished shocked uncle prepare angry culprit appear step begg pardon add power excuse describe penitent become punish 
52,"Frank then mentioned all that Harry had told him about the starving party, which he related with so much humour and drollery, that Lady Harriet could not help laughing; so then he saw that a victory had been gained, and ran to the nursery for the two little prisoners.",mention tell starve party relate much humour drollery help laugh see victory gain run nursery little prisoner 
53,"Uncle David shook his walking-stick at them, and made a terrible face, when they entered; but Harry jumped upon his knee with joy at seeing him again, while Laura forgot all her distress, and rushed up to Lady Harriet, who folded her in her arms, and kissed her most affectionately.",shake walking stick make terrible face enter jump knee joy see forget distress rush fold arm kiss 
54,"Not a word was said that day about the tea-party, but next morning, Major Graham asked Harry, very gravely, ""if he had read in the newspapers the melancholy accounts about several of his little companions, who were ill and confined to bed from having ate too much at a certain tea-party on Saturday last. Poor Peter Grey has been given over, and Charles Forrester, it is feared, may not be able to eat another loaf of bread for a fortnight!""",word say day tea party next morning ask read newspaper melancholy account several little companion ill confine bed eat much certain tea-party last poor give fear able eat loaf bread fortnight 
55,"""Oh! uncle David! it makes me ill whenever I think of that party!"" said Harry, colouring perfectly scarlet; ""that was the most miserable evening of my life!""",uncle make ill think party say colour scarlet miserable evening life 
56,"""I must say it was not quite fair in Mrs. Crabtree to starve all the strange little boys and girls, who came as visitors to my house, without knowing who had invited them,"" observed Lady Harriet. ""Probably those unlucky children will never forget, as long as they live, that scanty supper in our dining-room.""",say fair starve strange little boy girl come visitor house know invite observe unlucky child forget live scanty supper dining room 
57,"And it turned out exactly as Lady Harriet had predicted; for though they were all asked to tea, in proper time, the very next Saturday, when Major Graham showered torrents of sugar-plums on the table, while the children scrambled to pick them up, and the side-board almost broke down afterwards under the weight of buns, cakes, cheesecakes, biscuits, fruit, and preserves, which were heaped upon each other--yet, for years afterwards, Peter Grey, whenever he ate a particularly enormous dinner, always observed, that he must make up for having once been starved at Harry Graham's; and whenever any one of those little boys or girls again happened to meet Harry or Laura, they were sure to laugh and say, ""When are you going to give us another",turn predict ask tea proper time next shower torrent sugar plum table child scramble pick side board break weight bun cake cheesecake biscuit fruit preserve heap other year eat enormous dinner observe make starve one little boy girl happen meet sure laugh say go give
