To your abodes, bright daisy flowers,      He then would steal at leisure hours,      And loved you, glittering in your bowers,         A starry multitude.

5," Harry’s last home morning was brightened by going to the school to see full justice done to Norman, and enjoying the scene for him. It was indeed a painful ordeal to Norman himself, who could, at the moment, scarcely feel pleasure in his restoration, excepting for the sake of his father, Harry, and his sisters. To find the head-master making apologies to him was positively painful and embarrassing, and his countenance would have been fitter for a culprit receiving a lecture. It was pleasanter when the two other masters shook hands with him, Mr. Harrison with a free confession that he had done him injustice, and Mr. Wilmot with a glad look of congratulation, that convinced Harry he had never believed Norman to blame.",last home morning brighten go school see full justice do enjoy scene painful ordeal moment feel pleasure restoration except sake father sister find head master make apology painful embarrassing countenance fitter culprit receive lecture pleasanter other master shake hand free confession do injustice glad look congratulation convince believe blame 
6,"Harry himself was somewhat of a hero; the masters all spoke to him, bade him good speed, and wished him a happy voyage, and all the boys were eager to admire his uniform, and wish themselves already men and officers like Mr. May. He had his long-desired three cheers for “May senior!” shouted with a thorough goodwill by the united lungs of the Whichcote foundation, and a supplementary cheer arose for the good ship Alcestis, while hands were held out on every side; and the boy arrived at such a pitch of benevolence and good humour, as actually to volunteer a friendly shake of the hand to Edward Anderson, whom he encountered skulking apart.",hero master speak bid good speed wish happy voyage boy eager admire uniform wish man officer have long desire cheer senior shout thorough goodwill united lung foundation supplementary cheer arise good ship hand hold side boy arrive pitch benevolence good humour volunteer friendly shake hand encounter skulk

8,"Edward did not refuse the offered grasp, and though his words were only, “Good-bye, I hope you will have plenty of fun!” Harry went away with a lighter heart.",refuse offer grasp word good hope have plenty fun go light heart 
9,"The rest of the day Harry adhered closely to his father, though chiefly in silence; Dr. May had intended much advice and exhortation for his warm-hearted, wild-spirited son, but words would not come, not even when in the still evening twilight they walked down alone together to the cloister, and stood over the little stone marked M. M. After standing there for some minutes, Harry knelt to collect some of the daisies in the grass.",rest day adhere father silence intend much advice exhortation warm hearted wild spirit son word come evening twilight walk cloister stand little stone mark stand minute knolt collect daisy grass

13,"That was all Dr. May contrived to say to his son, nor could Margaret do much more than kiss him, while tears flowed one by one over her cheeks, as she tried to whisper that he must remember and guard himself, and that he was sure of being thought of, at least, in every prayer; and then she fastened into his book the cross, formed of flattened daisies, gummed upon a framework of paper. He begged her to place it at the Baptismal Service, for he said, “I like that about fighting--and I always did like the church being like a ship--don’t you? I only found that prayer out the day poor little Daisy was christened.”",contrive say son do more kiss tear flow cheek try whisper remember guard sure think least prayer fasten book cross form flateen daisy gumm framework paper begg place baptismal say like fight do like church ship find prayer day poor little christen

15,"That last evening of home good-nights cost Harry many a choking sob ere he could fall asleep; but the morning of departure had more cheerfulness; the pleasure of patronising Jem Jennings was as consoling to his spirits, as was to Mary the necessity of comforting Toby.",last evening home good night cost many choke sob fall asleep morning departure have more cheerfulness pleasure patronise consoling spirit necessity comforting 
16,"Toby’s tastes were in some respects vulgar, as he preferred the stable, and Will Adams, to all Mary’s attentions; but he attached himself vehemently to Dr. May, followed him everywhere, and went into raptures at the slightest notice from him. The doctor said it was all homage to the master of the house. Margaret held that the dog was a physiognomist.",taste respect vulgar prefer stable attention attach follow go rapture slight notice doctor say homage master house hold dog physiognomist 
17,"The world was somewhat flat after the loss of Harry--that element of riot and fun; Aubrey was always playing at “poor Harry sailing away,”  Mary looked staid and sober, and Norman was still graver, and more devoted to books, while Ethel gave herself up more completely to the thickening troubles of Cocksmoor.",world flat loss element riot fun play poor sail look staid sober graver devote book give thicken trouble 
18,"Jealousies had arisen there, and these, with some rebukes for failures in sending children to be taught, had led to imputations on the character of Mrs. Green, in whose house the school was kept. Ethel was at first vehement in her defence; then when stronger evidence was adduced of the woman’s dishonesty, she was dreadfully shocked, and wanted to give up all connection with her, and in both moods was equally displeased with Richard for pausing, and not going all lengths with her.",pealousy arise rebuke failure send child teach lead imputation character house school keep first vehement defence strong evidence adduce woman dishonesty shocked want give connection mood displease pause go length 
19,"Mr. Wilmot was appealed to, and did his best to investigate, but the only result was to discover that no one interrogated had any notion of truth, except John Taylor, and he knew nothing of the matter. The mass of falsehood, spite, violence, and dishonesty, that became evident, was perfectly appalling, and not a clue was to be found to the truth--scarcely a hope that minds so lost to honourable feeling were open to receive good impressions. It was a great distress to Ethel--it haunted her night and day--she lay awake pondering on the vain hopes for her poor children, and slept to dream of the angry faces and rude accusations. Margaret grew quite anxious about her, and her elders were seriously considering the propriety of her continuing her labours at Cocksmoor.",appeal do good investigate only result discover interrogate have notion truth know matter mass falsehood spite violence dishonesty become evident appalling clue find truth hope mind lose honourable feeling open receive good impression great distress haunt night day lay ponder vain hope poor child sleep dream angry face rude accusation grow anxious elder consider propriety continue labour 
20,"Mr. Wilmot would not be at Stoneborough after Christmas. His father’s declining health made him be required at home, and since Richard was so often absent, it became matter of doubt whether the Misses May ought to be allowed to persevere, unassisted by older heads, in such a locality.",father decline health make require home absent become matter doubt allow persevere unassist old head locality 
21,"This doubt put Ethel into an agony. Though she had lately been declaring that it made her very unhappy to go--she could not bear the sight of Mrs. Green, and that she knew all her efforts were vain while the poor children had such homes; she now only implored to be allowed to go on; she said that the badness of the people only made it more needful to do their utmost for them; there were no end to the arguments that she poured forth upon her ever kind listener, Margaret.",doubt put agony declare make unhappy go bear sight know effort vain poor child have such home implore allow go say badness person make needful do utmost be end argument pour kind listener

30,"Margaret drew her down close to her, and whispered, “Trust them Ethel, dear. The decision will be whatever is the will of God. If He thinks fit to give you the work, it will come; if not, He will give you some other, and provide for them.”",draw whisper trust dear decision will think fit give work come give other provide 
31,"“If I have been too neglectful of home, too vain of persevering when no one but Richard would!” sighed Ethel.",neglectful home vain persever sigh

Getting into these fits of despair is the very thing to make people decide against you.”",see have say own heart tell try calm patient get fit despair very thing make person decide

34,"Margaret gave a little space for the struggle with herself, then advised her resolutely to fix her attention on something else. It was a Saturday morning, and time was more free than usual, so Margaret was able to persuade her to continue a half-forgotten drawing, while listening to an interesting article in a review, which opened to her that there were too many Cocksmoors in the world.",give little space struggle advise fix attention else morning time free usual able persuade continue half forget draw listen interesting article review open be many world 
35,"The dinner-hour sounded too soon, and as she was crossing the hall to put away her drawing materials, the front door gave the click peculiar to Dr. May’s left-handed way of opening it. She paused, and saw him enter, flushed, and with a look that certified her that something had happened.",dinner hour sound cross hall put draw material front door give click peculiar left handed way open pause see enter flush look certify happen

The expression of mystery and amusement gave way to sadness and gravity as he sat down in his arm-chair, and sighed as if much fatigued. She was checked and alarmed, but she could not help asking, “Is he here?”",hold finger draw study shut door expression mystery amusement give way sadness gravity sit arm chair sigh fatigue check alarm help ask

Oh, Ethel, if your mother were but here!”",know fact fine young fellow attach find heart send year see poor thing good mother 
49,"He rested his forehead on his hands, and Ethel stood aghast at his unexpected reception of the addresses for which she had so long hoped. She did not venture to speak, and presently he roused himself as the dinner-bell rang. “One comfort is,” he said, “that Margaret has more composure than I.

52,"It was not flattering to be thus cleared out of the way, especially when full of excited curiosity, but any such sensation was quite overborne by sympathy in his great anxiety, and Ethel’s only question was, “Had not Flora better stay to keep off company?”",flattering clear way full excited curiosity such sensation overborne sympathy great anxiety only question stay keep company 
53,"“No, no,” said Dr. May impatiently, “the fewer the better;” and hastily passing her, he dashed up to his room, nearly running over the nursery procession, and, in a very few seconds, was seated at table, eating and speaking by snatches, and swallowing endless draughts of cold water.",say few good pass dash room run nursery procession few second seat table eat speak snatch swallow endless draught cold water

He is of no use in such cases, only makes things worse. I should not feel justified in leaving Margaret with no one else, but he is in one of those hand-over-head moods, when it is not of the least use to say a word to him.”",do favour speak say show right leave one hand case overcome use such case make thing bad feel justify leave else hand head mood least use say word

79,"Richard had been hearing all from his father, and it was comfortable to talk the matter over with him, and hear explained the anxiety which frightened her, while she scarcely comprehended it; how Dr. May could not feel certain whether it was right or expedient to promote an engagement which must depend on health so uncertain as poor Margaret’s, and how he dreaded the effect on the happiness of both.",hear father comfortable talk matter hear explain anxiety frighten comprehend feel certain right expedient promote engagement depend health uncertain poor dread effect happiness

81,"Her lessons were somewhat nervous and flurried, and even the sight of two very nice neat new scholars, of very different appearance from the rest, and of much superior attainments, only half interested her.

82,"Ethel thought it quite provoking in her brother to accede to Mary’s entreaties that they should go and call on this promising importation. Even the children’s information that they were taught now by “Sister Cherry” failed to attract her; but Richard looked at his watch, and decided that it was too soon to go home, and she had to submit to her fate.",think provoking brother accede entreaty go call promising importation child information teach fail attract look watch decide go have submit fate 
83,"Very different was the aspect of the house from the wild Irish cabin appearance that it had in the M’Carthy days. It was the remains of an old farm-house that had seen better days, somewhat larger than the general run of the Cocksmoor dwellings. Respectable furniture had taken up its abode against the walls, the kitchen was well arranged, and, in spite of the wretched flooring and broken windows, had an air of comfort. A very tidy woman was bustling about, still trying to get rid of the relics of her former tenants, who might, she much feared, have left a legacy of typhus fever. The more interesting person was, however, a young woman of three or four and twenty, pale, and very lame, and with the air of a respectable servant, her manners particularly pleasing. It appeared that she was the daughter of a first wife, and, after the period of schooling, had been at service, but had been lamed by a fall downstairs, and had been obliged to come home, just as scarcity of work had caused her father to leave his native parish, and seek employment at other quarries. She had hoped to obtain plain work, but all the family were dismayed and disappointed at the wild spot to which they had come, and anxiously availed themselves of this introduction to beg that the elder boy and girl might be admitted into the town school, distant as it was. At another time, the thought of Charity Elwood would have engrossed Ethel’s whole mind, now she could hardly attend, and kept looking eagerly at Richard as he talked endlessly with the good mother. When, at last, they did set off, he would not let her gallop home like a steam-engine, but made her take his arm, when he found that she could not otherwise moderate her steps. At the long hill a figure appeared, and, as soon as Richard was certified of its identity, he let her fly, like a bolt from a crossbow, and she stood by Dr. May’s side.",different aspect house wild irish cabin appearance have day remains old farm house see good day large general run dwelling respectable furniture take abode wall kitchen arrange spite wretch flooring break window have air comfort tidy woman bustle try get rid relic former tenant fear leave legacy typhus fever interesting person young woman pale lame air respectable servant manners pleasing appear daughter first wife period schooling service lame fall downstairs oblige come scarcity work cause father leave native parish seek employment other quarry hope obtain plain work family dismay disappoint wild spot come avail introduction beg elder boy girl admit town school distant time thought engross whole mind attend keep look talk good mother last set let gallop steam engine make take arm find moderate step long hill figure appear certify identity let fly bolt crossbow stand side

My miserable carelessness has undone you all!” he concluded, almost inaudibly.",good chance dreary lookout young thing wise hand see right do miserable carelessness undone conclude 
98,"It was indeed, to him, a time of great distress and perplexity, wishing to act the part of father and mother both towards his daughter, acutely feeling his want of calm decision, and torn to pieces at once by sympathy with the lovers, and by delicacy that held him back from seeming to bind the young man to an uncertain engagement, above all, tortured by self-reproach for the commencement of the attachment, and for the misfortune that had rendered its prosperity doubtful.",time great distress perplexity wish act part father mother daughter feel want calm decision tear piece sympathy lover delicacy hold seem bind young man uncertain engagement torture self reproach commencement attachment misfortune render prosperity doubtful

100,"At the door, Dr. May asked for Flora, and Ethel explained. If Flora had obtruded herself, he would have been irritated, but, as it was, he had no time to observe the disobedience, and saying that he hoped she was with Margaret, sent Ethel into the drawing-room.",door ask explain obtrude irritate have time observe disobedience say hope send draw room

115,"The message quickened Ethel, and after giving it, and reporting consolingly to her father, she went up to Flora, who had been a voluntary prisoner upstairs all this time, and was not peculiarly gratified at such tidings coming only through the medium of Ethel. She had before been sensible that, superior in discretion and effectiveness as she was acknowledged to be, she did not share so much of the confidence and sympathy as some of the others, and she felt mortified and injured, though in this case it was entirely her own fault. The sense of alienation grew upon her.",message quicken give report father go voluntary prisoner time gratified such tiding come medium sensible superior discretion effectiveness acknowledge share much confidence sympathy other feel mortify injure case own fault sense alienation grow 
116,"She dressed quickly, and hurried down, that she might see Margaret alone; but the room was already prepared for tea, and the children were fast assembling. Ethel came down a few minutes after, and found Blanche claiming Alan Ernescliffe as her lawful property, dancing round him, chattering, and looking injured if he addressed a word to any one else.",dress hurry see room prepare tea child fast assemble come few minute find claim lawful property dance chatter look injure address word one else 
117,"How did lovers look? was a speculation which had, more than once, occupied Ethel, and when she had satisfied herself that her father was at ease, she began to study it, as soon as a shamefaced consciousness would allow her, after Alan’s warm shake of the hand.",lover look speculation more occupy satisfy father ease begin study shamefaced consciousness allow warm shake hand 
118,"Margaret looked much as usual, only with more glow and brightness--Mr. Ernescliffe, not far otherwise; he was as pale and slight as on his last visit, with the same soft blue eyes, capable, however, of a peculiar, keen, steady glance when he was listening, and which now seemed to be attending to Margaret’s every word or look, through all the delighted uproar which Aubrey, Blanche, and Mary kept up round him, or while taking his share in the general conversation, telling of Harry’s popularity and good conduct on board the Alcestis, or listening to the history of Norman’s school adventures, which he had heard, in part, from Harry, and how young Jennings was entered in the flag-ship, as a boy, though not yet to sail with his father.",look usual more glow brightness pale slight last visit same soft blue eye capable peculiar keen steady glance listen seem attend word look delighted uproar keep take share general conversation tell popularity good conduct board listen history school adventure hear part young enter flag ship boy sail father 
119,"After the storm of the day the sky seemed quite clear, and Ethel could not see that being lovers made much difference; to be sure papa displeased Blanche, by calling her away to his side, when she would squeeze her chair in between Alan’s and the sofa; and Alan took all the waiting on Margaret exclusively to himself. Otherwise, there was nothing remarkable, and he was very much the same Mr. Ernescliffe whom they had received a year ago.",storm day sky seem clear see lover make much difference sure papa displease call side squeeze chair sofa take waiting be remarkable same receive year 
120,"In truth, the next ten days were very happy. The future was left to rest, and Alan spent his mornings in the drawing-room alone with Margaret, and looked ever more brightly placid, while, with the rest, he was more than the former kind playfellow, for he now took his place as the affectionate elder brother, entering warmly into all their schemes and pleasures, and winning for himself a full measure of affection from all; even his little god-daughter began to know him, and smile at his presence. Margaret and Ethel especially delighted in the look of enjoyment with which their father sat down to enter on the evening’s conversation after the day’s work; and Flora was well pleased that Mrs. Hoxton should find Alan in the drawing-room, and ask afterwards about his estate; and that Meta Rivers, after being certified that this was their Mr. Ernescliffe, pronounced that her papa thought him particularly pleasing and gentlemanlike. There was something dignified in having a sister on the point of being engaged.",truth next day happy future leave rest spend morning draw room look placid rest more former kind playfellow take place affectionate elder brother enter scheme pleasure win full measure affection little god daughter begin know smile presence delight look enjoyment father sit enter evening conversation day work pleased find draw room ask estate certify pronounce papa think pleasing gentlemanlike be dignified have sister point engage
