4,"The next morning, at first lesson, Tom was turned back in his lines, and so had to wait till the second round; while Martin and Arthur said theirs all right, and got out of school at once. When Tom got out and ran down to breakfast at Harrowell’s they were missing, and Stumps informed him that they had swallowed down their breakfasts and gone off together--where, he couldn’t say. Tom hurried over his own breakfast, and went first to Martin’s study and then to his own; but no signs of the missing boys were to be found. He felt half angry and jealous of Martin. Where could they be gone?",next morning first lesson turn line have wait second round say right get school get run breakfast miss stump inform swallow breakfast go say hurry own breakfast go study own sign missing boy find feel half angry jealous gone 
5,"He learnt second lesson with East and the rest in no very good temper, and then went out into the quadrangle. About ten minutes before school Martin and Arthur arrived in the quadrangle breathless; and catching sight of him, Arthur rushed up, all excitement, and with a bright glow on his face.",learn second lesson rest good temper go quadrangle minute school arrive quadrangle breathless catching sight rush excitement bright glow face

9,The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur shrink up in a moment and look piteous; and Tom with a shrug of his shoulders turned his anger on Martin.,tone reproach make poor little shrink moment look piteous shrug shoulder turn anger

13,"“Indeed, Tom, now,” pleaded Arthur, “my feet ain’t wet, for Martin made me take off my shoes and stockings and trousers.”",plead foot wet make take shoe stocking trousers

15,"O Tom, you old humbug! you to be upbraiding any one with not learning their lessons! If you hadn’t been floored yourself now at first lesson, do you mean to say you wouldn’t have been with them? And you’ve taken away all poor little Arthur’s joy and pride in his first birds’ eggs, and he goes and puts them down in the study, and takes down his books with a sigh, thinking he has done something horribly wrong, whereas he has learnt on in advance much more than will be done at second lesson.",old humbug upbraid one learn lesson floor first lesson mean say take poor little joy pride first bird egg go put study take book sigh think do wrong learn advance more do second lesson 
16,"But the old Madman hasn’t, and gets called up, and makes some frightful shots, losing about ten places, and all but getting floored. This somewhat appeases Tom’s wrath, and by the end of the lesson he has regained his temper. And afterwards in their study he begins to get right again, as he watches Arthur’s intense joy at seeing Martin blowing the eggs and gluing them carefully on to bits of cardboard, and notes the anxious, loving looks which the little fellow casts sidelong at him. And then he thinks, “What an ill-tempered beast I am! Here’s just what I was wishing for last night come about, and I’m spoiling it all,” and in another five minutes has swallowed the last mouthful of his bile, and is repaid by seeing his little sensitive plant expand again and sun itself in his smiles.",old call make frightful shot lose place floor appease wrath end lesson regain temper study begin get watch intense joy see blow egg glue bit cardboard note anxious loving look little fellow cast sidelong think ill temper beast wish last night come spoil minute swallow last mouthful bile repaid see little sensitive plant expand sun smile 
17,"After dinner the Madman is busy with the preparations for their expedition, fitting new straps on to his climbing-irons, filling large pill-boxes with cotton-wool, and sharpening East’s small axe. They carry all their munitions into calling-overs and directly afterwards, having dodged such praepostors as are on the lookout for fags at cricket, the four set off at a smart trot down the Lawford footpath, straight for Caldecott’s Spinney and the hawk’s nest.",dinner busy preparation expedition fitting new strap climb iron fill large pill box cotton wool sharpen small axe carry munition calling over dodg such praepostor lookout fag cricket set smart trot footpath straight hawk nest 
18,"Martin leads the way in high feather; it is quite a new sensation to him, getting companions, and he finds it very pleasant, and means to show them all manner of proofs of his science and skill. Brown and East may be better at cricket and football and games, thinks he, but out in the fields and woods see if I can’t teach them something. He has taken the leadership already, and strides away in front with his climbing-irons strapped under one arm, his pecking-bag under the other, and his pockets and hat full of pill-boxes, cotton-wool, and other etceteras. Each of the others carries a pecking-bag, and East his hatchet.",lead way high feather new sensation get companion find pleasant mean show manner proof science skill good cricket football game think field wood see teach take leadership stride front climb iron strapp arm peck bag other pocket hat full pill box cotton wool other etcetera other carry peck bag east hatchet 
19,"When they had crossed three or four fields without a check, Arthur began to lag; and Tom seeing this shouted to Martin to pull up a bit. “We ain’t out hare-and-hounds. What’s the good of grinding on at this rate?”",cross field check begin le see shout pull bit hare hound good grind rate 
20,"“There’s the Spinney,” said Martin, pulling up on the brow of a slope at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook, and pointing to the top of the opposite slope; “the nest is in one of those high fir-trees at this end. And down by the brook there I know of a sedge-bird’s nest. We’ll go and look at it coming back.”",be say pull brow slope bottom lay brook point top opposite slope nest high fir tree end brook know sedge bird nest go look come 
21,"“Oh, come on, don’t let us stop,” said Arthur, who was getting excited at the sight of the wood. So they broke into a trot again, and were soon across the brook, up the slope, and into the Spinney. Here they advanced as noiselessly as possible, lest keepers or other enemies should be about, and stopped at the foot of a tall fir, at the top of which Martin pointed out with pride the kestrel’s nest, the object of their quest.",come let stop say get excite sight wood break trot brook slope advance possible keeper other enemy stop foot tall fir top point pride kestrel nest object quest

23,"“There, don’t you see?” said East, pointing to a lump of mistletoe in the next tree, which was a beech. He saw that Martin and Tom were busy with the climbing-irons, and couldn’t resist the temptation of hoaxing. Arthur stared and wondered more than ever.",see say point lump mistletoe next tree beech see busy climb iron resist temptation hoax stare wonder more

37,"Martin did not deign to reply to this sally, except by a grunt, as he buckled the last buckle of his climbing-irons, and Arthur looked reproachfully at East without speaking.",de reply sally grunt buckle last buckle climb iron look speak 
38,"But now came the tug of war. It was a very difficult tree to climb until the branches were reached, the first of which was some fourteen feet up, for the trunk was too large at the bottom to be swarmed; in fact, neither of the boys could reach more than half round it with their arms. Martin and Tom, both of whom had irons on, tried it without success at first; the fir bark broke away where they stuck the irons in as soon as they leant any weight on their feet, and the grip of their arms wasn’t enough to keep them up; so, after getting up three or four feet, down they came slithering to the ground, barking their arms and faces. They were furious, and East sat by laughing and shouting at each failure, “Two to one on the old magpie!”",come tug war difficult tree climb branch reach first foot trunk large bottom swarm fact boy reach more half arm have iron try success first fir bark break stick iron lean weight foot grip arm keep get foot come slither ground bark arm face furious sit laugh shouting failure old magpie

41,"“Now then, Madman,” said Tom, “you next.”",say 
42,"“No, I’m lighter than you; you go next.” So Tom got on East’s shoulders, and grasped the tree above, and then Martin scrambled up on to Tom’s shoulders, amidst the totterings and groanings of the pyramid, and, with a spring which sent his supporters howling to the ground, clasped the stem some ten feet up, and remained clinging. For a moment or two they thought he couldn’t get up; but then, holding on with arms and teeth, he worked first one iron then the other firmly into the bark, got another grip with his arms, and in another minute had hold of the lowest branch.",light go get shoulder grasp tree scramble shoulder tottering groaning pyramid spring send supporter howl ground clasp stem foot remain cling moment think get hold arm tooth work first iron other bark get grip arm minute have hold low branch

44,“Isn’t it very dangerous?” said he.,dangerous say

46,"Martin was now amongst the small branches close to the nest, and away dashed the old bird, and soared up above the trees, watching the intruder.",small branch close nest dash old bird soar tree watch intruder

51,"Martin carefully put one egg into each of his boxes and the third into his mouth, the only other place of safety, and came down like a lamplighter. All went well till he was within ten feet of the ground, when, as the trunk enlarged, his hold got less and less firm, and at last down he came with a run, tumbling on to his back on the turf, spluttering and spitting out the remains of the great egg, which had broken by the jar of his fall.",put egg box third mouth only other place safety come lamplighter go foot ground trunk enlarge hold get less less firm last come run tumble back turf splutter spitting remains great egg break jar fall 
52,"“Ugh, ugh! something to drink--ugh! it was addled,” spluttered he, while the wood rang again with the merry laughter of East and Tom.",drink addle splutter wood ring merry laughter 
53,"Then they examined the prizes, gathered up their things, and went off to the brook, where Martin swallowed huge draughts of water to get rid of the taste; and they visited the sedge-bird’s nest, and from thence struck across the country in high glee, beating the hedges and brakes as they went along; and Arthur at last, to his intense delight, was allowed to climb a small hedgerow oak for a magpie’s nest with Tom, who kept all round him like a mother, and showed him where to hold and how to throw his weight; and though he was in a great fright, didn’t show it, and was applauded by all for his lissomness.",examine prize gather thing go brook swallow huge draught water get rid taste visit sedge bird nest thence strike country high glee beat hedge brake go last intense delight allow climb small hedgerow oak magpie nest keep mother show hold throw weight great fright show applaud lissomness

56,"No one objected, so each boy filled the fustian bag he carried full of stones. They crossed into the next field, Tom and East taking one side of the hedges, and the other two the other side. Noise enough they made certainly, but it was too early in the season for the young birds, and the old birds were too strong on the wing for our young marksmen, and flew out of shot after the first discharge. But it was great fun, rushing along the hedgerows, and discharging stone after stone at blackbirds and chaffinches, though no result in the shape of slaughtered birds was obtained; and Arthur soon entered into it, and rushed to head back the birds, and shouted, and threw, and tumbled into ditches, and over and through hedges, as wild as the Madman himself.",object boy fill fustian bag carry full stone cross next field take side hedge other other side noise make early season young bird old bird strong wing young marksmen fly shot first discharge great fun rush hedgerow discharg stone stone blackbird chaffinch result shape slaughter bird obtain enter rush head bird shout throw tumble ditch hedge wild 
57,"Presently the party, in full cry after an old blackbird (who was evidently used to the thing and enjoyed the fun, for he would wait till they came close to him, and then fly on for forty yards or so, and, with an impudent flicker of his tail, dart into the depths of the quickset), came beating down a high double hedge, two on each side.",party full cry old blackbird use thing enjoy fun wait come fly yard impudent flicker tail dart depth quickset come beat high double hedge side 
58,"“There he is again,” “Head him,” “Let drive,” “I had him there,” “Take care where you’re throwing, Madman.” The shouts might have been heard a quarter of a mile off. They were heard some two hundred yards off by a farmer and two of his shepherds, who were doctoring sheep in a fold in the next field.",head let drive have take care throw shout hear quarter mile hear yard farmer shepherd doctor sheep fold next field 
59,"Now, the farmer in question rented a house and yard situate at the end of the field in which the young bird-fanciers had arrived, which house and yard he didn’t occupy or keep any one else in. Nevertheless, like a brainless and unreasoning Briton, he persisted in maintaining on the premises a large stock of cocks, hens, and other poultry. Of course, all sorts of depredators visited the place from time to time: foxes and gipsies wrought havoc in the night; while in the daytime, I regret to have to confess that visits from the Rugby boys, and consequent disappearances of ancient and respectable fowls were not unfrequent. Tom and East had during the period of their outlawry visited the farm in question for felonious purposes, and on one occasion had conquered and slain a duck there, and borne away the carcass triumphantly, hidden in their handkerchiefs. However, they were sickened of the practice by the trouble and anxiety which the wretched duck’s body caused them. They carried it to Sally Harrowell’s, in hopes of a good supper; but she, after examining it, made a long face, and refused to dress or have anything to do with it. Then they took it into their study, and began plucking it themselves; but what to do with the feathers, where to hide them?",farmer question rent house yard situate end field young bird fancier arrive house yard occupy keep one brainless unreasoning persist maintain premise large stock cock hen other poultry course sort depredator visit place time time fox gipsie wring havoc night daytime regret have confess visit boy consequent disappearance ancient respectable fowl unfrequent have period outlawry visit farm question felonious purpose occasion conquer slain duck borne carcass hide handkerchief sicken practice trouble anxiety wretch duck body cause carry hope good supper examine make long face refuse dress have do take study begin pluck do feather hide 
60,"“Good gracious, Tom, what a lot of feathers a duck has!” groaned East, holding a bagful in his hand, and looking disconsolately at the carcass, not yet half plucked.",good gracious lot feather duck have groan hold bagful hand look carcass half pluck 
61,"“And I do think he’s getting high, too, already,” said Tom, smelling at him cautiously, “so we must finish him up soon.”",think get high say smell finish 
62,"“Yes, all very well; but how are we to cook him? I’m sure I ain’t going to try it on in the hall or passages; we can’t afford to be roasting ducks about--our character’s too bad.”",cook sure go try hall passage afford roast duck character bad 
63,"“I wish we were rid of the brute,” said Tom, throwing him on the table in disgust. And after a day or two more it became clear that got rid of he must be; so they packed him and sealed him up in brown paper, and put him in the cupboard of an unoccupied study, where he was found in the holidays by the matron, a gruesome body.",wish rid brute say throw table disgust day more become clear get rid pack seal brown paper put cupboard unoccupied study find holiday matron gruesome body 
64,"They had never been duck-hunting there since, but others had, and the bold yeoman was very sore on the subject, and bent on making an example of the first boys he could catch. So he and his shepherds crouched behind the hurdles, and watched the party, who were approaching all unconscious. Why should that old guinea-fowl be lying out in the hedge just at this particular moment of all the year? Who can say? Guinea-fowls always are; so are all other things, animals, and persons, requisite for getting one into scrapes--always ready when any mischief can come of them. At any rate, just under East’s nose popped out the old guinea-hen, scuttling along and shrieking, “Come back, come back,”  at the top of her voice. Either of the other three might perhaps have withstood the temptation, but East first lets drive the stone he has in his hand at her, and then rushes to turn her into the hedge again. He succeeds, and then they are all at it for dear life, up and down the hedge in full cry, the “Come back, come back,” getting shriller and fainter every minute.",duck hunting other bold yeoman sore subject bend make example first boy catch shepherd crouch hurdle watch party approach unconscious old guinea fowl lie hedge particular moment year say guinea fowl other thing animal person requisite get scrape ready mischief come rate nose pop old guinea hen scuttle shriek come come top voice other withstood temptation let drive stone have hand rush turn hedge succeed dear life hedge full cry come come get shriller fainter minute 
65,"Meantime, the farmer and his men steal over the hurdles and creep down the hedge towards the scene of action. They are almost within a stone’s throw of Martin, who is pressing the unlucky chase hard, when Tom catches sight of them, and sings out, “Louts, ‘ware louts, your side! Madman, look ahead!” and then catching hold of Arthur, hurries him away across the field towards Rugby as hard as they can tear. Had he been by himself, he would have stayed to see it out with the others, but now his heart sinks and all his pluck goes. The idea of being led up to the Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls quite unmans and takes half the run out of him.",farmer man steal hurdle creep hedge scene action stone throw press unlucky chase catch sight sing lout ware lout side look catching hold hurry field tear stay see other heart sink pluck go idea lead bagg fowl unman take run 
66,"However, no boys are more able to take care of themselves than East and Martin; they dodge the pursuers, slip through a gap, and come pelting after Tom and Arthur, whom they catch up in no time. The farmer and his men are making good running about a field behind. Tom wishes to himself that they had made off in any other direction, but now they are all in for it together, and must see it out.",boy able take care dodge pursuer slip gap come pelt catch time farmer man make good running field wish make other direction see 
67,"“You won’t leave the young un, will you?” says he, as they haul poor little Arthur, already losing wind from the fright, through the next hedge. “Not we,” is the answer from both. The next hedge is a stiff one; the pursuers gain horribly on them, and they only just pull Arthur through, with two great rents in his trousers, as the foremost shepherd comes up on the other side. As they start into the next field, they are aware of two figures walking down the footpath in the middle of it, and recognize Holmes and Diggs taking a constitutional. Those good-natured fellows immediately shout, “On.” “Let’s go to them and surrender,”  pants Tom. Agreed. And in another minute the four boys, to the great astonishment of those worthies, rush breathless up to Holmes and Diggs, who pull up to see what is the matter; and then the whole is explained by the appearance of the farmer and his men, who unite their forces and bear down on the knot of boys.",leave young un say haul poor little lose wind fright next hedge answer next hedge stiff one pursuer gain pull great rent trousers foremost shepherd come other side start next field aware figure walk footpath middle recognize take constitutional good natured fellow shout let go surrender pants agree minute boy great astonishment worthie rush breathless pull see matter whole explain appearance farmer man unite force bear knot boy

71,"“I’ve got the young varmint at last, have I,” pants the farmer; “why, they’ve been a-skulking about my yard and stealing my fowls--that’s where ‘tis; and if I doan’t have they flogged for it, every one on ‘em, my name ain’t Thompson.”",get young varmint last pants farmer skulk yard steal fowl flogge one name

You deserve to have it all stolen. So if you choose to come up to the Doctor with them, I shall go with you, and tell him what I think of it.”",mind farmer answer tell ashamed leave poultry watch deserve have steal choose come doctor go tell think 
85,"The farmer began to take Holmes for a master; besides, he wanted to get back to his flock. Corporal punishment was out of the question, the odds were too great; so he began to hint at paying for the damage. Arthur jumped at this, offering to pay anything, and the farmer immediately valued the guinea-hen at half a sovereign.",farmer begin take master want get flock corporal punishment question odd great begin hint pay damage jump offer pay farmer value guinea hen sovereign 
86,"“Half a sovereign!” cried East, now released from the farmer’s grip; “well, that is a good one!

87,"It was at last settled that they should pay the farmer two shillings, and his man one shilling; and so the matter ended, to the unspeakable relief of Tom, who hadn’t been able to say a word, being sick at heart at the idea of what the Doctor would think of him; and now the whole party of boys marched off down the footpath towards Rugby. Holmes, who was one of the best boys in the School, began to improve the occasion. “Now, you youngsters,” said he, as he marched along in the middle of them, “mind this; you’re very well out of this scrape. Don’t you go near Thompson’s barn again; do you hear?”",last settle pay farmer shilling man shilling matter end unspeakable relief able say word sick heart idea think whole party boy march footpath good boy begin improve occasion youngster say march middle mind scrape go barn hear

Now, knocking over other people’s chickens, and running off with them, is stealing. It’s a nasty word, but that’s the plain English of it. If the chickens were dead and lying in a shop, you wouldn’t take them, I know that, any more than you would apples out of Griffith’s basket; but there’s no real difference between chickens running about and apples on a tree, and the same articles in a shop. I wish our morals were sounder in such matters.
