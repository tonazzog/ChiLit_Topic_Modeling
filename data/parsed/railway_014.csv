1,CHAPTER XIV. The End.,end 
2," Life at the Three Chimneys was never quite the same again after the old gentleman came to see his grandson. Although they now knew his name, the children never spoke of him by it--at any rate, when they were by themselves. To them he was always the old gentleman, and I think he had better be the old gentleman to us, too. It wouldn’t make him seem any more real to you, would it, if I were to tell you that his name was Snooks or Jenkins (which it wasn’t)?--and, after all, I must be allowed to keep one secret. It’s the only one; I have told you everything else, except what I am going to tell you in this chapter, which is the last. At least, of course, I haven’t told you EVERYTHING. If I were to do that, the book would never come to an end, and that would be a pity, wouldn’t it?",life same old gentleman come see grandson know name child speak rate old gentleman think old gentleman make seem real tell name allow keep secret only one tell else go tell chapter last least course tell do book come end pity 
3,"Well, as I was saying, life at Three Chimneys was never quite the same again. The cook and the housemaid were very nice (I don’t mind telling you their names--they were Clara and Ethelwyn), but they told Mother they did not seem to want Mrs. Viney, and that she was an old muddler. So Mrs. Viney came only two days a week to do washing and ironing. Then Clara and Ethelwyn said they could do the work all right if they weren’t interfered with, and that meant that the children no longer got the tea and cleared it away and washed up the tea-things and dusted the rooms.",say life same cook housemaid nice mind tell name tell mother seem want old muddler come day week do washing ironing say do work interfer mean child get tea clear wash tea thing dust room 
4,"This would have left quite a blank in their lives, although they had often pretended to themselves and to each other that they hated housework. But now that Mother had no writing and no housework to do, she had time for lessons. And lessons the children had to do. However nice the person who is teaching you may be, lessons are lessons all the world over, and at their best are worse fun than peeling potatoes or lighting a fire.",leave blank life pretend other hate housework mother have writing housework do have time lesson lesson child have do nice person teach lesson lesson world good bad fun peel potato light fire 
5,"On the other hand, if Mother now had time for lessons, she also had time for play, and to make up little rhymes for the children as she used to do. She had not had much time for rhymes since she came to Three Chimneys.",other hand have time lesson have time play make little rhyme child use do have much time rhyme come 
6,"There was one very odd thing about these lessons. Whatever the children were doing, they always wanted to be doing something else. When Peter was doing his Latin, he thought it would be nice to be learning History like Bobbie. Bobbie would have preferred Arithmetic, which was what Phyllis happened to be doing, and Phyllis of course thought Latin much the most interesting kind of lesson. And so on.",be odd thing lesson child do want do else do think nice learn history prefer happen do course think interesting kind lesson 
7,"So, one day, when they sat down to lessons, each of them found a little rhyme at its place. I put the rhymes in to show you that their Mother really did understand a little how children feel about things, and also the kind of words they use, which is the case with very few grown-up people. I suppose most grown-ups have very bad memories, and have forgotten how they felt when they were little. Of course, the verses are supposed to be spoken by the children.",day sit lesson find little rhyme place put rhyme show mother understand little child feel thing kind word use case few grow person suppose grow up have bad memory forget feel little course verse suppose speak child

11,"     The worst of all my lesson things        Is learning who succeeded who      In all the rows of queens and kings,        With dates to everything they do:      With dates enough to make you sick;--      I wish it was Arithmetic!",bad lesson thing learn succeed row queen king date do date make sick wish arithmetic

I’d break the slate and scream for joy      If I did Latin like a boy!,such pound pound apple fill slate price spend scratch figure cry dividend break slate scream joy do boy 
14,"This kind of thing, of course, made lessons much jollier. It is something to know that the person who is teaching you sees that it is not all plain sailing for you, and does not think that it is just your stupidness that makes you not know your lessons till you’ve learned them!",kind thing course make lesson jolly know person teach see plain sailing think stupidness make know lesson learn 
15,"Then as Jim’s leg got better it was very pleasant to go up and sit with him and hear tales about his school life and the other boys. There was one boy, named Parr, of whom Jim seemed to have formed the lowest possible opinion, and another boy named Wigsby Minor, for whose views Jim had a great respect. Also there were three brothers named Paley, and the youngest was called Paley Terts, and was much given to fighting.",leg get good pleasant go sit hear tale school life other boy be boy name seem form low possible opinion boy name view have great respect be brother name young call give fighting 
16,"Peter drank in all this with deep joy, and Mother seemed to have listened with some interest, for one day she gave Jim a sheet of paper on which she had written a rhyme about Parr, bringing in Paley and Wigsby by name in a most wonderful way, as well as all the reasons Jim had for not liking Parr, and Wigsby’s wise opinion on the matter. Jim was immensely pleased. He had never had a rhyme written expressly for him before. He read it till he knew it by heart and then he sent it to Wigsby, who liked it almost as much as Jim did. Perhaps you may like it, too.",drink deep joy seem listen interest day give sheet paper write rhyme bring name wonderful way reason have like wise opinion matter pleased have rhyme write read know heart send like much like

24,"Jim could never understand how Mother could have been clever enough to do it. To the others it seemed nice, but natural. You see they had always been used to having a mother who could write verses just like the way people talk, even to the shocking expression at the end of the rhyme, which was Jim’s very own.",understand mother clever do other seem nice natural see use have mother write verse way person talk shocking expression end rhyme own 
25,"Jim taught Peter to play chess and draughts and dominoes, and altogether it was a nice quiet time.",teach play chess draught dominoe nice quiet time

But it was extraordinarily difficult to think of anything.",leg get good good general feeling begin spring do amuse game handsome difficult think 
27,"“It’s no good,” said Peter, when all of them had thought and thought till their heads felt quite heavy and swollen; “if we can’t think of anything to amuse him, we just can’t, and there’s an end of it. Perhaps something will just happen of its own accord that he’ll like.”",good say think think head feel heavy swollen think amuse be end happen own accord like

29,"“I wish something would happen,” said Bobbie, dreamily, “something wonderful.”",wish happen say wonderful 
30,"And something wonderful did happen exactly four days after she had said this. I wish I could say it was three days after, because in fairy tales it is always three days after that things happen. But this is not a fairy story, and besides, it really was four and not three, and I am nothing if not strictly truthful.",wonderful happen day say wish say day fairy tale day thing happen fairy story truthful 
31,"They seemed to be hardly Railway children at all in those days, and as the days went on each had an uneasy feeling about this which Phyllis expressed one day.",seem railway child day day go have uneasy feeling express day

37,"“Let’s begin again,” said Phyllis. And they did.",let begin say 
38,"Somehow the change of everything that was made by having servants in the house and Mother not doing any writing, made the time seem extremely long since that strange morning at the beginning of things, when they had got up so early and burnt the bottom out of the kettle and had apple pie for breakfast and first seen the Railway.",change make have servant house mother do writing make time seem strange morning beginning thing get burn bottom kettle have apple pie breakfast see 
39,"It was September now, and the turf on the slope to the Railway was dry and crisp. Little long grass spikes stood up like bits of gold wire, frail blue harebells trembled on their tough, slender stalks, Gipsy roses opened wide and flat their lilac-coloured discs, and the golden stars of St. John’s Wort shone at the edges of the pool that lay halfway to the Railway. Bobbie gathered a generous handful of the flowers and thought how pretty they would look lying on the green-and-pink blanket of silk-waste that now covered Jim’s poor broken leg.",turf slope dry crisp little long grass spike stand bit gold wire frail blue harebell tremble tough slender stalk rose open wide flat lilac coloured disc golden star shine edge pool lay gather generous handful flower think pretty look lie green pink blanket silk waste cover poor break leg

42,"“When you’re married,” said Peter, “your bootlace will come undone going up the church aisle, and your man that you’re going to get married to will tumble over it and smash his nose in on the ornamented pavement; and then you’ll say you won’t marry him, and you’ll have to be an old maid.”",married say bootlace come undone go church aisle man go marry tumble smash nose ornament pavement say marry have old maid

45,“Bother the flowers at the wedding!” cried Peter. “Look! the signal’s down. We must run!”,bother flower wedding cry look signal run

47,"“Take our love to Father!” cried Bobbie. And the others, too, shouted:--",take love father cry other shout 
48,“Take our love to Father!”,take love father 
49,"The old gentleman waved from his first-class carriage window. Quite violently he waved. And there was nothing odd in that, for he always had waved. But what was really remarkable was that from every window handkerchiefs fluttered, newspapers signalled, hands waved wildly. The train swept by with a rustle and roar, the little pebbles jumped and danced under it as it passed, and the children were left looking at each other.",old gentleman wave first class carriage window wave be odd wave remarkable window handkerchief flutter newspaper signall hand wave train sweep rustle roar little pebble jump dance pass child leave look other

55,"Now, curiously enough, this was just what had happened. The old gentleman, who was very well known and respected at his particular station, had got there early that morning, and he had waited at the door where the young man stands holding the interesting machine that clips the tickets, and he had said something to every single passenger who passed through that door. And after nodding to what the old gentleman had said--and the nods expressed every shade of surprise, interest, doubt, cheerful pleasure, and grumpy agreement--each passenger had gone on to the platform and read one certain part of his newspaper. And when the passengers got into the train, they had told the other passengers who were already there what the old gentleman had said, and then the other passengers had also looked at their newspapers and seemed very astonished and, mostly, pleased. Then, when the train passed the fence where the three children were, newspapers and hands and handkerchiefs were waved madly, till all that side of the train was fluttery with white like the pictures of the King’s Coronation in the biograph at Maskelyne and Cook’s. To the children it almost seemed as though the train itself was alive, and was at last responding to the love that they had given it so freely and so long.",happen old gentleman know respect particular station get morning wait door young man stand hold interesting machine clip ticket say single passenger pass door nodd old gentleman say nod express shade surprise interest doubt cheerful pleasure grumpy agreement passenger go platform read certain part newspaper passenger get train tell other passenger old gentleman say other passenger look newspaper seem astonished pleased train pass fence child newspaper hand handkerchief wave side train fluttery white picture biograph child seem train alive last respond love give

65,"Lessons were more than usually difficult to Bobbie that day. Indeed, she disgraced herself so deeply over a quite simple sum about the division of 48 pounds of meat and 36 pounds of bread among 144 hungry children that Mother looked at her anxiously.",lesson more difficult day disgrace simple sum division pound meat pound bread hungry child mother look 
66,"“Don’t you feel quite well, dear?” she asked.",feel dear ask 
67,"“I don’t know,” was Bobbie’s unexpected answer. “I don’t know how I feel. It isn’t that I’m lazy. Mother, will you let me off lessons to-day? I feel as if I wanted to be quite alone by myself.”",know unexpected answer know feel lazy mother let lesson day feel want alone 
68,"“Yes, of course I’ll let you off,” said Mother; “but--”",course let say mother 
69,"Bobbie dropped her slate. It cracked just across the little green mark that is so useful for drawing patterns round, and it was never the same slate again. Without waiting to pick it up she bolted.

74,"But she could not stay in the garden. The hollyhocks and the asters and the late roses all seemed to be waiting for something to happen.

81,"The blacksmith, coming along with an open newspaper in his hand, was even more strange in his manner. He grinned broadly, though, as a rule, he was a man not given to smiles, and waved the newspaper long before he came up to her. And as he passed her, he said, in answer to her “Good morning”:--",blacksmith come open newspaper hand strange manner grin rule man give smile wave newspaper come pass say answer good morning

I see it in the paper, and I don’t think I was ever so glad of anything in all my born days!” He looked at Bobbie a moment, then said, “One I must have, Miss, and no offence, I know, on a day like this ‘ere!” and with that he kissed her, first on one cheek and then on the other.",say train smart work bless dear see paper think glad bear day look moment say offence know day kiss cheek other

95,"Of course you know already exactly what was going to happen. Bobbie was not so clever. She had the vague, confused, expectant feeling that comes to one’s heart in dreams. What her heart expected I can’t tell--perhaps the very thing that you and I know was going to happen--but her mind expected nothing; it was almost blank, and felt nothing but tiredness and stupidness and an empty feeling, like your body has when you have been a long walk and it is very far indeed past your proper dinner-time.",course know go happen clever have vague confused expectant feeling come heart dream heart expect tell very thing know go happen mind expect blank feel tiredness stupidness empty feeling body have long walk proper dinner time

He is looking at the flowers, and each flower is a miracle to eyes that all these months of Spring and Summer have seen only flagstones and gravel and a little grudging grass. But his eyes keep turning towards the house. And presently he leaves the garden and goes to stand outside the nearest door. It is the back door, and across the yard the swallows are circling.
