2," Once outside in the open air, the Jinnee ""towered"" like a pheasant shot through the breast, and Horace closed his eyes with a combined swing-switchback-and-Channel-passage sensation during a flight which apparently continued for hours, although in reality it probably did not occupy more than a very few seconds. His uneasiness was still further increased by his inability to guess where he was being taken to--for he felt instinctively that they were not travelling in the direction of home.",open air tower pheasant shot breast close eye combine swing switchback passage sensation flight continue hour reality occupy more few second uneasiness increase inability guess take feel travel direction home 
3,"At last he felt himself set down on some hard, firm surface, and ventured to open his eyes once more. When he realised where he actually was, his knees gave way under him, and he was seized with a sudden giddiness that very nearly made him lose his balance. For he found himself standing on a sort of narrow ledge or cornice immediately under the ball at the top of St. Paul's.",last feel set hard firm surface venture open eye more realise knee give way seize sudden giddiness make lose balance find stand sort narrow ledge cornice ball top 
4,"Many feet beneath him spread the dull, leaden summit of the dome, its raised ridges stretching, like huge serpents over the curve, beyond which was a glimpse of the green roof of the nave and the two west towers, with their grey columns and urn-topped buttresses and gilded pineapples, which shone ruddily in the sun.",many foot spread dull leaden summit dome raise ridge stretch huge serpent curve glimpse green roof nave west tower grey column urn -toppe buttress gilded pineapple shine sun 
5,"He had an impression of Ludgate Hill and Fleet Street as a deep, winding ravine, steeped in partial shadow; of long sierras of roofs and chimney-pots, showing their sharp outlines above mouse-coloured smoke-wreaths; of the broad, pearl-tinted river, with oily ripples and a golden glitter where the sunlight touched it; of the gleaming slope of mud under the wharves and warehouses on the Surrey side; of barges and steamers moored in black clusters; of a small tug fussing noisily down the river, leaving a broadening arrow-head in its wake.",have impression deep wind ravine steep partial shadow long sierra roof chimney pot show sharp outline mouse coloured smoke wreath broad pearl tint river oily ripple golden glitter sunlight touch gleam slope mud wharve warehouse side barge steamer moor black cluster small tug fuss river leave broaden arrow head wake 
6,"Cautiously he moved round towards the east, where the houses formed a blurred mosaic of cream, slate, indigo, and dull reds and browns, above which slender rose-flushed spires and towers pierced the haze, stained in countless places by pillars of black, grey, and amber smoke, and lightened by plumes and jets of silvery steam, till all blended by imperceptible gradations into a sky of tenderest gold slashed with translucent blue.",move east house form blur mosaic cream slate indigo dull red brown slender rose flush spire tower pierce haze stain countless place pillar black grey amber smoke lighten plume jet silvery steam blend imperceptible gradation sky tenderest gold slash translucent blue 
7,"It was a magnificent view, and none the less so because the indistinctness of all beyond a limited radius made the huge City seem not only mystical, but absolutely boundless in extent. But although Ventimore was distinctly conscious of all this, he was scarcely in a state to appreciate its grandeur just then. He was much too concerned with wondering why Fakrash had chosen to plant him up there in so insecure a position, and how he was ever to be rescued from it, since the Jinnee had apparently disappeared.",magnificent view less indistinctness limited radius make huge seem mystical boundless extent conscious state appreciate grandeur concerned wonder choose plant insecure position rescue disappear 
8,"He was not far off, however, for presently Horace saw him stalk round the narrow cornice with an air of being perfectly at home on it.",see stalk narrow cornice air home 
9,"""So there you are!"" said Ventimore; ""I thought you'd deserted me again. What have you brought me up here for?""",say think desert bring 
10,"""Because I desired to have speech with thee in private,"" replied the Jinnee.",desire have speech private reply 
11,"""We're not likely to be intruded on here, certainly,"" said Horace. ""But isn't it rather exposed, rather public? If we're seen up here, you know, it will cause a decided sensation.""",likely intrude say expose public see know cause decide sensation 
12,"""I have laid a spell on all below that they should not raise their eyes. Be seated, therefore, and hear my words.""",lay spell raise eye seat hear word 
13,"Horace lowered himself carefully to a sitting position, so that his legs dangled in space, and Fakrash took a seat by his side. ""O, most indiscreet of mankind!"" he began, in an aggrieved tone; ""thou hast been near the committal of a great blunder, and doing ill to thyself and to me!""",lower sitting position leg dangle space take seat side indiscreet mankind begin aggrieved tone committal great blunder do ill 
14,"""Well, I _do_ like that!"" retorted Horace; ""when you let me in for all that freedom of the City business, and then sneaked off, leaving me to get out of it the best way I could, and only came back just as I was about to explain matters, and carried me up through the roof like a sack of flour. Do you consider that tactful on your part?""",retort let freedom business sneak leave get good way come about explain matter carry roof sack flour consider tactful part 
15,"""Thou hadst drunk wine and permitted it to creep as far as the place of secrets.""",hadst drunk wine permit creep place secret 
16,"""Only one glass,"" said Horace; ""and I wanted it, I can assure you. I was obliged to make a speech to them, and, thanks to you, I was in such a hole that I saw nothing for it but to tell the truth.""",glass say want assure oblige make speech thanks hole see tell truth 
17,"""Veracity, as thou wilt learn,"" answered the Jinnee, ""is not invariably the Ship of Safety. Thou wert about to betray the benefactor who procured for thee such glory and honour as might well cause the gall-bladder of lions to burst with envy!""",veracity learn answer betray benefactor procure such glory honour cause gall bladder lion burst envy 
18,"""If any lion with the least sense of humour could have witnessed the proceedings,"" said Ventimore, ""he might have burst with laughter--certainly not envy. Good Lord! Fakrash,"" he cried, in his indignation, ""I've never felt such an absolute ass in my whole life! If nothing would satisfy you but my receiving the freedom of the City, you might at least have contrived some decent excuse for it! But you left out the only point there was in the whole thing--and all for what?""",lion least sense humour witness proceedings say burst laughter envy good lord cry indignation feel absolute ass whole life satisfy receive freedom least contrive decent excuse leave only point whole thing 
19,"""What doth it signify why the whole populace should come forth to acclaim thee and do thee honour, so long as they did so?"" said Fakrash, sullenly. ""For the report of thy fame would reach Bedeea-el-Jemal.""",signify whole populace come acclaim do honour do say report fame reach 
20,"""That's just where you're mistaken,"" said Horace. ""If you had not been in too desperate a hurry to make a few inquiries, you would have found out that you were taking all this trouble for nothing.""",mistaken say desperate hurry make few inquiry find take trouble 
21,"""How sayest thou?""",sayest 
22,"""Well, you would have discovered that the Princess is spared all temptation to marry beneath her by the fact that she became the bride of somebody else about thirty centuries ago. She married a mortal, one Seyf-el-Mulook, a King's son, and they've both been dead a considerable time--another obstacle to your plans.""",discover spare temptation marry fact become bride else century marry mortal son dead considerable time obstacle plan 
23,"""It is a lie,"" declared Fakrash.",lie declare 
24,"""If you will take me back to Vincent Square, I shall be happy to show you the evidence in your national records,"" said Horace. ""And you may be glad to know that your old enemy, Mr. Jarjarees, came to a violent end, after a very sporting encounter with a King's daughter, who, though proficient in advanced magic, unfortunately perished herself, poor lady, in the final round.""",take happy show evidence national record say glad know old enemy come violent end sport encounter daughter proficient advanced magic perish poor lady final round 
25,"""I had intended _thee_ to accomplish his downfall,"" said Fakrash.",intend _thee_ accomplish downfall say 
26,"""I know,"" said Horace. ""It was most thoughtful of you. But I doubt if I should have done it half as well--and it would have probably cost me an eye, at the very least. It's better as it is.""",know say thoughtful doubt do half cost eye very least good 
27,"""And how long hast thou known of these things?""",know thing 
28,"""Only since last night.""",last night

30,"""I've had such a busy morning, you see,"" explained Horace. ""There's been no time.""",have busy morning see explain be time 
31,"""Silly-bearded fool that I was to bring this misbegotten dog into the august presence of the great Lord Mayor himself (on whom be peace!),"" cried the Jinnee.",silly bearded fool bring misbegotten dog august presence great peace cry 
32,"""I object to being referred to as a misbegotten dog,"" said Horace, ""but with the rest of your remark I entirely concur. I'm afraid the Lord Mayor is very far from being at peace just now."" He pointed to the steep roof of the Guildhall, with its dormers and fretted pinnacles, and the slender lantern through which he had so lately made his inglorious exit. ""There's the devil of a row going on under that lantern just now, Mr. Fakrash, you may depend upon that. They've locked the doors till they can decide what to do next--which will take them some time. And it's all your fault!""",object refer misbegotten dog say rest remark concur afraid peace point steep roof dormer fret pinnacle slender lantern make inglorious exit be devil row go lantern depend lock door decide do take time fault 
33,"""It was thy doing. Why didst thou dare to inform the Lord Mayor that he was deceived?""",do dare inform deceive 
34,"""Why? Because I thought he ought to know. Because I was bound, particularly after my oath of allegiance, to warn him of any conspiracy against him. Because I was in such a hat. He'll understand all that--he won't blame _me_ for this business.""",think know bind oath allegiance warn conspiracy hat understand blame _me_ business 
35,"""It is fortunate,"" observed the Jinnee, ""that I flew away with thee before thou couldst pronounce my name.""",fortunate observe fly pronounce name 
36,"""You gave yourself away,"" said Horace. ""They all saw you, you know. You weren't flying so particularly fast. They'll recognise you again. If you _will_ carry off a man from under the Lord Mayor's very nose, and shoot up through the roof like a rocket with him, you can't expect to escape some notice. You see, you happen to be the only unbottled Jinnee in this City.""",give say see know fly recognise carry man very nose shoot roof rocket expect escape notice see happen only unbottle 
37,"Fakrash shifted his seat on the cornice. ""I have committed no act of disrespect unto the Lord Mayor,"" he said, ""therefore he can have no just cause of anger against me.""",shift seat cornice commit act disrespect say have cause anger 
38,"Horace perceived that the Jinnee was not altogether at ease, and pushed his advantage accordingly.",perceive ease push advantage 
39,"""My dear good old friend,"" he said, ""you don't seem to realise yet what an awful thing you've done. For your own mistaken purposes, you have compelled the Chief Magistrate and the Corporation of the greatest City in the world to make themselves hopelessly ridiculous. They'll never hear the last of this affair. Just look at the crowds waiting patiently below there. Look at the flags. Think of that gorgeous conveyance of yours standing outside the Guildhall. Think of the assembly inside--all the most aristocratic, noble, and distinguished personages in the land,"" continued Horace, piling it on as he proceeded; ""all collected for what? To be made fools of by a Jinnee out of a brass bottle!""",dear good old friend say seem realise awful thing do own mistaken purpose compel chief great world make ridiculous hear last affair look crowd wait look flag think gorgeous conveyance stand think assembly aristocratic noble distinguished personage land continue pile proceed collect make fool brass bottle 
40,"""For their own sakes they will preserve silence,"" said Fakrash, with a gleam of unwonted shrewdness.",own sake preserve silence say gleam unwonted shrewdness 
41,"""Probably they would hush it up, if they only could,"" conceded Horace. ""But how _can_ they? What are they to say? What plausible explanation can they give? Besides, there's the Press: you don't know what the Press is; but I assure you its power is tremendous--it's simply impossible to keep anything secret from it nowadays. It has eyes and ears everywhere, and a thousand tongues. Five minutes after the doors in that hall are unlocked (and they can't keep them locked _much_ longer) the reporters will be handing in their special descriptions of you and your latest vagaries to their respective journals. Within half an hour bills will be carried through every quarter of London--bills with enormous letters: 'Extraordinary Scene at the Guildhall.' 'Strange End to a Civic Function.' 'Startling Appearance of an Oriental Genie in the City.' 'Abduction of a Guest of the Lord Mayor.' 'Intense Excitement.' 'Full Particulars!' And by that time the story will have flashed round the whole world. 'Keep silence,' indeed! Do you imagine for a moment that the Lord Mayor, or anybody else concerned, however remotely, will ever forget, or be allowed to forget, such an outrageous incident as this? If you do, believe me, you're mistaken.""",hush concede say plausible explanation give be know assure power tremendous impossible keep secret have eye ear tongue minute door hall unlock keep lock reporter hand special description late vagary respective journal hour bill carry quarter bill enormous letter extraordinary scene strange civic startling oriental intense full particular time story flash whole world keep silence imagine moment else concerned forget allow forget outrageous incident believe mistaken

43,"""Awful!"" said Horace. ""But you seem to have managed it.""",awful say seem manage 
44,"""He weareth round his neck a magic jewel, which giveth him dominion over devils--is it not so?""",weareth neck magic jewel giveth dominion devil 
45,"""You know best,"" said Horace.",know good say 
46,"""It was the splendour of that jewel and the majesty of his countenance that rendered me afraid to enter his presence, lest he should recognise me for what I am and command me to obey him, for verily his might is greater even than Suleyman's, and his hand heavier upon such of the Jinn as fall into his power!""",splendour jewel majesty countenance render afraid enter presence recognise command obey great hand heavy such fall power 
47,"""If that's so,"" said Horace, ""I should strongly advise you to find some way of putting things straight before it's too late--you've no time to lose.""",say advise find way put thing late have time lose 
48,"""Thou sayest well,"" said Fakrash, springing to his feet, and turning his face towards Cheapside. Horace shuffled himself along the ledge in a seated position after the Jinnee, and, looking down between his feet, could just see the tops of the thin and rusty trees in the churchyard, the black and serried swarms of foreshortened people in the street, and the scarlet-rimmed mouths of chimney-pots on the tiled roofs below.",say spring foot turn face shuffle ledge seat position look foot see top thin rusty tree churchyard black serry swarm foreshorten person street scarlet rimm mouth chimney pot tile roof 
49,"""There is but one remedy I know,"" said the Jinnee, ""and it may be that I have lost power to perform it. Yet will I make the endeavour."" And, stretching forth his right hand towards the east, he muttered some kind of command or invocation.",be remedy know say lose power perform make endeavour stretch right hand east mutter kind command invocation 
50,"Horace almost fell off the cornice with apprehension of what might follow. Would it be a thunderbolt, a plague, some frightful convulsion of Nature? He felt sure that Fakrash would hesitate at no means, however violent, of burying all traces of his blunder in oblivion, and very little hope that, whatever he did, it would prove anything but some worse indiscretion than his previous performances.",fall cornice apprehension follow thunderbolt plague frightful convulsion feel sure hesitate means violent bury trace blunder oblivion little hope do prove bad indiscretion previous performance 
51,"Happily none of these extreme measures seemed to have occurred to the Jinnee, though what followed was strange and striking enough.",extreme measure seem occur follow strange striking 
52,"For presently, as if in obedience to the Jinnee's weird gesticulations, a lurid belt of fog came rolling up from the direction of the Royal Exchange, swallowing up building after building in its rapid course; one by one the Guildhall, Bow Church, Cheapside itself, and the churchyard disappeared, and Horace, turning his head to the left, saw the murky tide sweeping on westward, blotting out Ludgate Hill, the Strand, Charing Cross, and Westminster--till at last he and Fakrash were alone above a limitless plain of bituminous cloud, the only living beings left, as it seemed, in a blank and silent universe.",obedience weird gesticulation lurid belt fog come roll direction royal swallow building build rapid course churchyard disappear turn head left see murky tide sweep blot last alone limitless plain bituminous cloud only living being leave seem blank silent universe 
53,"""Look again!"" said Fakrash, and Horace, looking eastward, saw the spire of Bow Church, rosy once more, the Guildhall standing clear and intact, and the streets and house-tops gradually reappearing. Only the flags, with their unrestful shiver and ripple of colour, had disappeared, and, with them, the waiting crowds and the mounted constables. The ordinary traffic of vans, omnibuses, and cabs was proceeding as though it had never been interrupted--the clank and jingle of harness chains, the cries and whip-crackings of drivers, rose with curious distinctness above the incessant trampling roar which is the ground-swell of the human ocean.",look say look see spire rosy more standing clear intact street house top reappear flag unrestful shiver ripple colour disappear waiting crowd mount constable ordinary traffic van omnibuse cab proceed interrupt clank jingle harness chain cry whip cracking driver rise curious distinctness incessant trampling roar ground swell human ocean

See, they go about their several businesses, and all the past incidents are to them as though they had never been.""",cloud sawest say have sweep memory affair mind mortal assemble do honour see go several business past incident 
55,"It was not often that Horace could honestly commend any performance of the Jinnee's, but at this he could not restrain his admiration. ""By Jove!"" he said, ""that certainly gets the Lord Mayor and everybody else out of the mess as neatly as possible. I must say, Mr. Fakrash, it's much the best thing I've seen you do yet.""",commend performance restrain admiration say get else mess possible say good thing see do 
56,"""Wait,"" said the Jinnee, ""for presently thou shalt see me perform a yet more excellent thing.""",wait say see perform excellent thing 
57,"There was a most unpleasant green glow in his eyes and a bristle in his thin beard as he spoke, which suddenly made Horace feel uncomfortable. He did not like the look of the Jinnee at all.",be unpleasant green glow eye bristle thin beard speak make feel uncomfortable like look 
58,"""I really think you've done enough for to-day,"" he said. ""And this wind up here is rather searching. I shan't be sorry to find myself on the ground again.""",think do day say wind search sorry find ground 
59,"""That,"" replied the Jinnee, ""thou shalt assuredly do before long, O impudent and deceitful wretch!"" And he laid a long, lean hand on Horace's shoulder.",reply do long impudent deceitful wretch lay long lean hand shoulder 
60,"""He _is_ put out about something!"" thought Ventimore. ""But what?"" ""My dear sir,"" he said aloud, ""I don't understand this tone of yours. What have I done to offend you?""",put think dear sir say understand tone do offend 
61,"""Divinely gifted was he who said: 'Beware of losing hearts in consequence of injury, for the bringing them back after flight is difficult.'""",gift say beware lose heart consequence injury bring flight difficult

63,"""The application,"" explained the Jinnee, ""is that I am determined to cast thee down from here with my own hand!""",application explain determined cast own hand 
64,"Horace turned faint and dizzy for a moment. Then, by a strong effort of will, he pulled himself together. ""Oh, come now,"" he said, ""you don't really mean that, you know. After all your kindness! You're much too good-natured to be capable of anything so atrocious.""",turn faint dizzy moment strong effort will pull come say mean know kindness good natured capable atrocious 
65,"""All pity hath been eradicated from my heart,"" returned Fakrash. ""Therefore prepare to die, for thou art presently about to perish in the most unfortunate manner.""",pity have eradicate heart return prepare die art about perish unfortunate manner 
66,"Ventimore could not repress a shudder. Hitherto he had never been able to take Fakrash quite seriously, in spite of all his supernatural powers; he had treated him with a half-kindly, half-contemptuous tolerance, as a well-meaning, but hopelessly incompetent, old foozle. That the Jinnee should ever become malevolent towards him had never entered his head till now--and yet he undoubtedly had. How was he to cajole and disarm this formidable being? He must keep cool and act promptly, or he would never see Sylvia again.",repress shudder able take spite supernatural power treat half half contemptuous tolerance meaning incompetent old foozle become malevolent enter head have cajole disarm formidable being keep cool act see 
67,"As he sat there on the narrow ledge, with a faint and not unpleasant smell of hops saluting his nostrils from some distant brewery, he tried hard to collect his thoughts, but could not. He found himself, instead, idly watching the busy, jostling crowd below, who were all unconscious of the impending drama so high above them. Just over the rim of the dome he could see the opaque white top of a lamp on a shelter, where a pigmy constable stood, directing the traffic.",sit narrow ledge faint unpleasant smell hop salute nostril distant brewery try collect thought find watch busy jostle crowd unconscious impending drama high rim dome see opaque white top lamp shelter pigmy constable stand direct traffic 
68,"Would he look up if Horace called for help? Even if he could, what help could he render? All he could do would be to keep the crowd back and send for a covered stretcher. No, he would _not_ dwell on these horrors; he _must_ fix his mind on some way of circumventing Fakrash.",look call help help render do keep crowd send cover stretcher dwell horror fix mind way circumvent 
69,"How did the people in ""The Arabian Nights"" manage? The fisherman, for instance? He persuaded _his_ Jinnee to return to the bottle by pretending to doubt whether he had ever really been inside it.",person arabian manage fisherman instance persuade return bottle pretend doubt 
70,"But Fakrash, though simple enough in some respects, was not quite such a fool as that. Sometimes the Jinn could be mollified and induced to grant a reprieve by being told stories, one inside the other, like a nest of Oriental boxes. Unfortunately Fakrash did not seem in the humour for listening to apologues, and, even if he were, Horace could not think of or improvise any just then. ""Besides,"" he thought, ""I can't sit up here telling him anecdotes for ever. I'd almost sooner die!"" Still, he remembered that it was generally possible to draw an Arabian Efreet into discussion: they all loved argument, and had a rough conception of justice.",simple respect fool mollify induce grant reprieve tell story other nest oriental box seem humour listen apologue think improvise think sit tell anecdote die remember possible draw arabian discussion love argument have rough conception justice 
71,"""I think, Mr. Fakrash,"" he said, ""that, in common fairness, I have a right to know what offence I have committed.""",think say common fairness have right know offence commit 
72,"""To recite thy misdeeds,"" replied the Jinnee, ""would occupy much time.""",recite misdeed reply occupy much time 
73,"""I don't mind that,"" said Horace, affably. ""I can give you as long as you like. I'm in no sort of a hurry.""",mind say give like sort hurry 
74,"""With me it is otherwise,"" retorted Fakrash, making a stride towards him. ""Therefore court not life, for thy death hath become unavoidable.'",retort make stride court life death have become unavoidable 
75,"""Before we part,"" said Horace, ""you won't refuse to answer one or two questions?""",part say refuse answer question 
76,"""Didst thou not undertake never to ask any further favour of me? Moreover, it will avail thee nought. For I am positively determined to slay thee.""",undertake ask further favour avail nought determined slay 
77,"""I demand it,"" said Horace, ""in the most great name of the Lord Mayor (on whom be peace!)""",demand say great name peace 
78,It was a desperate shot--but it took effect. The Jinnee quailed visibly.,desperate shot take effect quail 
79,"""Ask, then,"" he said; ""but briefly, for the time groweth short.""",ask say time groweth short 
80,"Horace determined to make one last appeal to Fakrash's sense of gratitude, since it had always seemed the dominant trait in his character.",determine make last appeal sense gratitude seem dominant trait character 
81,"""Well,"" he said, ""but for me, wouldn't you be still in that brass bottle?""",say brass bottle 
82,"""That,"" replied the Jinnee, ""is the very reason why I purpose to destroy thee!""",reply very reason purpose destroy 
83,"""Oh!"" was all Horace could find to say at this most unlooked-for answer. His sheet anchor, in which he had trusted implicitly, had suddenly dragged--and he was drifting fast to destruction.",find say unlooked answer sheet anchor trust drag drift destruction 
84,"""Are there any other questions which thou wouldst ask?"" inquired the Jinnee, with grim indulgence; ""or wilt thou encounter thy doom without further procrastination?""",be other question ask inquire grim indulgence encounter doom further procrastination 
85,"Horace was determined not to give in just yet; he had a very bad hand, but he might as well play the game out and trust to luck to gain a stray trick.",determined give have bad hand play game trust luck gain stray trick
