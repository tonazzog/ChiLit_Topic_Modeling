1,CHAPTER XX. DIAMOND LEARNS TO READ,learn read 
2," THE question of the tall gentleman as to whether Diamond could read or not set his father thinking it was high time he could; and as soon as old Diamond was suppered and bedded, he began the task that very night. But it was not much of a task to Diamond, for his father took for his lesson-book those very rhymes his mother had picked up on the sea-shore; and as Diamond was not beginning too soon, he learned very fast indeed. Within a month he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself.",question tall gentleman read set father think high time old supper bedd begin task night much task father take lesson book rhyme mother pick sea shore begin learn month able spell most verse 
3,"But he had never come upon the poem he thought he had heard his mother read from it that day. He had looked through and through the book several times after he knew the letters and a few words, fancying he could tell the look of it, but had always failed to find one more like it than another. So he wisely gave up the search till he could really read. Then he resolved to begin at the beginning, and read them all straight through. This took him nearly a fortnight. When he had almost reached the end, he came upon the following verses, which took his fancy much, although they were certainly not very like those he was in search of.",come poem think hear mother read day look book several time know letter few word fancy tell look fail find more give search read resolve begin beginning read take fortnight reach end come follow verse take fancy much search
