1,CHAPTER 46.,
2,"The subject was introduced to Mrs Seagrave, while they were at breakfast, and as she perceived how much more secure they would be, she cheerfully consented.  In less than an hour afterwards, William and Ready had prepared the boat, and were pulling out among the rocks of the reef to find a passage, which, after a short time, and by keeping two or three cables from the point, they succeeded in doing.",subject introduce breakfast perceive more secure consent less hour prepare boat pull rock reef find passage short time keep cable point succeed do 
3,"""This is very fortunate, William,"" observed Ready; ""but we must now take some marks to find our way in again.  See, the large black rock is on a line with the garden point: so, if we keep them in one, we shall know that we are in the proper channel; and now for a mark abreast of us, to find out when we enter it.""",fortunate observe ready take mark find way see large black rock line garden point keep know proper channel mark abreast find enter 
4,"""Why, Ready, the corner of the turtle-pond just touches the right wall of the house,"" replied William.",ready corner turtle pond touch right wall house reply 
5,"""So it does; that will do; and now let us pull away as hard as we can, so as to be back in good time.""",do let pull good time 
6,"They soon were on the south side of the island, and pulling up along the shore.",south side island pull shore 
7,"""How far do you think that it is by water, Ready?""",think water ready 
8,"""I hardly know; but at least four or five miles, so we must make up our minds to a good hour's pull.  At all events, we shall sail back again with this wind, although there is but little of it.""",know least mile make mind good hour pull event sail wind be little 
9,"""We are in very deep water now,"" observed William, after a long silence.",deep water observe long silence 
10,"""Yes, on this side of the island we must expect it; the coral grows to leeward only.  I think that we cannot be very far from the little harbour we discovered.  Suppose we leave off rowing for a minute, and look about us.""",side island expect coral grow leeward think little harbour discover suppose leave rowing minute look 
11,"""There are two rocks close to the shore, Ready,"" said William, pointing, ""and you recollect there were two or three rocks outside of the harbour.""",be rock close shore ready say point recollect be rock harbour 
12,"""Very true, William, and I should not wonder if you have hit upon the very spot.  Let us pull in.""",true wonder hit very spot let pull 
13,"They did so; and, to their satisfaction, found that they were in the harbour, where the water was as smooth as a pond.",satisfaction find harbour water smooth pond 
14,"""Now, then, William, we will step the mast, and sail back at our leisure.""",step mast sail leisure 
15,"""Stop one moment, Ready; give me the boat-hook.  I see something between the clefts of the rocks.""",stop moment ready give boat hook see cleft rock 
16,"Ready handed the boat-hook to William, who, lowering it down into the water, drove the spike of iron at the end of it into a large crayfish, which he hauled up into the boat.",ready hand boat hook lower water drive spike iron end large crayfish haul boat 
17,"""That will be an addition to our dinner,"" said Ready; ""we do not go back empty-handed, and, therefore, as the saying is, we shall be more welcome; now, then, let us start, for we must pull here again this afternoon, and with a full cargo on board.""",addition dinner say ready go empty handed saying welcome let start pull afternoon full cargo board 
18,"They stepped the mast, and as soon as they had pulled the boat clear of the harbour, set sail, and in less than an hour had rejoined the party at the house.",step mast pull boat clear harbour set sail less hour rejoin party house 
19,"William had brought up the crayfish, which had only one claw, and Juno put on another pot of water to boil it, as an addition to the dinner, which was nearly ready.  Tommy at first went with his sister Caroline to look at the animal, and as soon as he had left off admiring it, he began, as usual, to tease it; first he poked its eyes with a stick, then he tried to unfold his tail, but the animal flapped, and he ran away. At last he was trying to put his stick into the creature's mouth, when it raised its large claw, and caught him by the wrist, squeezing him so tight that Tommy screamed and danced about as the crayfish held on. Fortunately for him, the animal had been so long out of water, and had been so much hurt by the iron spike of the boat-hook, that it was more than half-dead, or he would have been severely hurt.  Ready ran to him, and disengaged the crayfish; but Tommy was so frightened, that he took to his heels, and did not leave off running until he was one hundred yards from the house, while Juno and Ready were laughing at him till the tears came into their eyes.  When he saw the crayfish on the table, he appeared to be afraid of it, although it was dead.",bring crayfish have claw put pot water boil addition dinner ready go sister look animal leave admire begin usual tease poke eye stick try unfold tail animal flapp run last try put stick creature mouth raise large claw catch wrist squeez tight scream dance crayfish hold animal long water hurt iron spike boat hook more half dead hurt ready run disengage crayfish frighten take heel leave run yard house ready laugh tear come eye see crayfish table appear afraid dead 
20,"""Well, Tommy,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""I suppose you won't eat any of the crayfish?""",say suppose eat crayfish 
21,"""Won't I?"" replied Tommy.  ""I'll eat him, for he tried to eat me.""",reply eat try eat 
22,"""Why did you not leave the animal alone, Tommy?"" said Mr Seagrave; ""if you had not tormented it, it would not have bitten you; I don't know whether you ought to have any.""",leave animal say torment bit know have 
23,"""I don't like it; I won't have any,"" replied Tommy.  ""I like salt pork better.""",like have reply like salt pork good 
24,"""Well, then, if you don't like it, you shall not have it forced upon you, Tommy,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""so now we'll divide it among the rest of us.""",like have force reply divide rest 
25,"Tommy was not very well pleased at this decision, for he really did wish to have some of it, so he turned very sulky for the rest of the dinner-time, especially when old Ready told him that he had had his share of the crayfish before dinner.",pleased decision wish have turn sulky rest dinner time old ready tell have share crayfish dinner
