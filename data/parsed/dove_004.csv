1,CHAPTER III. THE FLOTSAM AND JETSAM OF THE DEBATEABLE FORD,flotsam jetsam debateable 
2," LIFE in Schloss Adlerstein was little less intolerable than Christina’s imagination had depicted it.  It was entirely devoid of all the graces of chivalry, and its squalor and coarseness, magnified into absurdity by haughtiness and violence, were almost inconceivable.  Fortunately for her, the inmates of the castle resided almost wholly below stairs in the hall and kitchen, and in some dismal dens in the thickness of their walls.  The height of the keep was intended for dignity and defence, rather than for habitation; and the upper chamber, with its great state-bed, where everybody of the house of Adlerstein was born and died, was not otherwise used, except when Ermentrude, unable to bear the oppressive confusion below stairs, had escaped thither for quietness’ sake.  No one else wished to inhabit it.  The chamber above was filled with the various appliances for the defence of the castle; and no one would have ever gone up the turret stairs had not a warder been usually kept on the roof to watch the roads leading to the Ford.  Otherwise the Adlersteiners had all the savage instinct of herding together in as small a space as possible.",life little intolerable imagination depict devoid grace chivalry squalor coarseness magnify absurdity haughtiness violence inconceivable inmate castle reside stair hall kitchen dismal den thickness wall height keep intend dignity defence habitation upper chamber great state bed house bear die use unable bear oppressive confusion stair escape quietness sake else wish inhabit chamber fill various appliance defence castle go turret stair warder keep roof watch road lead have savage instinct herding small space possible 
3,"Freiherrin Kunigunde hardly ever mounted to her daughter’s chamber.  All her affection was centred on the strong and manly son, of whom she was proud, while the sickly pining girl, who would hardly find a mate of her own rank, and who had not even dowry enough for a convent, was such a shame and burthen to her as to be almost a distasteful object.  But perversely, as it seemed to her, the only daughter was the darling of both father and brother, who were ready to do anything to gratify the girl’s sick fancies, and hailed with delight her pleasure in her new attendant.  Old Ursel was at first rather envious and contemptuous of the childish, fragile stranger, but her gentleness disarmed the old woman; and, when it was plain that the young lady’s sufferings were greatly lessened by tender care, dislike gave way to attachment, and there was little more murmuring at the menial services that were needed by the two maidens, even when Ermentrude’s feeble fancies, or Christina’s views of dainty propriety, rendered them more onerous than before.  She was even heard to rejoice that some Christian care and tenderness had at last reached her poor neglected child.",mount daughter chamber affection centre strong manly son proud sickly pining girl find mate own rank dowry convent shame burthen distasteful object seem only daughter darling father brother ready do gratify girl sick fancy hail delight pleasure new attendant old first envious contemptuous childish fragile stranger gentleness disarm old woman plain young lady suffering lessen tender care dislike give way attachment be little more murmure menial service need maiden feeble fancy view dainty propriety render onerous hear rejoice christian care tenderness reach poor neglect child 
4,"It was well for Christina that she had such an ally.  The poor child never crept down stairs to the dinner or supper, to fetch food for Ermentrude, or water for herself, without a trembling and shrinking of heart and nerves.  Her father’s authority guarded her from rude actions, but from rough tongues he neither could nor would guard her, nor understand that what to some would have been a compliment seemed to her an alarming insult; and her chief safeguard lay in her own insignificance and want of attraction, and still more in the modesty that concealed her terror at rude jests sufficiently to prevent frightening her from becoming an entertainment.",have ally poor child creep stair dinner supper fetch food water tremble shrinking heart nerve father authority guard rude action rough tongue guard understand compliment seem alarming insult chief safeguard lay own insignificance want attraction more modesty conceal terror rude jest prevent frightening become entertainment 
5,"Her father, whom she looked on as a cultivated person in comparison with the rest of the world, did his best for her after his own views, and gradually brought her all the properties she had left at the Kohler’s hut.  Therewith she made a great difference in the aspect of the chamber, under the full sanction of the lords of the castle.  Wolf, deer, and sheep skins abounded; and with these, assisted by her father and old Hatto, she tapestried the lower part of the bare grim walls, a great bear’s hide covered the neighbourhood of the hearth, and cushions were made of these skins, and stuffed from Ursel’s stores of feathers.  All these embellishments were watched with great delight by Ermentrude, who had never been made of so much importance, and was as much surprised as relieved by such attentions.  She was too young and too delicate to reject civilization, and she let Christina braid her hair, bathe her, and arrange her dress, with sensations of comfort that were almost like health.  To train her into occupying herself was however, as Christina soon found, in her present state, impossible.  She could spin and sew a little, but hated both; and her clumsy, listless fingers only soiled and wasted Christina’s needles, silk, and lute strings, and such damage was not so easily remedied as in the streets of Ulm.  She was best provided for when looking on at her attendant’s busy hands, and asking to be sung to, or to hear tales of the active, busy scenes of the city life—the dresses, fairs, festivals, and guild processions.",father look cultivate person comparison rest world do good own view bring property leave hut make great difference aspect chamber full sanction lord castle deer sheep skin abound assist father old tapestry low part bare grim wall great bear hide cover neighbourhood hearth cushion make skin stuff store feather embellishment watch great delight make much importance surprise relieve such attention young delicate reject civilization let braid hair bathe arrange dress sensation comfort health train occupy find present state impossible spin sew little hate clumsy listless finger soil waste needle silk lute string such damage remedy street provide look attendant busy hand ask sung hear tale active busy scene city life dress fair festival guild procession

7,"The gentle nursing and the new interests made her improve in health, so that her father was delighted, and Christina began to hope for a return home.  Sometimes the two girls would take the air, either, on still days, upon the battlements, where Ermentrude watched the Debateable Ford, and Christina gazed at the Danube and at Ulm; or they would find their way to a grassy nook on the mountain-side, where Christina gathered gentians and saxifrage, trying to teach her young lady that they were worth looking at, and sighing at the thought of Master Gottfried’s wreath when she met with the asphodel seed-vessels.  Once the quiet mule was brought into requisition; and, with her brother walking by her, and Sorel and his daughter in attendance, Ermentrude rode towards the village of Adlerstein.  It was a collection of miserable huts, on a sheltered slope towards the south, where there was earth enough to grow some wretched rye and buckwheat, subject to severe toll from the lord of the soil.  Perched on a hollow rock above the slope was a rude little church, over a cave where a hermit had once lived and died in such odour of sanctity that, his day happening to coincide with that of St. John the Baptist, the Blessed Freidmund had acquired the credit of the lion’s share both of the saint’s honours and of the old solstitial feast of Midsummer.  This wake was the one gaiety of the year, and attracted a fair which was the sole occasion of coming honestly by anything from the outer world; nor had his cell ever lacked a professional anchorite.",gentle nursing new interest make improve health father delighted begin hope return home girl take air day battlement watch debateable gaze find way grassy nook mountain side gather gentian saxifrage try teach young lady worth look sigh thought wreath meet asphodel seed vessel quiet mule bring requisition brother walk daughter attendance ride village collection miserable hut shelter slope south be earth grow wretch rye buckwheat subject severe toll lord soil perch hollow rock slope rude little church cave hermit live die such odour sanctity day happen coincide blessed acquire credit lion share saint honour old solstitial feast wake gaiety year attract fair sole occasion come outer world have cell lack professional anchorite 
8,"The Freiherr of his day had been a devout man, who had gone a pilgrimage with Kaiser Friedrich of the Red Beard, and had brought home a bit of stone from the council chamber of Nicæa, which he had presented to the little church that he had built over the cavern.  He had named his son Friedmund; and there were dim memories of his days as of a golden age, before the Wildschlossen had carried off the best of the property, and when all went well.",day devout man go pilgrimage red bring bit stone council chamber present little church build cavern name son be dim memory day golden age carry good property go 
9,"This was Christina’s first sight of a church since her arrival, except that in the chapel, which was a dismal neglected vault, where a ruinous altar and mouldering crucifix testified to its sacred purpose.  The old baron had been excommunicated for twenty years, ever since he had harried the wains of the Bishop of Augsburg on his way to the Diet; and, though his household and family were not under the same sentence, “Sunday didna come abune the pass.”  Christina’s entreaty obtained permission to enter the little building, but she had knelt there only a few moments before her father came to hurry her away, and her supplications that he would some day take her to mass there were whistled down the wind; and indeed the hermit was a layman, and the church was only served on great festivals by a monk from the convent of St. Ruprecht, on the distant side of the mountain, which was further supposed to be in the Schlangenwald interest.  Her best chance lay in infusing the desire into Ermentrude, who by watching her prayers and asking a few questions had begun to acquire a few clearer ideas.  And what Ermentrude wished had always hitherto been acquiesced in by the two lords.",first sight church arrival chapel dismal neglect vault ruinous altar moulder crucifix testify sacred purpose old baron excommunicate year harry wain way household family same sentence do come pass entreaty obtain permission enter little building knolt few moment father come hurry supplication day take mass whistle wind hermit layman church serve great festival monk convent distant side mountain suppose interest good chance lay infuse desire watch prayer ask few question begin acquire few clear idea wish acquiesce lord 
10,"The elder baron came little into Christina’s way.  He meant to be kind to her, but she was dreadfully afraid of him, and, when he came to visit his daughter, shrank out of his notice as much as possible, shuddering most of all at his attempts at civilities.  His son she viewed as one of the thickwitted giants meant to be food for the heroism of good knights of romance.  Except that he was fairly conversant with the use of weapons, and had occasionally ridden beyond the shadow of his own mountain, his range was quite as limited as his sister’s; and he had an equal scorn for all beyond it.  His unfailing kindness to his sister was however in his favour, and he always eagerly followed up any suggestion Christina made for her pleasure.",elder baron come little way mean kind afraid come visit daughter shrank notice possible shudder most attempt civility son view thickwitted giant mean food heroism good knight romance conversant use weapon ride shadow own mountain range limited sister have equal scorn unfailing kindness sister favour follow suggestion make pleasure 
11,"Much of his time was spent on the child, whose chief nurse and playmate he had been throughout her malady; and when she showed him the stranger’s arrangements, or repeated to him, in a wondering, blundering way, with constant appeals to her attendant, the new tales she had heard, he used to listen with a pleased awkward amazement at his little Ermentrude’s astonishing cleverness, joined sometimes with real interest, which was evinced by his inquiries of Christina.  He certainly did not admire the little, slight, pale bower-maiden, but he seemed to look upon her like some strange, almost uncanny, wise spirit out of some other sphere, and his manner towards her had none of the offensive freedom apparent in even the old man’s patronage.  It was, as Ermentrude once said, laughing, almost as if he feared that she might do something to him.",much time spend child chief nurse playmate malady show stranger arrangement repeat wonder blunder way constant appeal attendant new tale hear use listen pleased awkward amazement little astonish cleverness join real interest evince inquiry admire little slight pale bower maiden seem look strange uncanny wise spirit other sphere manner have offensive freedom apparent old man patronage say laugh fear do 
12,"Christina had expected to see a ruffian, and had found a boor; but she was to be convinced that the ruffian existed in him.  Notice came up to the castle of a convoy of waggons, and all was excitement.  Men-at-arms were mustered, horses led down the Eagle’s Ladder, and an ambush prepared in the woods.  The autumn rains were already swelling the floods, and the passage of the ford would be difficult enough to afford the assailants an easy prey.",expect see ruffian find boor convince ruffian exist notice come castle convoy waggon excitement man arm muster horse lead ambush prepare wood autumn rain swell flood passage ford difficult afford assailant easy prey 
13,"The Freiherrinn Kunigunde herself, and all the women of the castle, hurried into Ermentrude’s room to enjoy the view from her window.  The young lady herself was full of eager expectation, but she knew enough of her maiden to expect no sympathy from her, and loved her well enough not to bring down on her her mother’s attention; so Christina crept into her turret, unable to withdraw her eyes from the sight, trembling, weeping, praying, longing for power to give a warning signal.  Could they be her own townsmen stopped on the way to dear Ulm?",woman castle hurry room enjoy view window young lady full eager expectation know enough maiden expect sympathy love bring mother attention creep turret unable withdraw eye sight tremble weep pray long power give warning signal own townsmen stop way dear 
14,"She could see the waggons in mid-stream, the warriors on the bank; she heard the triumphant outcries of the mother and daughter in the outer room.  She saw the overthrow, the struggle, the flight of a few scattered dark figures on the farther side, the drawing out of the goods on the nearer.  Oh! were those leaping waves bearing down any good men’s corpses to the Danube, slain, foully slain by her own father and this gang of robbers?",see waggon mid-stream warrior bank hear triumphant outcry mother daughter outer room see overthrow struggle flight few scatter dark figure far side draw goods nearer leap wave bear good man corpse slain slain own father gang robber 
15,"She was glad that Ermentrude went down with her mother to watch the return of the victors.  She crouched on the floor, sobbing, shuddering with grief and indignation, and telling her beads alike for murdered and murderers, till, after the sounds of welcome and exultation, she heard Sir Eberhard’s heavy tread, as he carried his sister up stairs. Ermentrude went up at once to Christina.",glad go mother watch return victor crouch floor sobb shudder grief indignation tell bead alike murder murderer sound welcome exultation hear heavy tread carry sister stair go 
16,“After all there was little for us!” she said.  “It was only a wain of wine barrels; and now will the drunkards down stairs make good cheer. But Ebbo could only win for me this gold chain and medal which was round the old merchant’s neck.”,be little say wain wine barrel drunkard stair make good cheer win gold chain medal old merchant neck 
17,“Was he slain?” Christina asked with pale lips.,slain ask pale lip

19,"“But he has brought thee something, Stina,” continued Ermentrude.  “Show it to her, brother.”",bring continue show brother 
20,"“My father sends you this for your care of my sister,” said Eberhard, holding out a brooch that had doubtless fastened the band of the unfortunate wine-merchant’s bonnet.",father send care sister say hold brooch fasten band unfortunate wine merchant bonnet 
21,"“Thanks, sir; but, indeed, I may not take it,” said Christina, turning crimson, and drawing back.",thanks sir take say turn crimson draw 
22,"“So!” he exclaimed, in amaze; then bethinking himself,—“They are no townsfolk of yours, but Constance cowards.”",exclaim amaze bethink townsfolk coward 
23,"“Take it, take it, Stina, or you will anger my father,” added Ermentrude.",take take anger father add 
24,"“No, lady, I thank the barons both, but it were sin in me,” said Christina, with trembling voice.",lady thank baron sin say tremble voice 
25,"“Look you,” said Eberhard; “we have the full right—’tis a seignorial right—to all the goods of every wayfarer that may be overthrown in our river—as I am a true knight!” he added earnestly.",look say have full right seignorial right goods wayfarer overthrown river true knight add 
26,"“A true knight!” repeated Christina, pushed hard, and very indignant in all her terror.  “The true knight’s part is to aid, not rob, the weak.” And the dark eyes flashed a vivid light.",true knight repeat push indignant terror true knight part aid rob weak dark eye flash vivid light 
27,"“Christina!” exclaimed Ermentrude in the extremity of her amazement, “know you what you have said?—that Eberhard is no true knight!”",exclaim extremity amazement know say true knight 
28,"He meanwhile stood silent, utterly taken by surprise, and letting his little sister fight his battles.",stand silent take surprise let little sister fight battle 
29,"“I cannot help it, Lady Ermentrude,” said Christina, with trembling lips, and eyes filling with tears.  “You may drive me from the castle—I only long to be away from it; but I cannot stain my soul by saying that spoil and rapine are the deeds of a true knight.”",help say tremble lip eye fill tear drive castle stain soul say spoil rapine deed true knight 
30,"“My mother will beat you,” cried Ermentrude, passionately, ready to fly to the head of the stairs; but her brother laid his hand upon her.",mother beat cry ready fly head stair brother lay hand 
31,"“Tush, Trudchen; keep thy tongue still, child!  What does it hurt me?”",tush keep tongue child hurt 
32,"And he turned on his heels and went down stairs.  Christina crept into her turret, weeping bitterly and with many a wild thought.  Would they visit her offence on her father?  Would they turn them both out together? If so, would not her father hurl her down the rocks rather than return her to Ulm?  Could she escape?  Climb down the dizzy rocks, it might be, succour the merchant lying half dead on the meadows, protect and be protected, be once more among God-fearing Christians?  And as she felt her helplessness, the selfish thoughts passed into a gush of tears for the murdered man, lying suffering there, and for his possible wife and children watching for him.  Presently Ermentrude peeped in.",turn heel go stair creep turret weep many wild thought visit offence father turn father hurl rock return escape climb dizzy rock succour merchant lie half dead meadow protect protect more -fear feel helplessness selfish thought pass gush tear murder man lie suffer possible wife child watch peep

34,"“That is not what I wept for, lady,” said Christina.  “I do not think you would bring harm on me.  But oh!  I would I were at home!  I grieve for the bloodshed that I must see and may not hinder, and for that poor merchant.”",goot lady say think bring harm home grieve bloodshed see hinder poor merchant 
35,"“Oh,” said Ermentrude, “you need not fear for him!  I saw his own folk return and lift him up.  But what is he to thee or to us?”",say fear see own folk return lift 
36,"“I am a burgher maid, lady,” said Christina, recovering herself, and aware that it was of little use to bear testimony to such an auditor as poor little Ermentrude against the deeds of her own father and brother, which had in reality the sort of sanction Sir Eberhard had mentioned, much akin to those coast rights that were the temptation of wreckers.",burgher maid lady say recover aware little use bear testimony auditor poor little deed own father brother have reality sort sanction mention akin coast right temptation wrecker 
37,"Still she could not but tremble at the thought of her speech, and went down to supper in greater trepidation than usual, dreading that she should be expected to thank the Freiherr for his gift.  But, fortunately, manners were too rare at Adlerstein for any such omission to be remarkable, and the whole establishment was in a state of noisy triumph and merriment over the excellence of the French wine they had captured, so that she slipped into her seat unobserved.",tremble thought speech go supper great trepidation usual dread expect thank gift manners rare such omission remarkable whole establishment state noisy triumph merriment excellence french wine capture slip seat unobserve 
38,"Every available drinking-horn and cup was full.  Ermentrude was eagerly presented with draughts by both father and brother, and presently Sir Eberhard exclaimed, turning towards the shrinking Christina with a rough laugh, “Maiden, I trow thou wilt not taste?”",available drinking horn cup full present draught father brother exclaim turn shrink rough laugh trow taste 
39,"Christina shook her head, and framed a negative with her lips.",shake head frame negative lip 
40,"“What’s this?” asked her father, close to whom she sat.  “Is’t a fast-day?”",ask father close sit set fast day 
41,There was a pause.  Many were present who regarded a fast-day much more than the lives or goods of their neighbours.  Christina again shook her head.,be pause many present regard fast day more life goods neighbour shake head 
42,"“No matter,” said good-natured Sir Eberhard, evidently wishing to avert any ill consequence from her.  “’Tis only her loss.”",matter say good natured wish avert ill consequence loss 
43,"The mirth went on rough and loud, and Christina felt this the worst of all the miserable meals she had partaken of in fear and trembling at this place of her captivity.  Ermentrude, too, was soon in such a state of excitement, that not only was Christina’s womanhood bitterly ashamed and grieved for her, but there was serious danger that she might at any moment break out with some allusion to her maiden’s recusancy in her reply to Sir Eberhard.",mirth go rough loud feel bad miserable meal partake fear tremble place captivity state excitement womanhood ashamed grieve be serious danger moment break allusion maiden recusancy reply 
44,"Presently however Ermentrude laid down her head and began to cry—violent headache had come on—and her brother took her in his arms to carry her up the stairs; but his potations had begun before hers, and his step was far from steady; he stumbled more than once on the steps, shook and frightened his sister, and set her down weeping petulantly.  And then came a more terrible moment; his awe of Christina had passed away; he swore that she was a lovely maiden, with only too free a tongue, and that a kiss must be the seal of her pardon.",lay head begin cry violent headache come brother take arm carry stair potation begin step steady stumble more step shake frighten sister set weep come terrible moment awe pass swore lovely maiden free tongue kiss seal pardon 
45,"A house full of intoxicated men, no living creature who would care to protect her, scarce even her father!  But extremity of terror gave her strength.  She spoke resolutely—“Sir Eberhard, your sister is ill—you are in no state to be here.  Go down at once, nor insult a free maiden.”",house full intoxicated man living creature care protect scarce father extremity terror give strength speak sister ill state go insult free maiden 
46,"Probably the low-toned softness of the voice, so utterly different from the shrill wrangling notes of all the other women he had known, took him by surprise.  He was still sober enough to be subdued, almost cowed, by resistance of a description unlike all he had ever seen; his alarm at Christina’s superior power returned in full force, he staggered to the stairs, Christina rushed after him, closed the heavy door with all her force, fastened it inside, and would have sunk down to weep but for Ermentrude’s peevish wail of distress.",low tone softness voice different shrill wrangling note other woman know take surprise sober subdued cow resistance description see alarm superior power return full force stagger stair rush close heavy door force fasten sink weep peevish wail distress 
47,"Happily Ermentrude was still a child, and, neglected as she had been, she still had had no one to make her precocious in matters of this kind.  She was quite willing to take Christina’s view of the case, and not resent the exclusion of her brother; indeed, she was unwell enough to dread the loudness of his voice and rudeness of his revelry.",child neglect have make precocious matter kind willing take view case resent exclusion brother unwell dread loudness voice rudeness revelry 
48,"So the door remained shut, and Christina’s resolve was taken that she would so keep it while the wine lasted.  And, indeed, Ermentrude had so much fever all that night and the next day that no going down could be thought of.  Nobody came near the maidens but Ursel, and she described one continued orgie that made Christina shudder again with fear and disgust.  Those below revelled without interval, except for sleep; and they took their sleep just where they happened to sink down, then returned again to the liquor.  The old baroness repaired to the kitchen when the revelry went beyond even her bearing; but all the time the wine held out, the swine in the court were, as Ursel averred, better company than the men in the hall.  Yet there might have been worse even than this; for old Ursel whispered that at the bottom of the stairs there was a trap-door.  Did the maiden know what it covered?  It was an oubliette. There was once a Strasburg armourer who had refused ransom, and talked of appealing to the Kaiser.  He trod on that door and—Ursel pointed downwards.  “But since that time,” she said, “my young lord has never brought home a prisoner.”",door remain shut resolve take keep wine last have much fever night next day go think come maiden describe continue orgie make shudder fear disgust revell interval sleep take sleep happen sink return liquor old baroness repair kitchen revelry go bear time wine hold swine court averr good company man hall be bad old whisper bottom stair be trap door maiden know cover oubliette be armourer refuse ransom talk appeal trod door point time say young lord bring prisoner 
49,"No wonder that all this time Christina cowered at the discordant sounds below, trembled, and prayed while she waited on her poor young charge, who tossed and moaned in fever and suffering.  She was still far from recovered when the materials of the debauch failed, and the household began to return to its usual state.  She was soon restlessly pining for her brother; and when her father came up to see her, received him with scant welcome, and entreaties for Ebbo.  She knew she should be better if she might only sit on his knee, and lay her head on his shoulder.  The old Freiherr offered to accommodate her; but she rejected him petulantly, and still called for Ebbo, till he went down, promising that her brother should come.",wonder time cower discordant sound tremble pray wait poor young charge toss moan fever suffering recover material debauch fail household begin return usual state pine brother father come see receive scant welcome entreaty know good sit knee lay head shoulder old offer accommodate reject call go promise brother come 
50,"With a fluttering heart Christina awaited the noble whom she had perhaps insulted, and whose advances had more certainly insulted her.  Would he visit her with his anger, or return to that more offensive familiarity? She longed to flee out of sight, when, after a long interval, his heavy tread was heard; but she could not even take refuge in her turret, for Ermentrude was leaning against her.  Somehow, the step was less assured than usual; he absolutely knocked at the door; and, when he came in, he acknowledged her by a slight inclination of the head.  If she only had known it, this was the first time that head had ever been bent to any being, human or Divine; but all she did perceive was that Sir Eberhard was in neither of the moods she dreaded, only desperately shy and sheepish, and extremely ashamed, not indeed of his excess, which would have been, even to a much tamer German baron, only a happy accident, but of what had passed between himself and her.",flutter heart await noble insult advance insult visit anger return offensive familiarity long flee sight long interval heavy tread hear take refuge turret lean step assure usual knock door come acknowledge slight inclination head know first time head bend being human divine perceive mood dread shy sheepish ashamed excess tamer german baron happy accident pass 
51,"He was much grieved to perceive how much ground Ermentrude had lost, and gave himself up to fondling and comforting her; and in a few days more, in their common cares for the sister, Christina lost her newly-acquired horror of the brother, and could not but be grateful for his forbearance; while she was almost entertained by the increased awe of herself shown by this huge robber baron.",grieve perceive much ground lose give fondling comforting few day common care sister lose acquire horror brother grateful forbearance entertain increase awe show huge robber baron
