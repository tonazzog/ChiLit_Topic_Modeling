1,CHAPTER 9. WORK AND PLAY.,work play 
2,"In a few days Hester was accustomed to her new life.  She fell into its routine, and in a certain measure won the respect of her fellow-pupils. She worked hard, and kept her place in class, and her French became a little more like the French tongue and a little less like the English. She showed marked ability in many of her other studies, and the mistresses and masters spoke well of her.  After a fortnight spent at Lavender House, Hester had to acknowledge that the little Misses Bruce were right, and that school might be a really enjoyable place for some girls.  She would not yet admit that it could be enjoyable for her. Hester was too shy, too proud, too exacting to be popular with her school-fellows.  She knew nothing of school-girl life--she had never learned the great secret of success in all life's perplexities, the power to give and take.  It never occurred to Hester to look over a hasty word, to take no notice of an envious or insolent look.  As far as her lessons were concerned she was doing well; but the hardest lesson of all, the training of mind and character, which the daily companionship of her school-fellows alone could give her, in this lesson she was making no way.  Each day she was shutting herself up more and more from all kindly advances, and the only one in the school whom she sincerely and cordially liked was gentle Cecil Temple.",few day accustom new life fall routine certain measure win respect fellow pupil work keep place class become little french tongue little less show mark ability many other study mistress master speak fortnight spend have acknowledge little right school enjoyable place girl admit enjoyable shy proud exacting popular school fellow know school girl life learn great secret success life perplexity power give take occur look hasty word take notice envious insolent look lesson concerned do hard lesson training mind character daily companionship school fellow give lesson make way day shut more more kindly advance only one school like gentle 
3,"Mrs Willis had some ideas with regard to the training of her young people which were peculiarly her own.  She had found them successful, and, during her thirty years' experience, had never seen reason to alter them.  She was determined to give her girls a great deal more liberty than was accorded in most of the boarding-schools of her day.  She never made what she called impossible rules; she allowed the girls full liberty to chatter in their bedrooms; she did not watch them during play-hours; she never read the letters they received, and only superintended the specimen home letter which each girl was required to write once a month.  Other head-mistresses wondered at the latitude she allowed her girls, but she invariably replied--",have idea regard training young person own find successful year experience see reason alter determined give girl great deal more liberty accord most boarding school day make call impossible rule allow girl full liberty chatter bedroom watch play hour read letter receive superintend specimen home letter girl require write month other head mistress wonder latitude allow girl reply 
4,"""I always find it works best to trust them.  If a girl is found to be utterly untrustworthy.  I don't expel her, but I request her parents to remove her to a more strict school.""",find work good trust girl find untrustworthy expel request parent remove strict school 
5,"Mrs Willis also believed much in that quiet half-hour each evening, when the girls who cared to come could talk to her alone.  On these occasions she always dropped the school-mistress and adopted the _role_ of the mother.  With a very refractory pupil she spoke in the tenderest tones of remonstrance and affection at these times.  If her words failed--if the discipline of the day and the gentle sympathy of these moments at night did not effect their purpose, she had yet another expedient--the vicar was asked to see the girl who would not yield to this motherly influence.",believe much quiet half hour evening girl care come talk occasion drop school mistress adopt _role_ mother refractory pupil speak tenderest tone remonstrance affection time word fail discipline day gentle sympathy moment night effect purpose have expedient vicar ask see girl yield motherly influence 
6,"Mr Everard had very seldom taken Mrs Willis's place.  As he said to her, ""Your influence must be the mainspring.  At supreme moments I will help you with personal influence, but otherwise, except for my nightly prayers with your girls, and my weekly class, and the teachings which they with others hear from my lips Sunday after Sunday, they had better look to you.""",take place say influence mainspring supreme moment help personal influence nightly prayer girl weekly class teaching other hear lip good look 
7,"The girls knew this rule well, and the one or two rare instances in the school history where the vicar had stepped in to interfere, were spoken of with bated breath and with intense awe.",girl know rule rare instance school history vicar step interfere speak bate breath intense awe 
8,Mrs Willis had a great idea of bringing as much happiness as possible into young lives.  It was with this idea that she had the quaint little compartments railed off in the play-room.,have great idea bring much happiness possible young life idea have quaint little compartment rail play room 
9,"""For the elder girls,"" she would say, ""there is no pleasure so great as having, however small the spot, a little liberty hall of their own.  In her compartment each girl is absolute monarch.  No one can enter inside the little curtained rail without her permission.  Here she can show her individual taste, her individual ideas.  Here she can keep her most-prized possessions.  In short, her compartment in the play-room is a little home to her.""",elder girl say be pleasure great have small spot little liberty hall own compartment girl absolute monarch enter little curtain rail permission show individual taste individual idea keep prize possession short compartment play room little home 
10,"The play-room, large as it was, admitted of only twenty compartments; these compartments were not easily won.  No amount of cleverness attained them; they were altogether dependent on conduct.  No girl could be the honourable owner of her own little drawing-room until she had distinguished herself by some special act of kindness and self-denial. Mrs Willis had no fixed rule on this subject.  She alone gave away the compartments, and she often made choice of girls on whom she conferred this honour in a way which rather puzzled and surprised their fellows.",play room large admit compartment compartment win amount cleverness attain dependent conduct girl honourable owner own little draw room distinguish special act kindness self denial have fix rule subject give compartment make choice girl confer honour way puzzle surprise fellow 
11,"When the compartment was won it was not a secure possession.  To retain it depended also on conduct; and here again Mrs Willis was absolute in her sway.  More than once the girls had entered the room in the morning to find some favourite's furniture removed and her little possessions taken carefully down from the walls, the girl herself alone knowing the reason for this sudden change.  Annie Forest, who had been at Lavender House for four years, had once, for a solitary month of her existence, owned her own special drawing-room.  She had obtained it as a reward for an act of heroism.  One of the little pupils had set her pinafore on fire.  There was no teacher present at the moment--the other girls had screamed and run for help, but Annie, very pale, had caught the little one in her arms and had crushed out the flames with her own hands.  The child's life was spared, the child was not even hurt, but Annie was in the hospital for a week.  At the end of a week she returned to the school-room and play-room as the heroine of the hour.  Mrs Willis herself kissed her brow, and presented her in the midst of the approving smiles of her companions with the prettiest drawing-room of the sets. Annie retained her honourable post for one month.",compartment win secure possession retain depend conduct absolute sway more girl enter room morning find favourite furniture remove little possession take wall girl know reason sudden change year solitary month existence own own special draw room obtain reward act heroism little pupil set pinafore fire be teacher present moment other girl scream run help pale catch little one arm crush flame own hand child life spare child hurt hospital week end week return school room play room heroine hour kiss brow present midst approve smile companion prettiest draw room set retain honourable post month 
12,"Never did the girls of Lavender House forget the delights of that month. The fantastic arrangements of the little drawing-room filled them with ecstasies.  Annie was truly Japanese in her style--she was also intensely liberal in all her arrangements.  In the tiny space of this little inclosure wild pranks were perpetrated, ceaseless jokes made up. From Annie's drawing-room issued peals of exquisite mirth.  She gave afternoon tea from a Japanese set of tea-things.  Outside her drawing-room always collected a crowd of girls, who tried to peep over the rail or to draw aside the curtains.  Inside the sacred spot certainly reigned chaos, and one day Miss Danesbury had to fly to the rescue, for in a fit of mad mirth Annie herself had knocked down the little Japanese tea-table, the tea-pot and tea-things were in fragments on the floor, and the tea and milk poured in streams outside the curtains.  Mrs Willis sent for Annie that evening, and Miss Forest retired from her interview with red eyes and a meek expression.",girl forget delight month fantastic arrangement little draw room fill ecstasie japanese style liberal arrangement tiny space little inclosure wild prank perpetrate ceaseless joke make draw room issue peal exquisite mirth give afternoon tea japanese set tea- thing draw room collect crowd girl try peep rail draw curtain sacred spot reign chaos day have fly rescue fit mad mirth knock little japanese tea-table tea pot tea thing fragment floor tea milk pour stream curtain send evening retire interview red eye meek expression 
13,"""Girls,"" she said, in confidence that night, ""good-bye to Japan.  I gave her leave to do it--the care of an empire is more than I can manage.""",girl say confidence night good bye give leave do care empire more manage 
14,"The next day the Japanese drawing-room had been handed over to another possessor, and Annie reigned as queen over her empire no more.",next day japanese draw room hand possessor reign queen empire more 
15,"Mrs Willis, anxious at all times that her girls should be happy, made special arrangements for their benefit on Sunday.  Sunday was by no means dull at Lavender House--Sunday was totally unlike the six days which followed it.  Even the stupidest girl could scarcely complain of the severity of Sunday lessons--even the merriest girl could scarcely speak of the day as dull.  Mrs Willis made an invariable rule of spending all Sunday with her pupils.  On this day she really unbent--on this day she was all during the long hours, what she was during the short half-hour on each evening in the week.  On Sunday she neither reproved nor corrected.  If punishment or correction were necessary, she deputed Miss Good or Miss Danesbury to take her place.  On Sunday she sat with the little children round her knee, and the older girls clustering about her.  Her gracious and motherly face was like a sun shining in the midst of these young girls.  In short, she was like the personified form of Goodness in their midst.  It was necessary, therefore, that all those who wished to do right should be happy on Sunday, and only those few who deliberately preferred evil should shrink from the brightness of this day.",anxious time girl happy make special arrangement benefit means dull day follow stupidest girl complain severity lesson merriest girl speak day dull make invariable rule spend pupil day unbent day long hour short half hour evening week reprove correct punishment correction necessary depute take place sit little child knee old girl cluster gracious motherly face sun shine midst young girl short personified form midst necessary wish do happy few prefer evil shrink brightness day 
16,"It is astonishing how much a sympathising and guiding spirit can effect. The girls at Lavender House thought Sunday the shortest day in the week.  There were no unoccupied or dull moments--school toil was forgotten--school punishment ceased, to be resumed again if necessary on Monday morning.  The girls in their best dresses could chatter freely in English--they could read their favourite books--they could wander about the house as they pleased: for on Sunday the two baize doors were always wide-open, and Mrs Willis's own private suite of rooms was ready to receive them.  If the day was fine they walked to church, each choosing her own companion for the pleasant walk; if the day was wet there was service in the chapel, Mr Everard always conducting either morning or evening prayers.  In the afternoon the girls were allowed to do pretty much as they pleased, but after tea there always came a delightful hour, when the elder girls retired with their mistress into her own special boudoir, and she either told them stories or sang to them as only she could sing.  At sixty years of age Mrs Willis still possessed the most sympathetic and touching voice those girls had ever listened to.  Hester Thornton broke down completely on her first Sunday at Lavender House when she heard her school-mistress sing ""The Better Land.""  No one remarked on her tears, but two people saw them; for her mistress kissed her tenderly that night, and said a few strong words of help and encouragement, and Annie Forest, who made no comment, had also seen them, and wondered vaguely if this new and disagreeable pupil had a heart after all.",astonish much sympathise guide spirit effect girl think short day week be unoccupied dull moment school toil forget school punishment cease resume necessary morning girl good dress chatter read favourite book wander house pleased baize door wide open own private suite room ready receive day fine walk church choose own companion pleasant walk day wet be service chapel conduct morning evening prayer afternoon girl allow do pleased tea come delightful hour elder girl retire mistress own special boudoir tell story sing sing year age possess sympathetic touch voice girl listen break first hear school mistress sing good remark tear person see mistress kiss night say few strong word help encouragement make comment see wonder new disagreeable pupil have heart 
17,"On Sunday night Mrs Willis herself went round to each little bed and gave a mother-kiss to each of her pupils--a mother-kiss and a murmured blessing; and in many breasts resolves were then formed which were to help the girls through the coming week.  Some of these resolves, made not in their own strength, bore fruit in long after-years.  There is no doubt that very few girls who lived long enough at Lavender House ever in after-days found their Sundays dull.",night go little bed give mother kiss pupil mother kiss murmure blessing many breast resolve form help girl come week resolve make own strength bear fruit long year be doubt few girl live day find sunday dull
