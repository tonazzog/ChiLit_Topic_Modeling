2," Probably the day would have been a greater success if Cyril had not been reading _The Last of the Mohicans_. The story was running in his head at breakfast, and as he took his third cup of tea he said dreamily, ""I wish there were Red Indians in England--not big ones, you know, but little ones, just about the right size for us to fight.""",day great success read story run head breakfast take third cup tea say wish be red big one know little one right size fight 
3,"Everyone disagreed with him at the time and no one attached any importance to the incident. But when they went down to the sand-pit to ask for a hundred pounds in two-shilling pieces with Queen Victoria's head on, to prevent mistakes--which they had always felt to be a really reasonable wish that must turn out well--they found out that they had done it again! For the Psammead, which was very cross and sleepy, said--",disagree time attach importance incident go sand pit ask pound shill piece head prevent mistake feel reasonable wish turn find do cross sleepy say

9,"""We always do somehow,"" said Jane sadly.",do say 
10,"And now the odd thing was that no one could remember anyone's having wished for anything that morning. The wish about the Red Indians had not stuck in anyone's head. It was a most anxious morning. Everyone was trying to remember what had been wished for, and no one could, and everyone kept expecting something awful to happen every minute. It was most agitating; they knew from what the Psammead had said, that they must have wished for something more than usually undesirable, and they spent several hours in most agonizing uncertainty. It was not till nearly dinner-time that Jane tumbled over _The Last of the Mohicans_,--which had of course, been left face downwards on the floor,--and when Anthea had picked her and the book up she suddenly said, ""I know!"" and sat down flat on the carpet.",odd thing remember wish morning wish red stick head anxious morning try remember wish keep expect awful happen minute agitate know say wish more undesirable spend several hour agonizing uncertainty dinner time tumble course leave face floor pick book say know sit flat carpet 
11,"""Oh, Pussy, how awful! It was Indians he wished for--Cyril--at breakfast, don't you remember? He said, 'I wish there were Red Indians in England,'--and now there are, and they're going about scalping people all over the country, as likely as not.""",awful wish breakfast remember say wish be red be go scalp person country likely

15,"""Not it!"" said Anthea. ""The things that grow out of the wishes don't go. Look at the fifteen shillings! Pussy, I'm going to break something, and you must let me have every penny of money you've got. The Indians will come _here_, don't you see? That Spiteful Psammead as good as said so.

17,"Anthea lifted down the heavy water-jug--it had a pattern of storks and long grasses on it, which Anthea never forgot. She carried it into the dressing-room, and carefully emptied the water out of it into the bath. Then she took the jug back into the bedroom and dropped it on the floor. You know how a jug always breaks if you happen to drop it by accident. If you happen to drop it on purpose, it is quite different. Anthea dropped that jug three times, and it was as unbroken as ever. So at last she had to take her father's boot-tree and break the jug with that in cold blood. It was heartless work.",lift heavy water jug have pattern stork long grasse forget carry dress room empty water bath take jug bedroom drop floor know jug break happen drop accident happen drop purpose different drop jug time unbroken last have take father boot tree break jug cold blood heartless work 
18,"Next she broke open the missionary-box with the poker. Jane told her that it was wrong, of course, but Anthea shut her lips very tight and then said--",break open missionary box poker tell wrong course shut lip tight say

22,"Anthea tied up the money in a corner of her pocket-handkerchief. ""Come on, Jane!"" she said, and ran down to the farm. She knew that the farmer was going into Rochester that afternoon. In fact it had been arranged that he was to take the four children with him. They had planned this in the happy hour when they believed that they we're going to get that hundred pounds, in two-shilling pieces, out of the Psammead. They had arranged to pay the farmer two shillings each for the ride. Now Anthea hastily explained to him that they could not go, but would he take Martha and the Baby instead? He agreed, but he was not pleased to get only half-a-crown instead of eight shillings.",tie money corner pocket handkerchief come say run farm know farmer go afternoon fact arrange take child plan happy hour believe go get pound shilling piece arrange pay farmer shilling ride explain go take agree pleased get half crown shilling 
23,"Then the girls ran home again. Anthea was agitated, but not flurried. When she came to think it over afterwards, she could not help seeing that she had acted with the most far-seeing promptitude, just like a born general. She fetched a little box from her corner drawer, and went to find Martha, who was laying the cloth and not in the best of tempers.",girl run agitate flurry come think help see act see promptitude bear general fetched little box corner drawer go find lay cloth good temper

26,"""Don't be cross, Martha dear,"" said Anthea. ""I've got enough money to pay for a new one--if only you'll be a dear and go and buy it for us. Your cousins keep a china-shop, don't they?

Jane'll finish laying the cloth, and I'll wash the Lamb and get him ready.""",go think say hurry dress put lovely purple frock hat pink cornflower yellow lace collar finish lay cloth wash get ready 
35,"As she washed the unwilling Lamb and hurried him into his best clothes, Anthea peeped out of the window from time to time; so far all was well--she could see no Red Indians. When with a rush and a scurry and some deepening of the damask of Martha's complexion she and the Lamb had been got off, Anthea drew a deep breath.",wash unwilling hurry good clothes peep window time time see red rush scurry deepening damask complexion get draw deep breath 
36,"""_He's_ safe!"" she said, and, to Jane's horror, flung herself down on the floor and burst into floods of tears. Jane did not understand at all how a person could be so brave and like a general, and then suddenly give way and go flat like an air-balloon when you prick it. It is better not to go flat, of course, but you will observe that Anthea did not give way till her aim was accomplished. She had got the dear Lamb out of danger--she felt certain that the Red Indians would be round the White House or nowhere--the farmer's cart would not come back till after sunset, so she could afford to cry a little. It was partly with joy that she cried, because she had done what she meant to do. She cried for about three minutes, while Jane hugged her miserably and said at five-second intervals, ""Don't cry, Panther dear!""",safe say horror flung floor burst flood tear understand person brave general give way go flat air balloon prick good go flat course observe give way aim accomplish get dear danger feel certain red white farmer cart come sunset afford cry little joy cry do mean do cry minute hugge say second interval cry dear 
37,"Then she jumped up, rubbed her eyes hard with the corner of her pinafore, so that they kept red for the rest of the day, and started to tell the boys. But just at that moment cook rang the dinner-bell, and nothing could be said till they had been helped to minced beef. Then cook left the room, and Anthea told her tale. But it is a mistake to tell a thrilling tale when people are eating minced beef and boiled potatoes. There seemed somehow to be something about the food that made the idea of Red Indians seem flat and unbelievable. The boys actually laughed, and called Anthea a little silly.",jump rub eye corner pinafore keep red rest day start tell boy moment cook ring dinner bell say help mince beef cook leave room tell tale mistake tell thrilling tale person eat mince beef boil potato seem food make idea red seem flat unbelievable boy laugh call little silly

I believe it's the fine day.""",go salt mustard have make mush go infest place know believe fine day 
41,"""Then why did the Sammyadd say we'd let ourselves in for a nice thing?"" asked Anthea. She was feeling very cross. She knew she had acted with nobility and discretion, and after that it was very hard to be called a little silly, especially when she had the weight of a burglared missionary-box and about seven-and-fourpence, mostly in coppers, lying like lead upon her conscience.",say let nice thing ask feel cross know act nobility discretion hard call little silly have weight burglare missionary box fourpence copper lie lead conscience 
42,"There was a silence, during which cook took away the mincy plates and brought in the pudding. As soon as she had retired, Cyril began again.",be silence cook take mincy plate bring pudding retire begin 
43,"""Of course I don't mean to say,"" he admitted, ""that it wasn't a good thing to get Martha and the Lamb out of the way for the afternoon; but as for Red Indians--why, you know jolly well the wishes always come that very minute.

46,"""No, they don't,"" said Cyril tartly. ""And I'm not unkind, I'm only truthful.

47,"""Shut up, can't you?"" said Robert; but Cyril couldn't. You see, he felt in his heart that if there _should_ be Indians they would be entirely his own fault, so he did not wish to believe in them.

49,"He had turned towards the window to point out the fineness of the day--the others turned too--and a frozen silence caught at Cyril, and none of the others felt at all like breaking it. For there, peering round the corner of the window, among the red leaves of the Virginia creeper, was a face--a brown face, with a long nose and a tight mouth and very bright eyes. And the face was painted in coloured patches. It had long black hair, and in the hair were feathers!",turn window point fineness day other turn freeze silence catch other feel break peer corner window red leave creeper face brown face long nose tight mouth bright eye face paint coloured patch have long black hair hair feather

58,"""The only thing I can think of,"" said Anthea, who was now generally admitted to be the heroine of the day, ""is--if we dressed up as like Indians as we can, and looked out of the windows, or even went out.

62,"""Of course. You can't be really scalped or burned to death without noticing it, and you'd be sure to notice it next day, even if it escaped your attention at the time,"" said Cyril.

Of course none of the children happened to have long black hair, but there was a lot of black calico that had been bought to cover school-books with. They cut strips of this into a sort of fine fringe, and fastened it round their heads with the amber-coloured ribbons off the girls' Sunday dresses. Then they stuck turkeys' feathers in the ribbons.

Their first rush knocked down some half-dozen Indians, over whose blanketed bodies the children leaped, and made straight for the sand-pit.

Next moment they were released, and fell in a trembling heap. Their heads did not hurt at all. They only felt strangely cool! Wild war-whoops rang in their ears. When they ventured to open their eyes they saw four of their foes dancing round them with wild leaps and screams, and each of the four brandished in his hand a scalp of long flowing black hair.

They were full of rosy visions, and, whereas on the other days they had often found it extremely difficult to think of anything really nice to wish for, their brains were now full of the most beautiful and sensible ideas. ""This,"" as Jane remarked afterwards, ""is always the way."" Everyone was up extra early that morning, and these plans were hopefully discussed in the garden before breakfast. The old idea of one hundred pounds in modern florins was still first favourite, but there were others that ran it close--the chief of these being the ""pony-each"" idea. This had a great advantage. You could wish for a pony each during the morning, ride it all day, have it vanish at sunset, and wish it back again next day. Which would be an economy of litter and stabling. But at breakfast two things happened. First, there was a letter from mother. Granny was better, and mother and father hoped to be home that very afternoon. A cheer arose. And of course this news at once scattered all the before-breakfast wish-ideas. For everyone saw quite plainly that the wish of the day must be something to please mother and not to please themselves.",child know full rosy vision other day find difficult think nice wish brain full beautiful sensible idea remark way morning plan discuss garden breakfast old idea pound modern florin first favourite be other run close chief pony idea have great advantage wish pony morning ride day have vanish sunset wish next day economy litter stabling breakfast thing happen be letter mother good mother father hope very afternoon cheer arise course news scatter breakfast wish idea see wish day please mother please
