1,CHAPTER VIII. _The Prince is Puzzled_,
2,"PRINCE PRIGIO did not go to bed. It was bright daylight, and he had promised to bring the horns and tail of a Firedrake as a present to a pretty lady. He had said it was easy to do this; but now, as he sat and thought over it, he did not feel so victorious.",go bed bright daylight promise bring horn tail present pretty lady say easy do sit think feel victorious

5,"“It _should_ be here!” he cried, tossing the fairies’ gifts about; “and, by George, here it is!”",cry toss fairy gift 
6,"Indeed, he had found the spyglass of carved ivory which Prince Ali, in the _Arabian Nights_, bought in the bazaar in Schiraz. Now, this glass was made so that, by looking through it, you could see anybody or anything you wished, however far away. Prigio’s first idea was to look at his lady. “But she does not expect to be looked at,” he thought; “and I _won’t!_” On the other hand, he determined to look at the Firedrake; for, of course, he had no delicacy about spying on _him_, the brute.",find spyglass carve ivory buy bazaar glass make look see wish first idea look lady expect look think other hand determine look course have delicacy spying brute 
7,"The prince clapped the glass to his eye, stared out of window, and there, sure enough, he saw the Firedrake. He was floating about in a sea of molten lava, on the top of a volcano. There he was, swimming and diving for pleasure, tossing up the flaming waves, and blowing fountains of fire out of his nostrils, like a whale spouting!",prince clapp glass eye stare window see float sea molten lava top volcano swim diving pleasure toss flame wave blow fountain fire nostril whale spout

9,"“With all my cap of darkness, and my shoes of swiftness, and my sword of sharpness, I never could get near that beast,” he said; “and if I _did_ stalk him, I could not hurt him. Poor little Alphonso! poor Enrico! what plucky fellows they were! I fancied that there was no such thing as a Firedrake: he’s not in the Natural History books; and I thought the boys were only making fun, and would be back soon, safe and sound. How horrid being too clever makes one! And now, what _am_ I to do?”",cap darkness shoe swiftness sword sharpness get beast say stalk hurt poor little poor plucky fellow fancy be such thing natural book think boy make fun safe sound horrid clever make do 
10,"What was he to do, indeed? And what would you have done? Bring the horns and tail he must, or perish in the adventure. Otherwise, how could he meet his lady?--why, she would think him a mere braggart.",do do bring horn tail perish adventure meet lady think mere braggart 
11,"The prince sat down, and thought and thought; and the day went on, and it was now high noon.",prince sit think think day go high noon 
12,"At last he jumped up and rushed into the library, a room where nobody ever went except himself and the queen. There he turned the books upside down, in his haste, till he found an old one, by a French gentleman, Monsieur Cyrano de Bergerac. It was an account of a voyage to the moon, in which there is a great deal of information about matters not generally known; for few travellers have been to the moon. In that book, Prince Prigio fancied he would find something he half remembered, and that would be of use to him. And he _did!_ So you see that cleverness, and minding your book, have some advantages, after all. For here the prince learned that there is a very rare beast called a Remora, which is at least as cold as the Firedrake is hot!",last jump rush library room go queen turn book haste find old one french gentleman account voyage moon be great deal information matter know few traveller moon book fancy find remember use see cleverness mind book have advantage prince learn be rare beast call least cold hot 
13,"“Now,” thought he, “_if I can only make these two fight_, why the Remora may kill the Firedrake, or take the heat out of him, at least, so that I may have a chance.”",think make fight_ kill take heat least have chance 
14,"Then he seized the ivory glass, clapped it to his eye, and looked for the Remora. Just the tip of his nose, as white as snow and as smooth as ice, was sticking out of a chink in a frozen mountain, not far from the burning mountain of the Firedrake.",seize ivory glass clapp eye look tip nose white snow smooth ice stick chink freeze mountain burning mountain 
15," “Hooray!” said the prince softly to himself; and he jumped like mad into the winged shoes of swiftness, stuck on the cap of darkness, girdled himself with the sword of sharpness, and put a good slice of bread, with some cold tongue, in a wallet, which he slung on his back. Never you fight, if you can help it, except with plenty of food to keep you going and in good heart. Then off he flew, and soon he reached the volcano of the Firedrake.",say prince jump mad winged shoe swiftness stuck cap darkness girdle sword sharpness put good slice bread cold tongue wallet sling back fight help plenty food keep go good heart fly reach volcano
