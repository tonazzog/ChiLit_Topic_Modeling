1,CHAPTER 37. A BROKEN TRUST.,broken trust 
2,"The next morning Annie Forest opened her eyes with that strange feeling of indifference and want of vivacity which come so seldom to youth.  She saw the sun shining through the closed blinds; she heard the birds twittering and singing in the large elm-tree which nearly touched the windows; she knew well how the world looked at this moment, for often and often in her old light-hearted days she had risen before the maid came to call her, and, kneeling by the deep window-ledge, had looked out at the bright fresh, sparkling day.  A new day, with all its hours before it, its light vivid but not too glaring, its dress all manner of tender shades and harmonious colourings!  Annie had a poetical nature, and she gloried in these glimpses which she got all by herself of the fresh, glad world.",next morning open eye strange feeling indifference want vivacity come seldom youth see sun shine close blind hear bird twiteer sing large elm tree touch window know world look moment old light hearted day rise maid come call kneel deep window ledge look bright fresh sparkling day new day hour light vivid glaring dress manner tender shade harmonious colouring have poetical nature glory glimpse get fresh glad world

6,"She first finished her toilet, and then approached her little bed, and stood by its side for a moment hesitating.  She did not want to pray, and yet she felt impelled to go down on her knees.  As she knelt with her curls falling about her face, and her bands pressed to her eyes, one line of one of her favourite poems came flashing with swiftness and power across; her memory--",finish toilet approach little bed stand side moment hesitate want pray feel impell go knee knolt curl fall face band press eye line favourite poem come flash swiftness power memory

I am tired of this sort of thing--I am tired of standing in this place and appealing to your honour, which is dead, to your truth, which is nowhere.  Girls, you puzzle me--you half break my heart.  In this case more than one is guilty.  How many of the girls in Lavender House are going to tell me a lie this morning?""

50,"""Susan,"" said Mrs Willis, ""I don't ask you if you are guilty; I fear, poor miserable girl, that if I did you would load your conscience with a fresh lie.  I don't ask you if you are guilty because I know you are. The fact of your running without leave to see old Betty is circumstantial evidence.  I judge you by that and pronounce you guilty. Now, young ladies, you who have treated me so badly, who have betrayed my trust, who have been wanting in honour, I must think, I must ask God to teach me how to deal with you.  In the meantime, you cannot associate with your companions.  Miss Good, will you take each of these eight girls to their bedrooms.""",say ask guilty fear poor miserable girl load conscience fresh lie ask guilty know fact running leave see old circumstantial evidence judge pronounce guilty young lady treat betray trust want honour think ask teach deal meantime associate companion take girl bedroom 
51,"As Annie was leaving the room she looked full into Mrs Willis's face. Strange to say, at this moment of her great disgrace the cloud which had so long brooded over her was lifted.  The sweet eyes never looked sweeter.  The old Annie, and yet a better and a braver Annie than had ever existed before, followed her companions out of the school-room.",leave room look full face strange say moment great disgrace cloud brood lift sweet eye look sweeter old good brave exist follow companion school room
