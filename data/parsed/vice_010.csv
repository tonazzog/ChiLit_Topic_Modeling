4," Mr. Bultitude had meant to achieve a double stroke of diplomacy--to undeceive Dulcie and conciliate the lovesick Tipping. But whatever his success may have been in the former respect, the latter object failed conspicuously.",mean achieve double stroke diplomacy undeceive conciliate lovesick tipping success former respect latter object fail 
5,"""You shan't get off by a shabby trick like that,"" said Tipping, exasperated by the sight of Dulcie's emotion; ""you've made her cry now, and you shall smart for it. So, now, are you going to stand up to me like a man, or will you take a licking?""",get shabby trick say exasperate sight emotion make cry smart go stand man take lick 
6,"""I'm not going to help you to commit a breach of the peace,"" said Paul with great dignity. ""Go away, you quarrelsome young ruffian! Get one of your schoolfellows to fight you, if you must fight. I don't want to be mixed up with you in any way.""",go help commit breach peace say great dignity go quarrelsome young ruffian get schoolfellow fight fight want mix way 
7,"But at this Tipping, whose blood was evidently at boiling point, came prancing down on him in a Zulu-like fashion, swinging his long arms like a windmill, and finding that his enemy made no attempt at receiving him, but only moved away apprehensively, he seized him by the collar as a prelude to dealing him a series of kicks behind.",blood boil point come prance like fashion swing long arm windmill find enemy make attempt receive move seize collar prelude deal series kick 
8,"Although Mr. Bultitude, as we have seen, was opposed to fighting as a system he could not submit to this sort of thing without at least some attempt to defend himself; and judging it of the highest importance to disable his adversary in the most effectual manner before the latter had time to carry out his offensive designs, he turned sharply round and hit him a very severe blow in the lower part of his waistcoat.",see oppose fight system submit sort thing least attempt defend judge high importance disable adversary effectual manner latter have time carry offensive design turn hit severe blow low part waistcoat 
9,"The result fulfilled his highest expectations. Tipping collapsed like a pocket-rule, and staggered away speechless, and purple with pain, while Paul stood calm and triumphant. He had shown these fellows that he wasn't going to stand any nonsense. They would leave him alone after this, perhaps.",result fulfil high expectation tipping collapse pocket rule stagger speechless purple pain stand calm triumphant show fellow go stand nonsense leave 
10,"But once more there were cries and murmurs of ""Shame!"" ""No hitting below the belt!"" ""Cad--coward!""",more be cry murmur hit belt 
11,"It appeared that, somehow, he had managed to offend their prejudices even in this. ""It's very odd,"" he thought; ""when I didn't fight they called me a coward, and now, when I do, I don't seem to have pleased them much. I don't care, though. I've settled _him_.""",appear manage offend prejudice odd think fight call coward do seem pleased much care settle 
12,"But after a season of protracted writhing by the parallel bars, Tipping came out, still gasping and deadly pale, leaning on Biddlecomb's shoulder, and was met with universal sympathy and condolence.",season protracted writhing parallel bar come gasp deadly pale lean shoulder meet universal sympathy condolence 
13,"""Thanks!"" he said with considerable effort. ""Of course--I'm not going--to fight him after a low trick like that; but perhaps you fellows will see that he doesn't escape quite as easily as he fancies?""",thanks say considerable effort course go fight low trick fellow see escape fancy 
14,"There was a general shout. ""No; he shall pay for it! We'll teach him to fight fair! We'll see if he tries that on again!""",be general shout pay teach fight fair see try 
15,Paul heard it with much uneasiness. What new devilry were they about to practise upon him? He was not left long in doubt.,hear much uneasiness new devilry about practise leave long doubt 
16,"""I vote,"" suggested Biddlecomb, as if he were proposing a testimonial, ""we make him run the gauntlet. Grim won't come out and catch us. I saw him go out for a drive an hour ago."" And the idea was very favourably entertained.",vote suggest propose testimonial make run gauntlet grim come catch see go drive hour idea entertain 
17,"Paul had heard of ""running the gauntlet,"" and dimly suspected that it was not an experience he was likely to enjoy, particularly when he saw everyone busying himself with tying the end of his pocket-handkerchief into a hard knot. He tried in vain to excuse himself, declaring again and again that he had never meant to injure the boy. He had only defended himself, and was under the impression that he was at perfect liberty to hit him wherever he could, and so on. But they were in no mood for excuses.",hear run gauntlet suspect experience likely enjoy see busy tie end pocket handkerchief hard knot try vain excuse declare mean injure boy defend impression perfect liberty hit mood excuse 
18,"With a stern magisterial formality worthy of a Vehm-Gericht, they formed in two long lines down the centre of the playground; and while Paul was still staring in wonder at what this strange manoeuvre might mean, somebody pounced upon him and carried him up to one end of the ranks, where Tipping had by this time sufficiently recovered to be able to ""set him going,"" as he chose to call it, with a fairly effective kick.",stern magisterial formality worthy form long line centre playground stare wonder strange manoeuvre mean pounce carry end rank have time recover able set go choose call effective kick 
19,"After that he had a confused sense of flying madly along the double line of avengers under a hail of blows which caught him on every part of his head, shoulders, and back till he reached the end, where he was dexterously turned and sent spinning up to Tipping again, who in his turn headed him back on his arrival, and forced him to brave the terrible lane once more.",have confused sense fly double line avenger hail blow catch part head shoulder reach end turn send spinn turn head arrival force brave terrible lane more 
20,"Never before had Mr. Bultitude felt so sore and insulted. But they kept it up long after the thing had lost its first freshness--until at last exhaustion made them lean to mercy, and they cuffed him ignominiously into a corner, and left him to lament his ill-treatment there till the bell rang for dinner, for which, contrary to precedent, his recent violent exercise had excited little appetite.",have feel sore insult keep thing lose first freshness last exhaustion make lean mercy cuff corner leave lament ill treatment bell ring dinner contrary precedent recent violent exercise excite little appetite 
21,"""I shall be killed soon if I stay here,"" he moaned; ""I know I shall. These young brigands would murder me cheerfully, if they were not afraid of being caned for it. I'm a miserable man, and I wish I was dead!""",kill stay moan know young brigand murder afraid cane miserable man wish dead 
22,"Although that afternoon, being Saturday, was a half-holiday, Mr. Bultitude was spared the ordeal of another game at football; for a smart storm of rain and sleet coming on about three o'clock kept the school--not altogether unwilling prisoners--within doors for the day.",afternoon half holiday spare ordeal game football smart storm rain sleet come o'clock keep school unwilling prisoner door day 
23,"The boys sat in their places in their schoolroom, amusing themselves after their several fashions--some reading, some making libellous copies of drawings that took their fancy in the illustrated papers, some playing games; others, too listless to play and too dull to find pleasure in the simplest books, filled up the time as well as they could by quarrelling and getting into various depths of hot water. Paul sat in a corner pretending to read a story relating the experiences of certain infants of phenomenal courage and coolness in the Arctic regions. They killed bears and tamed walruses all through the book; but for the first time, perhaps, since their appearance in print their exploits fell flat. Not, however, that this reflected any discredit upon the author's powers, which are justly admired by all healthy-minded boys; but it was beyond the power of literature just then to charm Mr. Bultitude's thoughts from the recollection of his misfortunes.",boy sit place schoolroom amusing several fashion reading make libellous copy drawing take fancy illustrate paper play game other listless play dull find pleasure simple book fill time quarrell get various depth hot water sit corner pretend read story relate experience certain infant phenomenal courage coolness arctic region kill bear tame walruse book first time appearance print exploit fall flat reflect discredit author power admire healthy minded boy power literature charm thought recollection misfortune 
24,"As he took in all the details of his surroundings--the warm close room; the raw-toned desks and tables at which a rabble of unsympathetic boys were noisily whispering and chattering, with occasional glances in his direction, from which, taught by experience, he augured no good; the high uncurtained windows, blurred with little stars of half-frozen rain, and the bare, bleak branches of the trees outside tossing drearily against a low leaden sky--he tried in vain to cheat himself into a dreamy persuasion that all this misery could not be real, but would fade away as suddenly and mysteriously as it had stolen upon him.",take detail surroundings warm close room raw tone desk table rabble unsympathetic boy whisper chatter occasional glance direction teach experience augure good high uncurtained window blur little star half freeze rain bare bleak branch tree toss low leaden sky try vain cheat dreamy persuasion misery real fade steal 
25,"Towards the close of the afternoon the Doctor came in and took his place at the writing-table, where he was apparently very busy with the composition of some sort of document, which he finished at last with evident satisfaction at the result of his labour. Then he observed that, according to their custom of a Saturday afternoon, the hour before tea-time should be devoted to ""writing home.""",close afternoon come take place writing table busy composition sort document finish last evident satisfaction result labour observe accord custom afternoon hour tea time devote writing home 
26,"So the books, chess-boards, and dominoes were all put away, and a new steel pen and a sheet of notepaper, neatly embossed with the heading ""Crichton House School"" in old English letters, having been served out to everyone, each boy prepared himself to write down such things as filial affection, strict truthfulness, and the desire of imparting information might inspire between them.",book chess board dominoe put new steel pen sheet notepaper emboss heading old english letter serve boy prepare write such thing filial affection strict truthfulness desire impart information inspire 
27,"Paul felt, as he clutched his writing materials, much as a shipwrecked mariner might be expected to do at finding on his desolate island a good-sized flag and a case of rockets. His hopes revived once more; he forgot the smarts left by the knots in the handkerchiefs, he had a whole hour before him--it was possible to set several wires in motion for his release in an hour.",feel clutch writing material much shipwrecked mariner expect do find desolate island good size flag case rocket hope revive more forget smart leave knot handkerchief have whole hour possible set several wire motion release hour 
28,"Yes, he must write several letters. First, one to his solicitor detailing, as calmly and concisely as his feelings would allow, the shameful way in which he had been treated, and imploring him to take measures of some sort for getting him out of his false and awkward position; one to his head clerk, to press upon him the necessity of prudence and caution in dealing with the impostor; notes to Bangle and Fishwick putting them off--they should not be outraged by an introduction to a vulgar pantomime clown under his roof; and lastly (this was an outburst he could not deny himself), a solemn impressive appeal to the common humanity, if not to the ordinary filial instincts, of his undutiful son.",write several letter solicitor detail feeling allow shameful way treat implor take measure sort get false awkward position head clerk press necessity prudence caution deal impostor note put outrage introduction vulgar pantomime clown roof outburst deny solemn impressive appeal common humanity ordinary filial instinct undutiful son 
29,"His fingers tingled to begin. Sentences of burning, indignant eloquence crowded confusedly into his head--he would write such letters as would carry instant conviction to the most practical and matter-of-fact minds. The pathos and dignity of his remonstrances should melt even Dick's selfish, callous heart.",finger tingle begin sentence burning indignant eloquence crowd head write such letter carry instant conviction practical matter fact mind patho dignity remonstrance melt selfish callous heart 
30,"Perhaps he overrated the power of his pen--perhaps it would have required more than mere ink to persuade his friends to disbelieve their own senses, and see a portly citizen of over fifty packed into the frame of a chubby urchin of fourteen. But, at all events, no one's faith was put to so hard a test--those letters were never written.",overrate power pen-- require more mere ink persuade friend disbelieve own sense see portly citizen pack frame chubby urchin event faith put test letter write 
31,"""Don't begin to write yet, any of you,"" said the Doctor; ""I have a few words to say to you first. In most cases, and as a general rule, I think it wisest to let every boy commit to paper whatever his feelings may dictate to him. I wish to claim no censorship over the style and diction of your letters. But there have been so many complaints lately from the parents of some of the less advanced of you, that I find myself obliged to make a change. Your father particularly, Richard Bultitude,"" he added, turning suddenly upon the unlucky Paul, ""has complained bitterly of the slovenly tone and phrasing of your correspondence; he said very justly that they would disgrace a stable-boy, and unless I could induce you to improve them, he begged he might not be annoyed by them in future.""",begin write say have few word say most case general rule think wisest let boy commit paper feeling dictate wish claim censorship style diction letter be many complaint parent advanced find oblige make change father add turn unlucky complain slovenly tone phrasing correspondence say disgrace stable boy induce improve begg annoy future 
32,"It was by no means the least galling part of Mr. Bultitude's trials, that former forgotten words and deeds of his in his original condition were constantly turning up at critical seasons, and plunging him deeper into the morass just when he saw some prospect of gaining firm ground.",mean least galling part trial former forget word deed original condition turn critical season plung morass see prospect gain firm ground 
33,"So, on this occasion, he did remember that, being in a more than usually bad temper one day last year, he had, on receiving a sprawling, ill-spelt application from Dick for more pocket-money, to buy fireworks for the 5th of November, written to make some such complaint to the schoolmaster. He waited anxiously for the Doctor's next words; he might want to read the letters before they were sent off, in which case Paul would not be displeased, for it would be an easier and less dangerous way of putting the Doctor in possession of the facts.",occasion remember more bad temper day last year receive sprawling ill spelt application more pocket money buy firework 5th write make such complaint schoolmaster wait next word want read letter send case displease easy dangerous way put doctor possession fact 
34,"But his complaints were to be honoured by a much more effectual remedy, for it naturally piqued the Doctor to be told that boys instructed under his auspices wrote like stable-boys. ""However,"" he went on, ""I wish your people at home to be assured from time to time of your welfare, and to prevent them from being shocked and distressed in future by the crudity of your communications, I have drawn up a short form of letter for the use of the lower boys in the second form--which I shall now proceed to dictate. Of course all boys in the first form, and all in the second above Bultitude and Jolland, will write as they please, as usual. Richard, I expect you to take particular pains to write this out neatly. Are you all ready? Very well then, ... now;"" and he read out the following letter, slowly--",complaint honoure effectual remedy pique tell boy instruct auspices write stable boy go wish person home assure time time welfare prevent shocked distressed future crudity communication draw short form letter use low boy second form proceed dictate course boy first form second write usual expect take particular pain write ready read follow letter 
35,"""My dear Parents (or parent according to circumstances) comma"" (all of which several took down most industriously)--""You will be rejoiced to hear that, having arrived with safety at our destination, we have by this time fully resumed our customary regular round of earnest work relieved and sweetened by hearty play. ('Have you all got ""hearty play"" down?'"" inquired the Doctor rather suspiciously, while Jolland observed in an undertone that it would take some time to get _that_ down.) ""I hope, I trust I may say without undue conceit, to have made considerable progress in my school-tasks before I rejoin the family circle for the Easter vacation, as I think you will admit when I inform you of the programme we intend"" ('D.V. in brackets and capital letters'--as before, this was taken down verbatim by Jolland, who probably knew very much better), ""intend to work out during the term.",dear parent parent accord circumstance comma several take most rejoice hear arrive safety destination have time resume customary regular round earnest work relieve sweeten hearty play get hearty play inquire observe undertone take time get _that_ hope trust say undue conceit make considerable progress school task rejoin family circle vacation think admit inform programme intend bracket capital letter take verbatim know intend work term 
36,"""In Latin, the class of which I am a member propose to thoroughly master the first book of Virgil's magnificent Epic, need I say I refer to the soul-moving story of the Pious Ãneas?"" (Jolland was understood by his near neighbours to remark that he thought the explanation distinctly advisable), ""whilst, in Greek, we have already commenced the thrilling account of the 'Anabasis' of Xenophon, that master of strategy! nor shall we, of course, neglect in either branch of study the syntax and construction of those two noble languages""--(""noble languages,"" echoed the writers mechanically, contriving to insinuate a touch of irony into the words).",class member propose master first book magnificent need say refer soul move story Ã¦neas understand near neighbour remark think explanation advisable commence thrilling account master strategy course neglect branch study syntax construction noble language noble language echoe writer contrive insinuate touch irony word 
37,"""In German under the able tutelage of Herr Stohwasser, who, as I may possibly have mentioned to you in casual conversation, is a graduate of the University of Heidelberg"" (""and a silly old hass,"" added Jolland parenthetically), ""we have resigned ourselves to the spell of the Teutonian Shakespeare"" (there was much difference of opinion as to the manner of spelling the ""Teutonian Shakespeare""), ""as, in my opinion, Schiller may be not inaptly termed, and our French studies comprise such exercises, and short poems and tales, as are best calculated to afford an insight into the intricacies of the Gallic tongue.",able tutelage mention casual conversation graduate silly old hass add resign spell be much difference opinion manner spell opinion term french study comprise such exercise short poem tale calculate afford insight intricacy gallic tongue

39,"""I have no intention of becoming a mere bookworm, and, on the contrary, we have had one excessively brisk and pleasant game at football already this season, and should, but for the unfortunate inclemency of the weather, have engaged again this afternoon in the mimic warfare.",have intention become mere bookworm contrary have brisk pleasant game football season unfortunate inclemency weather engage afternoon mimic warfare 
40,"""In the playground our favourite diversion is the game of 'chevy,' so called from the engagement famed in ballad and history (I allude to the battle of Chevy Chase), and indeed, my dear parents, in the rapid alternations of its fortunes and the diversity of its incident, the game (to my mind) bears a striking resemblance to the accounts of that ever-memorable contest.",playground favourite diversion game call engagement famed ballad history allude battle dear parent rapid alternation fortune diversity incident game mind bear strike resemblance account memorable contest 
41,"""I fear I must now relinquish my pen, as the time allotted for correspondence is fast waning to its close, and tea-time is approaching.

43,"""And now, my dear parents, believe me, your dutiful and affectionate son, so and so.""",dear parent believe dutiful affectionate son 
44,"The Doctor finished his dictation with a roll in his voice, as much as to say, ""I think that will strike your respective parents as a chaste and classical composition; I think so!""",finish dictation roll voice say think strike respective parent chaste classical composition think 
45,"But unexceptionable as its tone and sentiments undoubtedly were, it was far from expressing the feelings of Mr. Bultitude. The rest accepted it not unwillingly as an escape from the fatigue of original composition, but to him the neat, well-balanced sentences seemed a hollow mockery. As he wrote down each successive phrase, he wondered what Dick would think of it, and when at last it was finished, the precious hour had gone for another week!",unexceptionable tone sentiment express feeling rest accept escape fatigue original composition neat balance sentence seem hollow mockery write successive phrase wonder think last finish precious hour go week 
46,"In speechless disgust but without protest, for his spirit was too broken by this last cruel disappointment, he had to fold, put into an envelope and direct this most misleading letter under the Doctor's superintending eye, which of course allowed him no chance of introducing a line or even a word to counteract the tone of self-satisfaction and contentment which breathed in every sentence of it.",speechless disgust protest spirit break last cruel disappointment have fold put envelope direct misleading letter superintend eye course allow chance introduce line word counteract tone self satisfaction contentment breathe sentence 
47,"He saw it stamped, and put into the postbag, and then his last gleam of hope flickered out; he must give up struggling against the Inevitable; he must resign himself to be educated, and perhaps flogged here, while Dick was filling his house with clowns and pantaloons, destroying his reputation and damaging his credit at home. Perhaps, in course of time, he would grow accustomed to it, and, meanwhile, he would be as careful as possible to do and say nothing to make himself remarkable in any way, by which means he trusted, at least, to avoid any fresh calamity.",see stamp put postbag last gleam hope flicker give struggle inevitable resign educate flogge fill house clown pantaloon destroy reputation damage credit home course time grow accustom careful possible do say make remarkable way mean trust least avoid fresh calamity
