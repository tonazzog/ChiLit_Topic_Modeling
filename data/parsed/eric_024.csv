3,"Eric and Wildney were flogged and confined to gates for a time instead of being expelled, and they both bore the punishment in a manly and penitent way, and set themselves with all their might to repair the injury which their characters had received. Eric, especially, seemed to be devoting himself with every energy to regain, if possible, his long lost position, and by the altered complexion of his remaining school-life, to atone in some poor measure for its earlier sins. And he carried Wildney with him, influencing others also of his late companions in a greater or less degree. It was not Eric's nature to do things by halves, and it became obvious to all that his exertions to resist and abandon his old temptations were strenuous and unwavering. He could no longer hope for the school distinctions, which would have once lain so easily within his reach, for the ground lost during weeks of idleness cannot be recovered by a wish; but he succeeded sufficiently, by dint of desperately hard work, to acquit himself with considerable credit, and in the Easter examination came out sufficiently high, to secure his remove into the sixth form after the holidays.",flogge confine gate time expel bear punishment manly penitent way set might repair injury character receive seem devote energy regain possible long lose position alter complexion remain school life atone poor measure early sin carry influence other late companion great less degree nature do thing half become obvious exertion resist abandon old temptation strenuous unwavering hope school distinction lain reach ground lose week idleness recover wish succeed dint hard work acquit considerable credit examination come high secure remove sixth form holiday 
4,"He felt far happier in the endeavor to fulfill his duty, than he had ever done during the last years of recklessness and neglect, and the change for the better in his character tended to restore unanimity and good will to the school. Eric no longer headed the party which made a point of ridiculing and preventing industry; and, sharing as he did the sympathy of nearly all the boys, he was able quietly and unobtrusively to calm down the jealousies and allay the heartburnings which had for so long a time brought discord and disunion into the school society. Cheerfulness and unanimity began to prevail once more at Roslyn, and Eric had the intense happiness of seeing how much good lay still within his power.",feel happy endeavor fulfill duty do last year recklessness neglect change good character tend restore unanimity good will school head party make point ridicule prevent industry sharing do sympathy boy able calm jealousy allay heartburning have time bring discord disunion school society cheerfulness unanimity begin prevail more have intense happiness see much good lay power 
5,"So the Easter holidays commenced with promise, and the few first days glided away in innocent enjoyments. Eric was now reconciled again to Owen and Duncan, and, therefore, had a wider choice of companions more truly congenial to his high nature than the narrow circle of his late associates.",holiday commence promise few first day glide innocent enjoyment reconcile have wide choice companion congenial high nature narrow circle late associate 
6,"""What do you say to a boat excursion to-morrow?"" asked Duncan, as they chatted together one evening.",say boat excursion ask chate evening

10,"""Never mind. Bring him with you, and Graham too, if you like.""",mind bring like 
11,"""Most gladly,"" said Eric, really pleased; for he saw by this that Duncan observed the improvement in his old friends, and was falling in with the endeavor to make all the boys really cordial to each other, and destroy all traces of the late factions.",say pleased see observe improvement old friend fall endeavor make boy cordial other destroy trace late faction 
12,"""Do you mind my bringing Montagu?""",mind bring 
13,"""Not at all. Why should I?"" answered Eric, with a slight blush. Montagu and he had never been formally reconciled, nor had they, as yet, spoken to each other. Indeed Duncan had purposely planned the excursion to give them an opportunity of becoming friends once more, by being thrown together. He knew well that they both earnestly wished it, although, with the natural shyness of boys, they hardly knew how to set about effecting it. Montagu hung back lest he should seem to be patronising a fallen enemy, and Eric lest he should have sinned too deeply to be forgiven.",answer slight blush reconcile speak other plan excursion give opportunity become friend more throw know wish natural shyness boy know set effect hang seem patronise fall enemy sinn forgive 
14,"The next morning dawned gloriously, and it was agreed that they should meet at Starhaven, the point where they were to get the boat, at ten o'clock. As they had supposed, Dr. Rowlands gave a ready consent to the row, on condition of their being accompanied by the experienced sailor whom the boys called Jim. The precaution was by no means unnecessary, for the various currents which ran round the island were violent at certain stages of the tide, and extremely dangerous for any who were not aware of their general course.",next morning dawn agree meet point get boat o'clock suppose give ready consent row condition accompany experienced sailor boy call precaution means unnecessary various current run island violent certain stage tide dangerous aware general course 
15,"Feeling that the day would pass off very unpleasantly if any feeling of restraint remained between him and Montagu, Eric, by a strong effort, determined to ""make up with him"" before starting, and went into his study for that purpose after breakfast. Directly he came in, Montagu jumped up and welcomed him cordially, and when, without any allusion to the past, the two shook hands with all warmth, and looked the old proud look into each other's faces, they felt once more that their former affection was unimpaired, and that in heart they were real and loving friends. Most keenly did they both enjoy the renewed intercourse, and they found endless subjects to talk about on their way to Starhaven, where the others were already assembled when they came.",feel day pass feeling restraint remain strong effort determined make start go study purpose breakfast come jump welcome allusion past shake hand warmth look old proud look other face feel more former affection unimpaired heart real loving friend enjoy renew intercourse find endless subject talk way other assemble come 
16,"With Jim's assistance they shoved a boat into the water, and sprang into it in the highest spirits. Just as they were pushing off they saw Wright and Vernon running down to the shore towards them, and they waited to see what they wanted. ""Couldn't you take us with you?"" asked Vernon, breathless with his run.",assistance shove boat water spring high spirit push see run shore wait see want take ask breathless run

22,"""Well, good bye, then; off we go;"" and with light hearts the boaters and the pedestrians parted.",good bye go light heart boater pedestrian part 
23,"Eric, Graham, Duncan, and Montagu took the first turn at the oars, while Wildney steered. Graham's ""crabs,"" and Wildney's rather crooked steering, gave plenty of opportunity for chaff, and they were full of fun as the oar-blades splashed and sparkled in the waves. Then they made Jim sing them some of his old sailor songs as they rowed, and joined vigorously in the choruses. They had arranged to make straight for St. Catherine's Head, and land somewhere near it to choose a place for their pic-nic. It took them nearly two hours to get there, as they rowed leisurely, and enjoyed the luxury of the vernal air. It was one of the sunniest days of early spring; the air was pure and delicious, and the calm sea breeze, just strong enough to make the sea flame and glister in the warm sunlight, was exhilarating as new wine. Underneath them the water was transparent as crystal, and far below they could see the green and purple sea-weeds rising like a many-colored wood, through which occasionally they saw a fish, startled by their oars, dart like an arrow. The sky overhead was a cloudless blue, and as they kept not far from shore, the clearly cut outline of the coast, with its rocks and hills standing out in the vivid atmosphere, made a glowing picture, to which the golden green of the spring herbage, bathed in its morning sunlight, lent the magic of enchantment. Who could have been otherwise than happy in such a scene and at such a time? but these were boys with the long bright holiday before them, and happiness is almost too quiet a word to express the bounding exultation of heart, the royal and tingling sense of vigorous life, which made them shout and sing, as their boat rustled through the ripples, from a mere instinct of inexpressible enjoyment.",take first turn oar steer crab crooked steering give plenty opportunity chaff full fun oar blade splash sparkle wave make sing old sailor song row join choruse arrange make land choose place pic-nic take hour get row enjoy luxury vernal air sunniest day early spring air pure delicious calm sea breeze strong make sea flame glister warm sunlight exhilarate new wine water transparent crystal see green purple sea weed rise many color wood see fish startle oar dart arrow sky overhead cloudless blue keep shore cut outline coast rock hill stand vivid atmosphere make glow picture golden green spring herbage bath morning sunlight loan magic enchantment happy scene time boy long bright holiday happiness quiet word express bounding exultation heart royal tingle sense vigorous life make shout sing boat rustle ripple mere instinct inexpressible enjoyment 
24,"They had each contributed some luxury to the pic-nic, and it made a very tempting display as they spread it out, under a sunny pebbled cave, by St. Catherine's Head; although, instead of anything more objectionable, they had thought it best to content themselves with a very moderate quantity of beer. When they had done eating, they amused themselves on the shore; and had magnificent games among the rocks, and in every fantastic nook of the romantic promontory. And then Eric suggested a bathe to wind up with, as it was the first day when it had been quite warm enough to make bathing pleasant.",contribute luxury pic-nic make tempting display spread sunny pebble cave objectionable think good content moderate quantity beer do eat amuse shore have magnificent game rock fantastic nook romantic promontory suggest bathe wind first day warm make bathing pleasant 
25,"""But we've got no towels.""",get towel 
26,"""Oh! chance the towels. We can run about till we're dry."" So they bathed, and then getting in the boat to row back again, they all agreed that it was the very jolliest day they'd ever had at Roslyn, and voted to renew the experiment before the holidays were over, and take Wright and Vernon with them in a larger boat.",chance towel run dry bath get boat row agree jolliest day have vote renew experiment holiday take large boat 
27,"It was afternoon,--and afternoon still warm and beautiful,--when they began to row home; so they took it quietly, and kept near the land for variety's sake, laughing, joking, and talking as merrily as ever.",afternoon afternoon warm beautiful begin row take keep land variety sake laugh joke talk 
28,"""I declare I think this is the prettiest or anyhow the grandest bit of the whole coast,"" said Eric, as they neared a glen through whose narrow gorge a green and garrulous little river gambolled down with noisy turbulence into the sea. He might well admire that glen; its steep and rugged sides were veiled with lichens, moss, and wild-flowers, and the sea-birds found safe refuge in its lonely windings, which were colored with topaz and emerald by the pencillings of nature and the rich stains of time.",declare think prettiest grandest bit whole coast say near glen narrow gorge green garrulous little river gamboll noisy turbulence sea admire glen steep rugged side veil lichen moss wild flower sea bird find safe refuge lonely winding color topaz emerald pencilling nature rich stain time 
29,"""Yes,"" answered Montagu, ""_I_ always stick up for Avon Glen as the finest scene we've got about here. But, I say, who's that gesticulating on the rock there to the right of it? I verily believe it's Wright, apostrophising the ocean for Vernon's benefit. I only see one of them though.""",answer stick fine scene get say gesticulate rock right believe apostrophise ocean benefit see

33,"""What do you say to putting in to shore there?"" said Duncan; ""it's only two miles to Starhaven, and I dare say we could make shift to take them in for that distance. If Jim says anything we'll chuck him overboard.""",say put shore say mile say make shift take distance say chuck 
34,"They rowed towards Avon Glen, and to their surprise Wright, who stood there alone (for with a pocket telescope they clearly made out that it _was_ Wright), still continued to wave his arms and beckon them in a manner which they at first thought ridiculous, but which soon make them feel rather uneasy. Jim took an oar, and they soon got within two hundred yards of the beach. Wright had ceased to make signals, but appeared to be shouting to them, and pointing towards one corner of the glen; but though they caught the sound of his voice they could not hear what he said.",row surprise stand pocket telescope make continue wave arm beckon manner think ridiculous make feel uneasy take oar get yard beach cease make signal appear shouting point corner glen catch sound voice hear say

38,"""O _do_ let me look,"" said Eric.",let look say 
39,"""No! stop, stop, Eric, you'd better not, I think; pray don't, it may be all a mistake. You'd better not--but it looked--nay, you really _mustn't,_ Eric,"" he said, and, as if accidentally, he let the telescope fall into the water, and they saw it sink down among the seaweeds at the bottom.",stop stop think pray mistake look _must say let telescope fall water see sink seaweed bottom 
40,"Eric looked at him reproachfully. ""What's the fun of that, Monty? you let it drop on purpose.""",look fun let drop purpose 
41,"""O never mind; I'll get Wildney another. I really daren't let you look, for fear you should _fancy_ the same as I did, for it must be fancy. O _don't_ let us put in there--at least not all of us.""",mind get let look fear _fancy same fancy let put least 
42,"What _was_ that thing in the water?--When Wright and Vernon left the others, they walked along the coast, following the direction of the boat, and agreed to amuse themselves in collecting eggs. They were very successful, and, to their great delight, managed to secure some rather rare specimens. When they had tired themselves with this pursuit, they lay on the summit of one of the cliffs which formed the sides of Avon Glen, and Wright, who was very fond of poetry, read Vernon a canto of Marmion with great enthusiasm.",thing water leave other walk coast follow direction boat agree amuse collect egg successful great delight manage secure rare specimen tired pursuit lay summit cliff form side fond poetry read canto great enthusiasm 
43,"So they whiled away the morning, and when the canto was over, Vernon took a great stone and rolled it for amusement over the cliff's edge. It thundered over the side, bounding down till it reached the strand, and a large black cormorant, startled by the reverberating echoes, rose up suddenly, and flapped its way with protruded neck to a rock on the further side of the little bay.",whil morning canto take great stone roll amusement cliff edge thunder side bound reach strand large black cormorant startle reverberate echo rise flapp way protrude neck rock further side little bay

45,"They got up, and looking down the face of the cliff, saw, some eight feet below them, a projection half hidden by the branch of a tree, on which the scattered pieces of stick clearly showed the existence of a rude nest. They could not, however, see whether it contained eggs or no.",get look face cliff see foot projection half hide branch tree scatter piece stick show existence rude nest see contain egg 
46,"""I must bag that nest; it's pretty sure to have eggs in it,"" said Vernon, ""and I can get at it easy enough."" He immediately began to descend towards the place where the nest was built, but he found it harder than he expected.",bag nest sure have egg say get easy begin descend place nest build find hard expect 
47,"""Hallo,"" he said, ""this is a failure. I must climb up again to reconnoitre if there isn't a better dodge for getting at it."" He reached the top, and, looking down, saw a plan of reaching the ledge which promised more hope of success.",say failure climb reconnoitre be good dodge get reach top look see plan reach ledge promise more hope success

49,"""O no, Wright, never say die. Look; if I get down more towards the right the way's plain enough, and I shall have reached the nest in no time.""

53,"""O no, not a bit of it. My head's very steady, and I feel as cool as possible. We mustn't give up; I've only to get at the tree, and then I shall be able to reach the nest from it quite easily.""",bit head steady feel cool possible give get tree able reach nest 
54,"""Well, do take care, that's a dear fellow.""",take care dear fellow 
55,"""Never fear,"" said Vernon, who was already commencing his third attempt. This time he got to the tree, and placed his foot on a part of the root, while with his hands he clung on to a clump of heather. ""Hurrah!"" he cried, ""it's got two eggs in it, Wright;"" and he stretched downwards to take them. Just as he was doing so, he heard the root on which his foot rested give a great crack, and with a violent start he made a spring for one of the lower branches. The motion caused his whole weight to rest for an instant on his arms;--unable to sustain the wrench, the heather gave way, and with a wild shriek he fell headlong down the surface of the cliff.",fear say commence third attempt time get tree place foot part root hand cling clump heather cry get egg stretch take do hear root foot rest give great crack violent start make spring low branch motion cause whole weight rest instant arm unable sustain wrench heather give way wild shriek fall surface cliff

57,"""Vernon! Vernon!"" shouted the terrified Wright, creeping close up to the edge of the precipice. ""O Vernon! for heaven's sake speak!""",shout terrify creep edge precipice heaven sake speak 
58,"There was no answer, and leaning over, Wright saw the young boy outstretched on the stones three hundred feet below. For some minutes he was horrorstruck beyond expression, and made wild attempts to descend the cliff and reach him. But he soon gave up the attempt in despair. There was a tradition in the school that the feat had once been accomplished by an adventurous and active boy, but Wright at any rate found it hopeless for himself. The only other way to reach the glen was by a circuitous route which led to the entrance of the narrow gorge, along the sides of which it was possible to make way with difficulty down the bank of the river to the place where it met the sea. But this would have taken him an hour and a half, and was far from easy when the river was swollen with high tide. Nor was there any house within some distance at which assistance could be procured, and Wright, in a tumult of conflicting emotions, determined to wait where he was, on the chance of seeing the boat as it returned from St. Catherine's Head. It was already three o'clock, and he knew that they could not now be longer than an hour at most; so with eager eyes he sat watching the headland, round which he knew they would first come in sight. He watched with wild eager eyes, absorbed in the one longing desire to catch sight of them; but the leaden-footed moments crawled on like hours, and he could not help shivering with agony and fear. At last he caught a glimpse of them, and springing up, began to shout at the top of his voice, and wave his handkerchief and his arms in the hope of attracting their attention. Little thought those blithe merry-hearted boys in the midst of the happy laughter which they sent ringing over the waters, little they thought how terrible a tragedy awaited them.",be answer lean see young boy outstretch stone foot minute horrorstruck expression make wild attempt descend cliff reach give attempt despair be tradition school feat accomplish adventurous active boy rate find hopeless only other way reach glen circuitous route lead entrance narrow gorge side possible make way difficulty bank river place meet sea take hour half easy river swollen high tide be house distance assistance procure tumult conflict emotion determine wait chance see boat return o'clock know long hour most eager eye sit watch headland know come sight watch wild eager eye absorb long desire catch sight leaden footed moment crawl hour help shiver agony fear last catch glimpse spring begin shout top voice wave handkerchief arm hope attract attention little think blithe merry hearted boy midst happy laughter send ring water little think terrible tragedy await 
59,"At last Wright saw that they had perceived him, and were putting inland, and now, in his fright, he hardly knew what to do; but feeling sure that they could not fail to see Vernon, he ran off as fast as he could to Starhaven, where he rapidly told the people at a farm-house what had happened, and asked them to get a cart ready to convey the wounded boy to Roslyn school.",last see perceive put fright know do feel sure fail see run tell person farm house happen ask get cart ready convey wound boy school 
60,"Meanwhile the tide rolled in calmly and quietly in the rosy evening, radiant with the diamond and gold of reflected sunlight and transparent wave. Gradually gently it crept up to the place where Vernon lay; and the little ripples fell over him wonderingly, with the low murmur of their musical laughter, and blurred and dimmed the vivid splashes and crimson streaks upon the white stone on which his head had fallen, and washed away some of the purple bells and green sprigs of heather round which his fingers were closed in the grasp of death, and played softly with his fair hair as it rose, and fell, and floated on their undulations like a leaf of golden-colored weed, until they themselves were faintly discolored by his blood. And then, tired with their new plaything, they passed on, until the swelling of the water was just strong enough to move rudely the boy's light weight, and in a few moments more would have tossed it up and down with every careless wave among the boulders of the glen. And then it was that Montagu's horror-stricken gaze had identified the object at which they had been gazing. In strange foreboding silence they urged on the boat, while Eric at the prow seemed wild with the one intense impulse to verify his horrible suspicion. The suspicion grew and grew:--it _was_ a boy lying in the water;--it was Vernon;--he was motionless;--he must have fallen there from the cliff.",tide roll rosy evening radiant diamond gold reflect sunlight transparent wave creep place lay little ripple fall low murmur musical laughter blur dimm vivid splashe crimson streak white stone head fall wash purple bell green sprig heather finger close grasp death play fair hair rise fall float undulation leaf golden color weed discolor blood tired new plaything pass swell water strong move boy light weight few moment more toss careless wave boulder glen horror stricken gaze identify object gaze strange foreboding silence urge boat prow seem wild intense impulse verify horrible suspicion suspicion grow grow boy lie water motionless fall cliff 
61,"Eric could endure the suspense no longer. The instant that the boat grated on the shingle, he sprang into the water, and rushed to the spot where his brother's body lay. With a burst of passionate affection, he flung himself on his knees beside it, and took the cold hand in his own--the little rigid hand in which the green blades of grass, and fern, and heath, so tightly clutched, were unconscious of the tale they told.",endure suspense instant boat grate shingle spring water rush spot brother body lay burst passionate affection flung knee take cold hand own little rigid hand green blade grass fern heath clutch unconscious tale tell 
62,"""Oh Verny, Verny, darling Verny, speak to me!"" he cried in anguish, as he tenderly lifted up the body, and marked how little blood had flowed. But the child's head fell back heavily, and his arms hung motionless beside him, and with a shriek, Eric suddenly caught the look of dead fixity in his blue open eyes.",speak cry anguish lift body mark little blood flow child head fall arm hang motionless shriek catch look dead fixity blue open eye 
63,"The others had come up. ""O God, save my brother, save him, save him from death,"" cried Eric, ""I cannot live without him. Oh God! Oh God! Look! look!"" he continued, ""he has fallen from the cliff with his head on this cursed stone,"" pointing to the block of quartz, still red with blood-stained hair; ""but we must get a doctor. He is not dead! no, no, no, he _cannot_ be dead. Take him quickly, and let us row home. Oh God! why did I ever leave him?""",other come save brother save save death cry live look look continue fall cliff head curse stone point block quartz red blood stain hair get doctor dead dead take let row leave 
64,"The boys drew round in a frightened circle, and lifted Vernon's corpse into the boat; and then, while Eric still supported the body, and moaned, and called to him in anguish, and chafed his cold pale brow and white hands, and kept saying that he had fainted and was not dead, the others rowed home with all speed, while a feeling of terrified anxiety lay like frost upon their hearts.",boy draw frighten circle lift corpse boat support body moan call anguish chafe cold pale brow white hand keep say faint dead other row speed feeling terrified anxiety lay frost heart 
65,"They reached Starhaven, and got into the cart with the lifeless boy, and heard from Wright how the accident had taken place. Few boys were about the play-ground, so they got unnoticed to Roslyn, and Dr. Underhay, who had been summoned, was instantly in attendance. He looked at Vernon for a moment, and then shook his head in a way that could not be mistaken. Eric saw it, and flung himself with uncontrollable agony on his brother's corpse. ""O Vernon, Vernon, my own dear brother! oh God, then he is dead."" And, unable to endure the blow, he fainted away.",reach get cart lifeless boy hear accident take place few boy play ground get unnoticed summon attendance look moment shake head way mistaken see flung uncontrollable agony brother corpse own dear brother dead unable endure blow faint 
66,"I cannot dwell on the miserable days that followed, when the very sun in heaven seemed dark to poor Eric's wounded and crushed spirit. He hardly knew how they went by. And when they buried Vernon in the little green churchyard by Russell's side, and the patter of the earth upon the coffin--that most terrible of all sounds--struck his ear, the iron entered into his soul, and he had but one wish as he turned away from the open grave, and that was, soon to lie beside his beloved little brother and to be at rest.",dwell miserable day follow very sun heaven seem dark poor wound crush spirit know go bury little green churchyard side patter earth coffin terrible sound strike ear iron enter soul have wish turn open grave lie beloved little brother rest
