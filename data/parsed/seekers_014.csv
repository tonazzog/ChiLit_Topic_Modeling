1,CHAPTER 14. THE DIVINING-ROD,divining rod 
2,"You have no idea how uncomfortable the house was on the day when we sought for gold with the divining-rod. It was like a spring-cleaning in the winter-time. All the carpets were up, because Father had told Eliza to make the place decent as there was a gentleman coming to dinner the next day. So she got in a charwoman, and they slopped water about, and left brooms and brushes on the stairs for people to tumble over. H. O. got a big bump on his head in that way, and when he said it was too bad, Eliza said he should keep in the nursery then, and not be where he’d no business. We bandaged his head with a towel, and then he stopped crying and played at being England’s wounded hero dying in the cockpit, while every man was doing his duty, as the hero had told them to, and Alice was Hardy, and I was the doctor, and the others were the crew. Playing at Hardy made us think of our own dear robber, and we wished he was there, and wondered if we should ever see him any more.",have idea uncomfortable house day seek gold divining rod spring cleaning winter time carpet tell make place decent be gentleman come dinner next day get charwoman sloppe water leave broom brush stair person tumble get big bump head way say bad say keep nursery would business bandage head towel stop cry play wound hero die cockpit man do duty hero tell doctor other crew play make think own dear robber wish wonder see more 
3,"We were rather astonished at Father’s having anyone to dinner, because now he never seems to think of anything but business. Before Mother died people often came to dinner, and Father’s business did not take up so much of his time and was not the bother it is now. And we used to see who could go furthest down in our nightgowns and get nice things to eat, without being seen, out of the dishes as they came out of the dining-room. Eliza can’t cook very nice things. She told Father she was a good plain cook, but he says it was a fancy portrait. We stayed in the nursery till the charwoman came in and told us to be off--she was going to make one job of it, and have our carpet up as well as all the others, now the man was here to beat them. It came up, and it was very dusty--and under it we found my threepenny-bit that I lost ages ago, which shows what Eliza is. H. O. had got tired of being the wounded hero, and Dicky was so tired of doing nothing that Dora said she knew he’d begin to tease Noel in a minute; then of course Dicky said he wasn’t going to tease anybody--he was going out to the Heath. He said he’d heard that nagging women drove a man from his home, and now he found it was quite true. Oswald always tries to be a peacemaker, so he told Dicky to shut up and not make an ass of himself. And Alice said, ‘Well, Dora began’--And Dora tossed her chin up and said it wasn’t any business of Oswald’s any way, and no one asked Alice’s opinion. So we all felt very uncomfortable till Noel said, ‘Don’t let’s quarrel about nothing. You know let dogs delight--and I made up another piece while you were talking--",astonished have dinner seem think business die person come dinner business take much time bother use see go nightgown get nice thing eat see dish come dining room cook nice thing tell good plain cook say fancy portrait stay nursery charwoman come tell go make job have carpet other man beat come dusty find threepenny bit lose age show get tired wound hero tired do say know begin tease minute course say go tease go say hear nagg woman drive man home find true try peacemaker tell shut make ass say begin toss chin say business way ask opinion feel uncomfortable say let quarrel know let dog delight make piece talk

5,"We all laughed then and stopped jawing at each other. Noel is very funny with his poetry. But that piece happened to come out quite true. You begin to quarrel and then you can’t stop; often, long before the others are ready to cry and make it up, I see how silly it is, and I want to laugh; but it doesn’t do to say so--for it only makes the others crosser than they were before. I wonder why that is?",laugh stop jaw other funny poetry piece happen come true begin quarrel stop other ready cry make see silly want laugh do say make other crosser wonder 
6,"Alice said Noel ought to be poet laureate, and she actually went out in the cold and got some laurel leaves--the spotted kind--out of the garden, and Dora made a crown and we put it on him. He was quite pleased; but the leaves made a mess, and Eliza said, ‘Don’t.’ I believe that’s a word grown-ups use more than any other. Then suddenly Alice thought of that old idea of hers for finding treasure, and she said--‘Do let’s try the divining-rod.’",say poet laureate go cold get laurel leave spot kind garden make crown put pleased leave make mess say believe word grow up use more other think old idea find treasure say let try divining rod 
7,"So Oswald said, ‘Fair priestess, we do greatly desire to find gold beneath our land, therefore we pray thee practise with the divining-rod, and tell us where we can find it.’",say fair priestess desire find gold land pray practise divining rod tell find 
8,‘Do ye desire to fashion of it helms and hauberks?’ said Alice.,desire fashion helm hauberk say 
9,"‘Yes,’ said Noel; ‘and chains and ouches.’",say chain ouche 
10,"‘I bet you don’t know what an “ouch” is,’ said Dicky.",bet know ouch say 
11,"‘Yes I do, so there!’ said Noel. ‘It’s a carcanet. I looked it out in the dicker, now then!’ We asked him what a carcanet was, but he wouldn’t say.",say carcanet look dicker ask carcanet say 
12,"‘And we want to make fair goblets of the gold,’ said Oswald.",want make fair goblet gold say 
13,"‘Yes, to drink coconut milk out of,’ said H. O.",drink coconut milk say 
14,"‘And we desire to build fair palaces of it,’ said Dicky.",desire build fair palace say 
15,"‘And to buy things,’ said Dora; ‘a great many things. New Sunday frocks and hats and kid gloves and--’",buy thing say great many thing new frock hat kid glove 
16,She would have gone on for ever so long only we reminded her that we hadn’t found the gold yet.,go remind find gold 
17,"By this Alice had put on the nursery tablecloth, which is green, and tied the old blue and yellow antimacassar over her head, and she said--",put nursery tablecloth green tie old blue yellow antimacassar head say 
18,"‘If your intentions are correct, fear nothing and follow me.’",intention correct fear follow 
19,"And she went down into the hall. We all followed chanting ‘Heroes.’ It is a gloomy thing the girls learnt at the High School, and we always use it when we want a priestly chant.",go hall follow chant heroe gloomy thing girl learn high use want priestly chant 
20,"Alice stopped short by the hat-stand, and held up her hands as well as she could for the tablecloth, and said--",stop short hat stand hold hand tablecloth say 
21,"‘Now, great altar of the golden idol, yield me the divining-rod that I may use it for the good of the suffering people.’",great altar golden idol yield divining rod use good suffering person 
22,"The umbrella-stand was the altar of the golden idol, and it yielded her the old school umbrella. She carried it between her palms.",umbrella stand altar golden idol yield old school umbrella carry palm 
23,"‘Now,’ she said, ‘I shall sing the magic chant. You mustn’t say anything, but just follow wherever I go--like follow my leader, you know--and when there is gold underneath the magic rod will twist in the hand of the priestess like a live thing that seeks to be free. Then you will dig, and the golden treasure will be revealed. H. O., if you make that clatter with your boots they’ll come and tell us not to. Now come on all of you.’",say sing magic chant say follow go follow leader know be gold magic rod twist hand priestess live thing seek free dig golden treasure reveal make clatter boot come tell come 
24,"So she went upstairs and down and into every room. We followed her on tiptoe, and Alice sang as she went. What she sang is not out of a book--Noel made it up while she was dressing up for the priestess.",go room follow tiptoe sing go sing book make dress priestess 
25,"    Ashen rod cold     That here I hold,     Teach me where to find the gold.",rod cold hold teach find gold 
26,"When we came to where Eliza was, she said, ‘Get along with you’; but Dora said it was only a game, and we wouldn’t touch anything, and our boots were quite clean, and Eliza might as well let us. So she did.",come say get say game touch boot clean let 
27,"It was all right for the priestess, but it was a little dull for the rest of us, because she wouldn’t let us sing, too; so we said we’d had enough of it, and if she couldn’t find the gold we’d leave off and play something else. The priestess said, ‘All right, wait a minute,’ and went on singing. Then we all followed her back into the nursery, where the carpet was up and the boards smelt of soft soap. Then she said, ‘It moves, it moves! Once more the choral hymn!’ So we sang ‘Heroes’ again, and in the middle the umbrella dropped from her hands.",right priestess little dull rest let sing say have enough find gold leave play else priestess say right wait minute go sing follow nursery carpet board smell soft soap say move move choral hymn sing middle umbrella drop hand 
28,"‘The magic rod has spoken,’ said Alice; ‘dig here, and that with courage and despatch.’ We didn’t quite see how to dig, but we all began to scratch on the floor with our hands, but the priestess said, ‘Don’t be so silly! It’s the place where they come to do the gas. The board’s loose. Dig an you value your lives, for ere sundown the dragon who guards this spoil will return in his fiery fury and make you his unresisting prey.’",magic rod speak say dig courage despatch see dig begin scratch floor hand priestess say silly place come do gas board loose dig value life sundown dragon guard spoil return fiery fury make unresist prey 
29,"So we dug--that is, we got the loose board up. And Alice threw up her arms and cried--",dig get loose board throw arm cry 
30,"‘See the rich treasure--the gold in thick layers, with silver and diamonds stuck in it!’",see rich treasure gold thick layer silver diamond stick 
31,"‘Like currants in cake,’ said H. O.",like currant cake say 
32,"‘It’s a lovely treasure,’ said Dicky yawning. ‘Let’s come back and carry it away another day.’",lovely treasure say yawn let come carry day 
33,But Alice was kneeling by the hole.,kneel hole 
34,"‘Let me feast my eyes on the golden splendour,’ she said, ‘hidden these long centuries from the human eye. Behold how the magic rod has led us to treasures more--Oswald, don’t push so!--more bright than ever monarch--I say, there _is_ something down there, really. I saw it shine!’",let feast eye golden splendour say hide long century human eye magic rod lead treasure push bright monarch say see shine 
35,"We thought she was kidding, but when she began to try to get into the hole, which was much too small, we saw she meant it, so I said, ‘Let’s have a squint,’ and I looked, but I couldn’t see anything, even when I lay down on my stomach. The others lay down on their stomachs too and tried to see, all but Noel, who stood and looked at us and said we were the great serpents come down to drink at the magic pool. He wanted to be the knight and slay the great serpents with his good sword--he even drew the umbrella ready--but Alice said, ‘All right, we will in a minute. But now--I’m sure I saw it; do get a match, Noel, there’s a dear.’",think kid begin try get hole small see mean say let have squint look see lay stomach other lay stomach try see stand look say great serpent come drink magic pool want knight slay great serpent good sword draw umbrella ready say right minute sure see get match be dear 
36,"‘What did you see?’ asked Noel, beginning to go for the matches very slowly.",see ask begin go match 
37,"‘Something bright, away in the corner under the board against the beam.’",bright corner board beam 
38,"‘Perhaps it was a rat’s eye,’ Noel said, ‘or a snake’s,’ and we did not put our heads quite so close to the hole till he came back with the matches.",rat eye say snake put head close hole come match 
39,"Then I struck a match, and Alice cried, ‘There it is!’ And there it was, and it was a half-sovereign, partly dusty and partly bright. We think perhaps a mouse, disturbed by the carpets being taken up, may have brushed the dust of years from part of the half-sovereign with his tail. We can’t imagine how it came there, only Dora thinks she remembers once when H. O. was very little Mother gave him some money to hold, and he dropped it, and it rolled all over the floor. So we think perhaps this was part of it. We were very glad. H. O. wanted to go out at once and buy a mask he had seen for fourpence. It had been a shilling mask, but now it was going very cheap because Guy Fawkes’ Day was over, and it was a little cracked at the top. But Dora said, ‘I don’t know that it’s our money. Let’s wait and ask Father.’",strike match cry be be half sovereign dusty bright think mouse disturb carpet take brush dust year part half sovereign tail imagine come think remember little mother give money hold drop roll floor think part glad want go buy mask see fourpence shilling mask go cheap day little crack top say know money let wait ask father 
40,"But H. O. did not care about waiting, and I felt for him. Dora is rather like grown-ups in that way; she does not seem to understand that when you want a thing you do want it, and that you don’t wish to wait, even a minute.",care wait feel grow up way seem understand want thing want wish wait minute 
41,"So we went and asked Albert-next-door’s uncle. He was pegging away at one of the rotten novels he has to write to make his living, but he said we weren’t interrupting him at all.",go ask next door uncle pegg rotten novel have write make living say interrupt 
42,"‘My hero’s folly has involved him in a difficulty,’ he said. ‘It is his own fault. I will leave him to meditate on the incredible fatuity--the hare-brained recklessness--which have brought him to this pass. It will be a lesson to him. I, meantime, will give myself unreservedly to the pleasures of your conversation.’",hero folly involve difficulty say own fault leave meditate incredible fatuity hare brain recklessness bring pass lesson meantime give pleasure conversation 
43,"That’s one thing I like Albert’s uncle for. He always talks like a book, and yet you can always understand what he means. I think he is more like us, inside of his mind, than most grown-up people are. He can pretend beautifully. I never met anyone else so good at it, except our robber, and we began it, with him. But it was Albert’s uncle who first taught us how to make people talk like books when you’re playing things, and he made us learn to tell a story straight from the beginning, not starting in the middle like most people do. So now Oswald remembered what he had been told, as he generally does, and began at the beginning, but when he came to where Alice said she was the priestess, Albert’s uncle said--",thing like uncle talk book understand mean think more mind grow person pretend meet else good robber begin uncle teach make person talk book play thing make learn tell story beginning start middle most person remember tell begin beginning come say priestess uncle say 
44,‘Let the priestess herself set forth the tale in fitting speech.’,let priestess set tale fitting speech 
45,"So Alice said, ‘O high priest of the great idol, the humblest of thy slaves took the school umbrella for a divining-rod, and sang the song of inver--what’s-it’s-name?’",say high priest great idol humblest slave take school umbrella divining rod sing song name 
46,"‘Invocation perhaps?’ said Albert’s uncle. ‘Yes; and then I went about and about and the others got tired, so the divining-rod fell on a certain spot, and I said, “Dig”, and we dug--it was where the loose board is for the gas men--and then there really and truly was a half-sovereign lying under the boards, and here it is.’",invocation say uncle go other get tired divining rod fall certain spot say dig dig loose board gas man half sovereign lie board 
47,Albert’s uncle took it and looked at it.,uncle take look 
48,"‘The great high priest will bite it to see if it’s good,’ he said, and he did. ‘I congratulate you,’ he went on; ‘you are indeed among those favoured by the Immortals. First you find half-crowns in the garden, and now this. The high priest advises you to tell your Father, and ask if you may keep it. My hero has become penitent, but impatient. I must pull him out of this scrape. Ye have my leave to depart.’",great high priest bite see good say congratulate go favour find half crown garden high priest advise tell father ask keep hero become penitent impatient pull scrape have leave depart 
49,"Of course we know from Kipling that that means, ‘You’d better bunk, and be sharp about it,’ so we came away. I do like Albert’s uncle.",course know mean good bunk sharp come like uncle 
50,"I shall be like that when I’m a man. He gave us our Jungle books, and he is awfully clever, though he does have to write grown-up tales.",man give book clever have write grow tale 
51,"We told Father about it that night. He was very kind. He said we might certainly have the half-sovereign, and he hoped we should enjoy ourselves with our treasure-trove.",tell night kind say have half sovereign hope enjoy treasure trove 
52,"Then he said, ‘Your dear Mother’s Indian Uncle is coming to dinner here to-morrow night. So will you not drag the furniture about overhead, please, more than you’re absolutely obliged; and H. O. might wear slippers or something. I can always distinguish the note of H. O.’s boots.’",say dear mother indian come dinner night drag furniture overhead more oblige wear slipper distinguish note boot 
53,"We said we would be very quiet, and Father went on--",say quiet father go 
54,"‘This Indian Uncle is not used to children, and he is coming to talk business with me. It is really important that he should be quiet. Do you think, Dora, that perhaps bed at six for H. O. and Noel--’",indian uncle use child come talk business important quiet think bed 
55,"But H. O. said, ‘Father, I really and truly won’t make a noise. I’ll stand on my head all the evening sooner than disturb the Indian Uncle with my boots.’",say father make noise stand head evening disturb indian uncle boot 
56,"And Alice said Noel never made a row anyhow. So Father laughed and said, ‘All right.’ And he said we might do as we liked with the half-sovereign. ‘Only for goodness’ sake don’t try to go in for business with it,’ he said. ‘It’s always a mistake to go into business with an insufficient capital.’",say make row laugh say right say do like half sovereign goodness sake try go business say mistake go business insufficient capital 
57,"We talked it over all that evening, and we decided that as we were not to go into business with our half-sovereign it was no use not spending it at once, and so we might as well have a right royal feast. The next day we went out and bought the things. We got figs, and almonds and raisins, and a real raw rabbit, and Eliza promised to cook it for us if we would wait till tomorrow, because of the Indian Uncle coming to dinner. She was very busy cooking nice things for him to eat. We got the rabbit because we are so tired of beef and mutton, and Father hasn’t a bill at the poultry shop. And we got some flowers to go on the dinner-table for Father’s party. And we got hardbake and raspberry noyau and peppermint rock and oranges and a coconut, with other nice things. We put it all in the top long drawer. It is H. O.’s play drawer, and we made him turn his things out and put them in Father’s old portmanteau. H. O. is getting old enough now to learn to be unselfish, and besides, his drawer wanted tidying very badly. Then we all vowed by the honour of the ancient House of Bastable that we would not touch any of the feast till Dora gave the word next day. And we gave H. O. some of the hardbake, to make it easier for him to keep his vow. The next day was the most rememorable day in all our lives, but we didn’t know that then. But that is another story. I think that is such a useful way to know when you can’t think how to end up a chapter. I learnt it from another writer named Kipling. I’ve mentioned him before, I believe, but he deserves it!",talk evening decide go business half sovereign use spend have right royal feast next day go buy thing get fig almond raisin real raw rabbit promise cook wait tomorrow indian uncle come dinner busy cook nice thing eat get rabbit tired beef mutton father bill poultry shop get flower go dinner table party get hardbake raspberry noyau peppermint rock orange coconut other nice thing put top long drawer play drawer make turn thing put old portmanteau get old learn unselfish drawer want tidy vow honour ancient touch feast give word next day give hardbake make easy keep vow next day rememorable day life know story think useful way know think end chapter learn writer name mention believe deserve
