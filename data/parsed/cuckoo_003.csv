She felt as happy and light-hearted as possible, and she wished it was morning, that she might get up.

78,"So Griselda was hurried off to her lessons, and Dorcas to her kitchen. But Griselda did not much mind.

82,"I suppose it was with working so hard at her lessons--most people would say it was with having been up the night before, running about the house in the moonlight; but as she had never felt so ""fresh"" in her life as when she got up that morning, it could hardly have been that--that Griselda felt so tired and sleepy that evening, she could hardly keep her eyes open. She begged to go to bed quite half an hour earlier than usual, which made Miss Tabitha afraid again that she was going to be ill. But as there is nothing better for children than to go to bed early, even if they _are_ going to be ill, Miss Grizzel told her to say good-night, and to ask Dorcas to give her a wine-glassful of elderberry wine, nice and hot, after she was in bed.",suppose work lesson most person say night run house moonlight feel fresh life get morning feel tired sleepy evening keep eye open begg go bed hour usual make afraid go ill be good child go bed go ill tell say good night ask give wine glassful elderberry wine nice hot bed

She certainly did not need it to send her to sleep, for almost before her head touched the pillow she was as sound as a top. She had slept a good long while, when again she wakened suddenly--just as she had done the night before, and again with the feeling that something had wakened her. And the queer thing was that the moment she was awake she felt so _very_ awake--she had no inclination to stretch and yawn and hope it wasn't quite time to get up, and think how nice and warm bed was, and how cold it was outside!

Griselda could hear it on the window-panes, through the closed shutters and all. But dark as it was, she made her way along without any difficulty, down the passage, across the great saloon, in through the ante-room door, guided only by the little voice now and then to be heard in front of her.
