2," Ventimore made his way to Cottesmore Gardens that evening in a highly inconsistent, not to say chaotic, state of mind. The thought that he would presently see Sylvia again made his blood course quicker, while he was fully determined to say no more to her than civility demanded.",make way evening inconsistent say chaotic state mind thought see make blood course quick determined say more civility demand 
3,"At one moment he was blessing Professor Futvoye for his happy thought in making use of him; at another he was bitterly recognising that it would have been better for his peace of mind if he had been left alone. Sylvia and her mother had no desire to see more of him; if they had, they would have asked him to come before this. No doubt they would tolerate him now for the Professor's sake; but who would not rather be ignored than tolerated?",moment bless happy thought make use recognise good peace mind leave alone mother have desire see more have ask come doubt tolerate sake ignore tolerate 
4,The more often he saw Sylvia the more she would make his heart ache with vain longing--whereas he was getting almost reconciled to her indifference; he would very soon be cured if he didn't see her.,see more make heart ache vain longing reconcile indifference cure see 
5,"Why _should_ he see her? He need not go in at all. He had merely to leave the catalogue with his compliments, and the Professor would learn all he wanted to know.",see go have leave catalogue compliment learn want know 
6,"On second thoughts he must go in--if only to return the bank-note. But he would ask to see the Professor in private. Most probably he would not be invited to join his wife and daughter, but if he were, he could make some excuse. They might think it a little odd--a little discourteous, perhaps; but they would be too relieved to care much about that.",second thought go return bank note ask see private invite join wife daughter make excuse think little odd little discourteous relieved care much 
7,"When he got to Cottesmore Gardens, and was actually at the door of the Futvoyes' house, one of the neatest and demurest in that retired and irreproachable quarter, he began to feel a craven hope that the Professor might be out, in which case he need only leave the catalogue and write a letter when he got home, reporting his non-success at the sale, and returning the note.",get door house neatest demurest retire irreproachable quarter begin feel craven hope case leave catalogue write letter get report non-success sale return note 
8,"And, as it happened, the Professor _was_ out, and Horace was not so glad as he thought he should be. The maid told him that the ladies were in the drawing-room, and seemed to take it for granted that he was coming in, so he had himself announced. He would not stay long--just long enough to explain his business there, and make it clear that he had no wish to force his acquaintance upon them. He found Mrs. Futvoye in the farther part of the pretty double drawing-room, writing letters, and Sylvia, more dazzlingly fair than ever in some sort of gauzy black frock with a heliotrope sash and a bunch of Parma violets on her breast, was comfortably established with a book in the front room, and seemed surprised, if not resentful, at having to disturb herself.",happen glad think maid tell lady draw room seem take grant come announce stay explain business make clear have wish force acquaintance find far part pretty double draw room writing letter fair sort gauzy black frock heliotrope sash bunch violet breast establish book front room seem surprise resentful have disturb

10,"""I know all about it,"" interrupted Mrs. Futvoye, brusquely, while her shrewd, light-grey eyes took him in with a cool stare that was humorously observant without being aggressive.

12,"""Ah, well, it's very nice of you to make light of it; but he ought not to have done it--after so short an acquaintance, too.

But, please sit down, Mr. Ventimore.""",sure glad say study cramm odd end want whole house look museum antiquity shop trouble world persuade great gaudy gilded mummy case thing draw room sit

21,"It would have been impossible to refuse to stay after that--even if he had wished. It would only be for a few minutes. Sylvia might spare him that much of her time.

He returned mechanical replies, with a dreary wonder whether this could really be the girl who had talked to him with such charming friendliness and confidence only a few weeks ago in Normandy.",take seat make few constrain remark sheer civility return mechanical reply dreary wonder girl talk such charming friendliness confidence few week 
23,"And the worst of it was, she was looking more bewitching than ever; her slim arms gleaming through the black lace of her sleeves, and the gold threads in her soft masses of chestnut hair sparkling in the light of the shaded lamp behind her. The slight contraction of her eyebrows and the mutinous downward curve of her mouth seemed expressive of boredom.",bad look bewitching slim arm gleam black lace sleeve gold thread soft mass chestnut hair sparkling light shade lamp slight contraction eyebrow mutinous downward curve mouth seem expressive boredom

Oh, I saw it in your face directly--you became conventional and distant and horrid, and it made me horrid too; and you went away determined that you wouldn't see any more of us than you could help.

I thought _you_ were changed, that you wished to forget, and wished me to forget--only I can't--that we had been friends for a short time.

""Mother darling,"" she said, in a half whisper, ""it's really all your fault for writing such very long letters, but--but--we don't exactly know how we came to do it--but Horace and I have got engaged somehow.

58,"""I'm afraid I've been to blame,"" said Mrs. Futvoye. ""I ought to have foreseen this at St. Luc. Sylvia is our only child, Mr. Ventimore, and I would far rather see her happily married than making what is called a 'grand match.' Still, this really does seem _rather_ hopeless.

61,"She was so clearly within her rights, and so much more indulgent than Horace had expected--for he had always considered her an unsentimental and rather worldly woman--that he accepted her conditions almost gratefully.

68,"""So am I, sir,"" said Horace, and proceeded to give his account of the sale, which did not serve to improve the Professor's temper. He thrust out his under lip at certain items in the catalogue. ""I wish I'd gone myself,"" he said; ""that bowl, a really fine example of sixteenth-century Persian work, going for only five guineas! I'd willingly have given ten for it.

No, I do _not_ contemplate that as a probable contingency. But it is not quite impossible that a vessel closed as Mr. Ventimore describes may have been designed as a receptacle for papyri or other records of archæological interest, which may be still in preservation. I should recommend you, sir, to use the greatest precaution in removing the lid--don't expose the documents, if any, too suddenly to the outer air, and it would be better if you did not handle them yourself.

Then he gripped the vessel between his knees and put forth all his strength, while the bottle seemed to rock and heave under him in sympathy.

But this must have been an optical illusion caused by the magnifying effects of the smoke; for, as it cleared, his visitor proved to be of no more than ordinary stature. He was elderly, and, indeed, venerable of appearance, and wore an Eastern robe and head-dress of a dark-green hue.
