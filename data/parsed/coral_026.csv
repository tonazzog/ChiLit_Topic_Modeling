3,"Next day the wood-cutting party went ashore again, and I accompanied them as before.  During the dinner hour I wandered into the woods alone, being disinclined for food that day.  I had not rambled far when I found myself unexpectedly on the sea-shore, having crossed a narrow neck of land which separated the native village from a large bay.  Here I found a party of the islanders busy with one of their war-canoes, which was almost ready for launching.  I stood for a long time watching this party with great interest, and observed that they fastened the timbers and planks to each other very much in the same way in which I had seen Jack fasten those of our little boat.  But what surprised me most was its immense length, which I measured very carefully, and found to be a hundred feet long; and it was so capacious that it could have held three hundred men.  It had the unwieldy out-rigger and enormously high stern-posts which I had remarked on the canoe that came to us while I was on the Coral Island. Observing some boys playing at games a short way along the beach, I resolved to go and watch them; but as I turned from the natives who were engaged so busily and cheerfully at their work, I little thought of the terrible event that hung on the completion of that war-canoe.",next day wood cutting party go accompany dinner hour wander wood disincline food day ramble find sea shore cross narrow neck land separate native village large bay find party islander busy war canoe ready launch stand long time watch party great interest observe fasten timber plank other same way see fast little boat surprise most immense length measure find foot long capacious hold man have unwieldy out rigger high stern post remark canoe come coral observe boy play game short way beach resolve go watch turn native engage work think terrible event hang completion war canoe 
4,"Advancing towards the children, who were so numerous that I began to think this must be the general play-ground of the village, I sat down on a grassy bank under the shade of a plantain-tree, to watch them.  And a happier or more noisy crew I have never seen.  There were at least two hundred of them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other garments than their own glossy little black skins, except the maro, or strip of cloth round the loins of the boys, and a very short petticoat or kilt on the girls.  They did not all play at the same game, but amused themselves in different groups.",advance child numerous begin think general play ground village sit grassy bank shade plantain tree watch happy noisy crew see be least boy girl clad other garment own glossy little black skin maro strip cloth loin boy short petticoat kilt girl play same game amuse different group 
5,"One band was busily engaged in a game exactly similar to our blind-man's- buff.  Another set were walking on stilts, which raised the children three feet from the ground.  They were very expert at this amusement and seldom tumbled.  In another place I observed a group of girls standing together, and apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I went up to see what they were doing, and found that they were opening their eye-lids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an enormous size, and then thrusting pieces of straw between the upper and lower lids, across the eye-ball, to keep them in that position!  This seemed to me, I must confess, a very foolish as well as dangerous amusement.  Nevertheless the children seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they made. I pondered this subject a good deal, and thought that if little children knew how silly they seem to grown-up people when they make faces, they would not be so fond of doing it.  In another place were a number of boys engaged in flying kites, and I could not help wondering that some of the games of those little savages should be so like to our own, although they had never seen us at play.  But the kites were different from ours in many respects, being of every variety of shape.  They were made of very thin cloth, and the boys raised them to a wonderful height in the air by means of twine made from the cocoa-nut husk.  Other games there were, some of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor savages, and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be sent out to them.  But the amusement which the greatest number of the children of both sexes seemed to take chief delight in, was swimming and diving in the sea; and the expertness which they exhibited was truly amazing.  They seemed to have two principal games in the water, one of which was to dive off a sort of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea, and chase each other in the water.  Some of them went down to an extraordinary depth; others skimmed along the surface, or rolled over and over like porpoises, or diving under each other, came up unexpectedly and pulled each other down by a leg or an arm.  They never seemed to tire of this sport, and, from the great heat of the water in the South Seas, they could remain in it nearly all day without feeling chilled.  Many of these children were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they staggered down the beach, flung their round fat little black bodies fearlessly into deep water, and struck out to sea with as much confidence as ducklings.",band engage game similar blind man buff set walk stilt raise child foot ground expert amusement tumble place observe group girl stand enjoy go see do find open eye lid finger eye appear enormous size thrust piece straw upper low lid eye ball keep position seem confess foolish dangerous amusement child seem delighted hideous face make ponder subject good deal think little child know silly seem grow person make face fond do place number boy engage fly kite help wonder game little savage own see play kite different many respect variety shape make thin cloth boy raise wonderful height air means twine make cocoa nut husk other game show natural depravity heart poor savage make wish missionary send amusement great number child sexe seem take chief delight swim diving sea expertness exhibit amazing seem have principal game water dive sort stage erect deep part sea chase other water go extraordinary depth other skimm surface roll porpoise diving other come pull other leg arm seem tire sport great heat water remain day feel chill many child infant scarce able walk stagger beach flung round fat little black body deep water strike sea much confidence duckling 
6,"The other game to which I have referred was swimming in the surf.  But as this is an amusement in which all engage, from children of ten to gray- headed men of sixty, and as I had an opportunity of witnessing it in perfection the day following, I shall describe it more minutely.",other game refer swim surf amusement engage child gray head man have opportunity witness perfection day follow describe

8,"""What sort of amusement is this surf swimming?"" I inquired of Bill, as we walked together to a part of the shore on which several thousands of the natives were assembled.",sort amusement surf swim inquire walk part shore several thousand native assemble 
9,"""It's a very favourite lark with these 'xtr'or'nary critters,"" replied Bill, giving a turn to the quid of tobacco that invariably bulged out his left cheek.  ""Ye see, Ralph, them fellows take to the water as soon a'most as they can walk, an' long before they can do that anything respectably, so that they are as much at home in the sea as on the land. Well, ye see, I 'spose they found swimmin' for miles out to sea, and divin' fathoms deep, wasn't exciting enough, so they invented this game o' the surf.  Each man and boy, as you see, has got a short board or plank, with which he swims out for a mile or more to sea, and then, gettin' on the top o' yon thundering breaker, they come to shore on the top of it, yellin' and screechin' like fiends.  It's a marvel to me that they're not dashed to shivers on the coral reef, for sure an' sartin am I that if any o' us tried it, we wouldn't be worth the fluke of a broken anchor after the wave fell.  But there they go!""",favourite lark critter reply give turn quid tobacco bulg left cheek see fellow take water walk do much home sea land see spose find swimmin mile sea divin fathom deep exciting invent game surf man boy see get short board plank swim mile more sea gettin top yon thunder breaker come shore top yellin screechin' fiend marvel dash shiver coral reef sure sartin try worth fluke break anchor wave fall go 
10,"As he spoke, several hundreds of the natives, amongst whom we were now standing, uttered a loud yell, rushed down the beach, plunged into the surf, and were carried off by the seething foam of the retreating wave.",speak several hundred native stand utter loud yell rush beach plunge surf carry seethe foam retreat wave 
11,"At the point where we stood, the encircling coral reef joined the shore, so that the magnificent breakers, which a recent stiff breeze had rendered larger than usual, fell in thunder at the feet of the multitudes who lined the beach.  For some time the swimmers continued to strike out to sea, breasting over the swell like hundreds of black seals.  Then they all turned, and, watching an approaching billow, mounted its white crest, and, each laying his breast on the short flat board, came rolling towards the shore, careering on the summit of the mighty wave, while they and the onlookers shouted and yelled with excitement.  Just as the monster wave curled in solemn majesty to fling its bulky length upon the beach, most of the swimmers slid back into the trough behind; others, slipping off their boards, seized them in their hands, and, plunging through the watery waste, swam out to repeat the amusement; but a few, who seemed to me the most reckless, continued their career until they were launched upon the beach, and enveloped in the churning foam and spray.  One of these last came in on the crest of the wave most manfully, and landed with a violent bound almost on the spot where Bill and I stood.  I saw by his peculiar head-dress that he was the chief whom the tribe entertained as their guest.  The sea-water had removed nearly all the paint with which his face had been covered; and, as he rose panting to his feet, I recognised, to my surprise, the features of Tararo, my old friend of the Coral Island!",point stand encircle coral reef join shore magnificent breaker recent stiff breeze render large usual fall thunder foot multitude line beach time swimmer continue strike sea breast swell hundred black seal turn watch approach billow mount white crest lay breast short flat board come roll shore career summit mighty wave onlooker shout yell excitement monster wave curl solemn majesty fling bulky length beach most swimmer slide trough other slip board seize hand plung watery waste swim repeat amusement few seem reckless continue career launch beach envelop churning foam spray last come crest wave land violent bind spot stand see peculiar head dress chief tribe entertain guest sea water remove paint face cover rise pant foot recognise surprise feature old friend 
12,"Tararo at the same moment recognised me, and, advancing quickly, took me round the neck and rubbed noses; which had the effect of transferring a good deal of the moist paint from his nose to mine.  Then, recollecting that this was not the white man's mode of salutation, he grasped me by the hand and shook it violently.",same moment recognise advance take neck rub nose have effect transfer good deal moist paint nose recollect white man mode salutation grasp hand shake

14,"""Right, Bill,"" I replied, ""he is indeed an old acquaintance;"" and I explained in a few words that he was the chief whose party Jack and Peterkin and I had helped to save.",right reply old acquaintance explain few word chief party help save 
15,"Tararo having thrown away his surf-board, entered into an animated conversation with Bill, pointing frequently during the course of it to me; whereby I concluded he must be telling him about the memorable battle, and the part we had taken in it.  When he paused, I begged of Bill to ask him about the woman Avatea, for I had some hope that she might have come with Tararo on this visit.  ""And ask him,"" said I, ""who she is, for I am persuaded she is of a different race from the Feejeeans.""  On the mention of her name the chief frowned darkly, and seemed to speak with much anger.",throw surf board enter animated conversation point course conclude tell memorable battle part take pause begg ask woman have hope come visit ask say persuade different race mention name chief frown seem speak much anger 
16,"""You're right, Ralph,"" said Bill, when the chief had ceased to talk; ""she's not a Feejee girl, but a Samoan.  How she ever came to this place the chief does not very clearly explain, but he says she was taken in war, and that he got her three years ago, an' kept her as his daughter ever since.  Lucky for her, poor girl, else she'd have been roasted and eaten like the rest.""",right say chief cease talk girl come place chief explain say take war get year keep daughter lucky poor girl else roast eat rest 
17,"""But why does Tararo frown and look so angry?"" said I.",frown look angry say 
18,"""Because the girl's somewhat obstinate, like most o' the sex, an' won't marry the man he wants her to.  It seems that a chief of some other island came on a visit to Tararo and took a fancy to her, but she wouldn't have him on no account, bein' already in love, and engaged to a young chief whom Tararo hates, and she kicked up a desperate shindy; so, as he was going on a war expedition in his canoe, he left her to think about it, sayin' he'd be back in six months or so, when he hoped she wouldn't be so obstropolous.  This happened just a week ago; an' Tararo says that if she's not ready to go, when the chief returns, as his bride, she'll be sent to him as a _long pig_.""",girl obstinate most sex marry man want seem chief other island come visit take fancy have account bein love engage young chief hate kick desperate shindy go war expedition canoe leave think month hope obstropolous happen week say ready go chief return bride send _long pig_

20,"""He means somethin' very unpleasant,"" answered Bill with a frown.  ""You see these blackguards eat men an' women just as readily as they eat pigs; and, as baked pigs and baked men are very like each other in appearance, they call men _long_ pigs.  If Avatea goes to this fellow as a long pig, it's all up with her, poor thing.""",mean unpleasant answer frown see blackguard eat man woman eat pig bake pig bake man other appearance call man pig go fellow long pig poor thing

24,"""About fifty or sixty miles to the south'ard o' this,"" returned Bill; ""but I--""",mile south'ard return 
25,"At this moment we were startled by the cry of ""Mao! mao!--a shark! a shark!"" which was immediately followed by a shriek that rang clear and fearfully loud above the tumult of cries that arose from the savages in the water and on the land.  We turned hastily towards the direction whence the cry came, and had just time to observe the glaring eye-balls of one of the swimmers as he tossed his arms in the air.  Next instant he was pulled under the waves.  A canoe was instantly launched, and the hand of the drowning man was caught, but only half of his body was dragged from the maw of the monster, which followed the canoe until the water became so shallow that it could scarcely swim.  The crest of the next billow was tinged with red as it rolled towards the shore.",moment startle cry shark shark follow shriek ring clear loud tumult cry arise savage water land turn direction cry come have time observe glaring eye ball swimmer toss arm air next instant pull wave canoe launch hand drown man catch half body drag maw monster follow canoe water become shallow swim crest next billow ting red roll shore 
26,"In most countries of the world this would have made a deep impression on the spectators, but the only effect it had upon these islanders was to make them hurry with all speed out of the sea, lest a similar fate should befall some of the others; but, so utterly reckless were they of human life, that it did not for a moment suspend the progress of their amusements.  It is true the surf-swimming ended for that time somewhat abruptly, but they immediately proceeded with other games.  Bill told me that sharks do not often attack the surf-swimmers, being frightened away by the immense numbers of men and boys in the water, and by the shouting and splashing that they make.  ""But,"" said he, ""such a thing as you have seen just now don't frighten them much.  They'll be at it again to-morrow or next day, just as if there wasn't a single shark between Feejee and Nova Zembla.""",most country world make deep impression spectator only effect have islander make hurry speed sea similar fate befall other reckless human life moment suspend progress amusement true surf swim end time proceed other game tell shark attack surf swimmer frighten immense number man boy water shouting splashing make say thing see frighten much next day be single shark 
27,"After this the natives had a series of wrestling and boxing matches; and being men of immense size and muscle, they did a good deal of injury to each other, especially in boxing, in which not only the lower orders, but several of the chiefs and priests engaged.  Each bout was very quickly terminated, for they did not pretend to a scientific knowledge of the art, and wasted no time in sparring, but hit straight out at each other's heads, and their blows were delivered with great force.  Frequently one of the combatants was knocked down with a single blow; and one gigantic fellow hit his adversary so severely that he drove the skin entirely off his forehead.  This feat was hailed with immense applause by the spectators.",native have series wrestling boxing match man immense size muscle do good deal injury other boxing low order several chief priest engage bout terminate pretend scientific knowledge art waste time sparr hit other head blow deliver great force combatant knock single blow gigantic fellow hit adversary drive skin forehead feat hail immense applause spectator 
28,"During these exhibitions, which were very painful to me, though I confess I could not refrain from beholding them, I was struck with the beauty of many of the figures and designs that were tattooed on the persons of the chiefs and principal men.  One figure, that seemed to me very elegant, was that of a palm-tree tattooed on the back of a man's leg, the roots rising, as it were, from under his heel, the stem ascending the tendon of the ankle, and the graceful head branching out upon the calf.  I afterwards learned that this process of tattooing is very painful, and takes long to do, commencing at the age of ten, and being continued at intervals up to the age of thirty.  It is done by means of an instrument made of bone, with a number of sharp teeth with which the skin is punctured.  Into these punctures a preparation made from the kernel of the candle-nut, mixed with cocoa-nut oil, is rubbed, and the mark thus made is indelible.  The operation is performed by a class of men whose profession it is, and they tattoo as much at a time, as the person on whom they are operating can bear; which is not much, the pain and inflammation caused by tattooing being very great, sometimes causing death.  Some of the chiefs were tattooed with an ornamental stripe down the legs, which gave them the appearance of being clad in tights.  Others had marks round the ankles and insteps, which looked like tight-fitting and elegant boots.  Their faces were also tattooed, and their breasts were very profusely marked with every imaginable species of device,--muskets, dogs, birds, pigs, clubs, and canoes, intermingled with lozenges, squares, circles, and other arbitrary figures.",exhibition painful confess refrain behold strike beauty many figure design tattooe person chief principal man figure seem elegant palm tree tattooe back man leg root rise heel stem ascend tendon ankle graceful head branch calf learn process tattooing painful take long do commence age continue interval age do means instrument make bone number sharp tooth skin puncture puncture preparation make kernel candle nut mix cocoa nut oil rub mark make indelible operation perform class man profession tattoo much time person operate bear much pain inflammation cause tattooing great cause death chief tattooe ornamental stripe leg give appearance clad tight other have mark ankle instep look tight fitting elegant boot face tattooe breast mark imaginable species device musket dog bird pig club canoe intermingle lozenge square circle other arbitrary figure 
29,"The women were not tattooed so much as the men, having only a few marks on their feet and arms.  But I must say, however objectionable this strange practice may be, it nevertheless had this good effect, that it took away very much from their appearance of nakedness.",woman tattooe much man have few mark foot arm say objectionable strange practice have good effect take appearance nakedness 
30,"Next day, while we were returning from the woods to our schooner, we observed Romata rushing about in the neighbourhood of his house, apparently mad with passion.",next day return wood schooner observe rush neighbourhood house mad passion 
31,"""Ah!"" said Bill to me, ""there he's at his old tricks again.  That's his way when he gets drink.  The natives make a sort of drink o' their own, and it makes him bad enough; but when he gets brandy he's like a wild tiger.  The captain, I suppose, has given him a bottle, as usual, to keep him in good humour.  After drinkin' he usually goes to sleep, and the people know it well and keep out of his way, for fear they should waken him.  Even the babies are taken out of ear-shot; for, when he's waked up, he rushes out just as you see him now, and spears or clubs the first person he meets.""",say old trick way get drink native make sort drink own make bad get brandy wild tiger captain suppose give bottle usual keep good humour drinkin go sleep person know keep way fear wake baby take ear shot wake rush see spear club first person meet 
32,"It seemed at the present time, however, that no deadly weapon had been in his way, for the infuriated chief was raging about without one.  Suddenly he caught sight of an unfortunate man who was trying to conceal himself behind a tree.  Rushing towards him, Romata struck him a terrible blow on the head, which knocked out the poor man's eye and also dislocated the chief's finger.  The wretched creature offered no resistance; he did not even attempt to parry the blow.  Indeed, from what Bill said, I found that he might consider himself lucky in having escaped with his life, which would certainly have been forfeited had the chief been possessed of a club at the time.",seem present time deadly weapon way infuriate chief rage catch sight unfortunate man try conceal tree rush strike terrible blow head knock poor man eye dislocate chief finger wretched creature offer resistance attempt parry blow say find consider lucky escape life forfeit chief possess club time 
33,"""Have these wretched creatures no law among themselves,"" said I, ""which can restrain such wickedness?""",have wretch creature law say restrain such wickedness 
34,"""None,"" replied Bill.  ""The chief's word is law.  He might kill and eat a dozen of his own subjects any day for nothing more than his own pleasure, and nobody would take the least notice of it.""",reply chief word law kill eat own subject day more own pleasure take least notice 
35,"This ferocious deed took place within sight of our party as we wended our way to the beach, but I could not observe any other expression on the faces of the men than that of total indifference or contempt.  It seemed to me a very awful thing that it should be possible for men to come to such hardness of heart and callousness to the sight of bloodshed and violence; but, indeed, I began to find that such constant exposure to scenes of blood was having a slight effect upon myself, and I shuddered when I came to think that I, too, was becoming callous.",ferocious deed take place sight party wend way beach observe other expression face man total indifference contempt seem awful thing possible man come such hardness heart callousness sight bloodshed violence begin find such constant exposure scene blood have slight effect shudder come think become callous 
36,"I thought upon this subject much that night while I walked up and down the deck during my hours of watch; and I came to the conclusion that if I, who hated, abhorred, and detested such bloody deeds as I had witnessed within the last few weeks, could so soon come to be less sensitive about them, how little wonder that these poor ignorant savages, who were born and bred in familiarity therewith, should think nothing of them at all, and should hold human life in so very slight esteem.",think subject night walk deck hour watch come conclusion hate abhorr detest such bloody deed witness last few week come sensitive little wonder poor ignorant savage bear breed familiarity think hold human life slight esteem
