4,"“We must be before the sun!” said Ebbo, who was on his feet, beginning to dress himself.  “Hush, and come!  Do not wake the mother.  It must be ere she or aught else be astir!  Thy prayers—I tell thee this is a work as good as prayer.”",sun say foot begin dress come wake mother aught else astir prayer tell work good prayer 
5,"Half awake, and entirely bewildered, Friedel dipped his finger in the pearl mussel shell of holy water over their bed, and crossed his own brow and his brother’s; then, carrying their shoes, they crossed their mother’s chamber, and crept down stairs.  Ebbo muttered to his brother, “Stand thou still there, and pray the saints to keep her asleep;” and then, with bare feet, moved noiselessly behind the wooden partition that shut off his grandmother’s box-bedstead from the rest of the hall.  She lay asleep with open mouth, snoring loudly, and on her pillow lay the bunch of castle keys, that was always carried to her at night.  It was a moment of peril when Ebbo touched it; but he had nerved himself to be both steady and dexterous, and he secured it without a jingle, and then, without entering the hall, descended into a passage lit by a rough opening cut in the rock.  Friedel, who began to comprehend, followed him close and joyfully, and at the first door he fitted in, and with some difficulty turned, a key, and pushed open the door of a vault, where morning light, streaming through the grated window, showed two captives, who had started to their feet, and now stood regarding the pair in the doorway as if they thought their dreams were multiplying the young Baron who had led the attack.",half awake bewilder dip finger pearl mussel shell holy water bed cross own brow brother carry shoe cross mother chamber creep stair mutter brother stand pray saint keep asleep bare foot move wooden partition shut grandmother box bedstead rest hall lay open mouth snore pillow lay bunch castle key carry night moment peril touch nerve steady dexterous secure jingle enter hall descend passage light rough opening cut rock begin comprehend follow first door fit difficulty turn key push open door vault morning light stream grate window show captive start foot stand regard pair doorway think dream multiply young lead attack

8,"The merchant’s knowledge of German was small, but the purport of the words was plain, and he gladly left the damp, chilly vault.  Ebbo pointed to the bales that strewed the hall.  “Take all that can be carried,” he said.  “Here is your sword, and your purse,” he said, for these had been given to him in the moment of victory.  “I will bring out your horse and lead you to the pass.”",merchant knowledge small purport word plain leave damp chilly vault point bale strew hall take carry say sword purse say give moment victory bring horse lead pass

Only he faltered in broken German a proposal to pay his respects to the Signora Castellana, to whom he owed so much.",give food whisper merchant anxious have appetite falter break proposal pay respect owe much

11,"The Latin proved most serviceable, and the merchant understood that his property was restored, and made all speed to gather it together, and transport it to the stable.  One or two of his beasts of burden had been lost in the fray, and there were more packages than could well be carried by the merchant, his servant, and his horse.  Ebbo gave the aid of the old white mare—now very white indeed—and in truth the boys pitied the merchant’s fine young bay for being put to base trading uses, and were rather shocked to hear that it had been taken in payment for a knight’s branched velvet gown, and would be sold again at Ulm.",prove serviceable merchant understand property restore make speed gather transport stable beast burden lose fray be more package carry merchant servant horse give aid old white mare white truth boy pity merchant fine young bay put base trading use shocked hear take payment knight branch velvet gown sell 
12,"“What a poor coxcomb of a knight!” said they to one another, as they patted the creature’s neck with such fervent admiration that the merchant longed to present it to them, when he saw that the old white mare was the sole steed they possessed, and watched their tender guidance both of her and of the bay up the rocky path so familiar to them.",poor coxcomb knight say patt creature neck such fervent admiration merchant long present see old white mare sole steed possess watch tender guidance bay rocky path familiar

A goodly man and a tall, piteously cramped in the narrow deck, I grieved to leave him there when the good _confraternità_ at Genoa paid my ransom.  Having learnt to speak _il Tedesco_, and being no longer able to fit out a vessel, I made my venture beyond the Alps; but, alas! till this moment fortune has still been adverse.  My mules died of the toil of crossing the mountains; and, when with reduced baggage I came to the river beneath there—when my horses fell and my servants fled, and the peasants came down with their hayforks—I thought myself in hands no better than those of the Moors themselves.”",_signorini miei_ fellow captive _cavaliere_ own land betray sell enemy mourn bride say goodly man tall cramped narrow deck grieve leave good _confraternità_ pay ransom learn speak able fit vessel make venture moment fortune adverse mule die toil cross mountain reduce baggage come river horse fall servant flead peasant come hayfork think hand good

33,"“Strange,” muttered the merchant, as he watched the two boys turn down the pass, “strange how like one barbarous name is to another.  Eberardo! That was what we called _il Tedesco_, and, when he once told me his family name, it ended in _stino_; but all these foreign names sound alike.

I can tell you we made them run!  But I never meant the grandmother to put yon poor fellow in the dungeon, and use him worse than a dog.  I wot that he was my captive, and none of hers.  And then came the mother; and oh, Friedel, she looked as if I were slaying her when she saw the spoil; and, ere I had made her see right and reason, the old lady came swooping down in full malice and spite, and actually came to blows.

My father’s wife is as good a lady of the castle as my grandfather’s, and I myself am lord thereof; and, since my Lady Kunigunde chooses to cross me and beat my mother about this capture, why she has seen the last of it, and may learn who is master, and who is mistress!”",say stand take old hag hand tell rule father wife good lady castle grandfather lord choose cross beat mother capture see last learn master mistress

48,"“Never, Friedel!  I will never see her so used again.  I released this man solely to show that she is to rule here.—Yes, I know all about freebooting being a deadly sin, and moreover that it will bring the League about our ears; and it was a cowardly trick of Jobst to put those branches in the stream.  Did I not go over it last night till my brain was dizzy?  But still, it is but living and dying like our fathers, and I hate tameness or dullness, and it is like a fool to go back from what one has once begun.”",see use release man show rule know freeboot deadly sin bring ear cowardly trick put branch stream go last night brain dizzy live die father hate tameness dullness fool go begin

When the grandmother has been raving” (hitherto Friedel’s worst grievance) “it is like getting up nearer the quiet sky in the stillness there, when the sky seems to have come down into the deep blue water, and all is so still, so wondrous still and calm.

My purpose is to be a good man and true, a guard to the weak, a defence against the Turk, a good lord to my vassals, and, if it may not be otherwise, I will take my oath to the Kaiser, and keep it.

Ebbo, much distressed, tried to make her understand that she was to have all care and honour; but she muttered something about ingratitude, and continued to exhaust herself with weeping, spurning away all who approached her; and thenceforth she lived in a gloomy, sullen acquiescence in her deposition.",last day work make great step life stand grave firm ready assault effect expect old lady fly mother wild cat do like case year take surprise collapse chair sobb distress try make understand have care honour mutter ingratitude continue exhaust weeping spurn approach thenceforth live gloomy sullen acquiescence deposition 
83,"Christina inclined to the opinion that she must have had some slight stroke in the night, for she was never the same woman again; her vigour had passed away, and she would sit spinning, or rocking herself in her chair, scarcely alive to what passed, or scolding and fretting like a shadow of her old violence.  Nothing pleased her but the attentions of her grandsons, and happily she soon ceased to know them apart, and gave Ebbo credit for all that was done for her by Friedel, whose separate existence she seemed to have forgotten.",inclined opinion have slight stroke night same woman vigour pass sit spinn rock chair alive pass scold fret shadow old violence pleased attention grandson cease know give credit do separate existence seem forget

85,"Only Elsie remained of the rude, demoralized girls whom she had found in the castle, and their successors, though dull and uncouth, were meek and manageable; the men of the castle had all, except Mätz, been always devoted to the Frau Christina; and Mätz, to her great relief, ran away so soon as he found that decency and honesty were to be the rule.  Old Hatto, humpbacked Hans, and Heinz the Schneiderlein, were the whole male establishment, and had at least the merit of attachment to herself and her sons; and in time there was a shade of greater civilization about the castle, though impeded both by dire poverty and the doggedness of the old retainers.  At least the court was cleared of the swine, and, within doors, the table was spread with dainty linen out of the parcels from Ulm, and the meals served with orderliness that annoyed the boys at first, but soon became a subject of pride and pleasure.",remain rude demoralize girl find castle successor dull uncouth meek manageable man castle devote great relief run find decency honesty rule old humpback whole male establishment have least merit attachment son time be shade great civilization castle imped dire poverty doggedness old retainer least court clear swine door table spread dainty linen parcel meal serve orderliness annoy boy first become subject pride pleasure 
86,"Frau Kunigunde lingered long, with increasing infirmities.  After the winter day, when, running down at a sudden noise, Friedel picked her up from the hearthstone, scorched, bruised, almost senseless, she accepted Christina’s care with nothing worse than a snarl, and gradually seemed to forget the identity of her nurse with the interloping burgher girl. Thanks or courtesy had been no part of her nature, least of all towards her own sex, and she did little but grumble, fret, and revile her attendant; but she soon depended so much on Christina’s care, that it was hardly possible to leave her.  At her best and strongest, her talk was maundering abuse of her son’s low-born wife; but at times her wanderings showed black gulfs of iniquity and coarseness of soul that would make the gentle listener tremble, and be thankful that her sons were out of hearing.  And thus did Christina von Adlerstein requite fifteen years of persecution.",linger increase infirmity winter day run sudden noise pick hearthstone scorch bruise senseless accept care bad snarl seem forget identity nurse interlop burgher girl thanks courtesy part nature least own sex do little grumble fret revile attendant depend care possible leave good strong talk maunder abuse son low bear wife time wandering show black gulf iniquity coarseness soul make gentle listener tremble thankful son hearing requite year persecution 
87,"The old lady’s first failure had been in the summer of 1488; it was the Advent season of 1489, when the snow was at the deepest, and the frost at the hardest, that the two hardy mountaineer grandsons fetched over the pass Father Norbert, and a still sturdier, stronger monk, to the dying woman.",old lady first failure summer season snow deep frost hard hardy mountaineer grandson fetched pass sturdy strong monk die woman 
88,"“Are we in time, mother?” asked Ebbo, from the door of the upper chamber, where the Adlersteins began and ended life, shaking the snow from his mufflings.

93,"Stony insensibility ensued; nor did she speak again, though life lasted many hours longer.  The priests did their office; for, impenitent as the life and frantic as the words had been, the opinions of the time deemed that their rites might yet give the departing soul a chance, though the body was unconscious.",stony insensibility ensue speak life last many hour priest do office impenitent life frantic word opinion time deem rite give depart soul chance body unconscious 
94,"When all was over, snow was again falling, shifting and drifting, so that it was impossible to leave the castle, and the two monks were kept there for a full fortnight, during which Christmas solemnities were observed in the chapel, for the first time since the days of Friedmund the Good.  The corpse of Kunigunde, preserved—we must say the word—salted, was placed in a coffin, and laid in that chapel to await the melting of the snows, when the vault at the Hermitage could be opened.  And this could not be effected till Easter had nearly come round again, and it was within a week of their sixteenth birthday that the two young Barons stood together at the coffin’s head, serious indeed, but more with the thought of life than of death.",snow fall shift drift impossible leave castle monk keep full fortnight solemnity observe chapel first time day corpse preserve say word salt place coffin lay chapel await melting snow vault open effect come week sixteenth birthday young stand coffin head serious more thought life death
