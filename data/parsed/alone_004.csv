1,CHAPTER IV. OLD OLIVER'S MASTER.,old master 
2," Very early in the morning, before the tardy daylight could creep into the darkened room, old Oliver was up and busy. He had been in the habit of doing for himself, as he called it, ever since his daughter had forsaken him, and he was by nature fastidiously clean and neat. But now there would be additional duties for him during the next three days; for there would be Dolly to wash, and dress, and provide breakfast for. Every few minutes he stole a look at her lying still asleep; and as soon as he discovered symptoms of awaking, he hastily lifted Beppo on to the bed, that her opening eyes should be greeted by some familiar sight. She stretched out her wonderful little hands, and caught hold of the dog's rough head before venturing to lift her eyelids, while Oliver looked on in speechless delight. At length she ventured to peep slyly at him, and then addressed herself to Beppo.",morning tardy daylight creep darken room old busy habit do call daughter forsaken nature clean neat be additional duty next day be wash dress provide breakfast few minute steal look lying asleep discover symptom awaking lift bed open eye greet familiar sight stretch wonderful little hand catch hold dog rough head venture lift eyelid look speechless delight length venture peep address

8,"She flung her arms suddenly about his neck and kissed him, while old Oliver trembled with intense joy. It was quite a marvel to him how she helped him to dress her, laughing merrily at the strange mistakes he made in putting on her clothes the wrong side before; and when he assured her that her mother would come back very soon, she seemed satisfied to put up with any passing inconvenience. The shop, with its duties, and the necessity of getting in his daily stock of newspapers, entirely slipped his memory; and he was only recalled to it by a very loud rapping at the door as he was pouring out Dolly's breakfast. To his great surprise he discovered that he had forgotten to take down his shutters, though it was past the hour when his best customers passed by.",flung arm neck kiss old tremble intense joy marvel help dress laugh strange mistake make put clothes wrong side assure mother come seem satisfied put passing inconvenience shop duty necessity get daily stock newspaper slip memory recall loud rapping door pour breakfast great surprise discover forget take shutter hour good customer pass 
9,"The person knocking proved to be none other than Tony, who greeted the old man's appearance with a prolonged whistle, and a grave and reproachful stare.",person knock prove other greet old man appearance prolonged whistle grave reproachful stare 
10,"""Come,"" he said, in a tone of remonstrance, ""this'll never do, you know. Business is business, and must be minded. You pretty nearly frightened me into fits; anybody could have knocked me down with a straw when I see the shutters up. How is she?""",come say tone remonstrance do know business business minded frighten fit knock straw see shutter

12,"""Mother not turned up, I guess?"" said Tony.",mother turn guess say 
13,"""No; she comes on Friday,"" he replied.",come reply 
14,"Tony winked, and put his tongue into his cheek; but he gave utterance to no remark until after the shutters were in their place. Then he surveyed himself as well as he could, with an air of satisfaction. His face and hands were clean, and his skin looked very white through the holes in his tattered clothes; even his feet, except for an unavoidable under surface of dust, were unsoiled. His jacket and trousers appeared somewhat more torn than the evening before; but they bore every mark of having been washed also.",wink put tongue cheek give utterance remark shutter place survey air satisfaction face hand clean skin look white hole tatter clothes foot unavoidable surface dust unsoiled jacket trousers appear torn evening bear mark wash 
15,"""Washed myself early in the morning, afore the bobbies were much about,"" remarked Tony, ""in the fountains at Charing Cross; but I hadn't time to get my rags done, so I did 'em down under the bridge, when the tide were going down; but I could only give 'em a bit of a swill and a ring out. Anyhow, I'm a bit cleaner this morning than last night, master.""",wash morning bobbie remark fountain have time get rag do bridge tide go give bit swill ring bit clean morning last night master

18,"""Not to-day's paper, I'm afraid,"" he said.",day paper afraid say 
19,"""I'm afraid not,"" continued Tony; ""overslept yourself, eh? Not as I can read myself; but there are folks going by as can, and might p'raps buy one here as well as anywhere else. Shall I run and get 'em for you, now I'm on my legs?""",afraid continue oversleep read be folk go p'rap buy else run get leg 
20,"Oliver looked questioningly at the boy, who returned a frank, honest gaze, and said, ""Honour bright!"" as he held out his hand for the money. There was some doubt in the old man's mind after Tony had disappeared as to whether he had not done a very foolish thing; but he soon forgot it when he returned to the breakfast-table; and long before he himself could have reached the place and returned, Tony was back again with his right number of papers.",look boy return frank honest gaze say honour bright hold hand money be doubt old man mind disappear do foolish thing forget return breakfast table reach place return right number paper 
21,"Before many minutes Tony was sitting upon an old box at a little distance from the table, where Oliver sat with his grandchild. A basin of coffee and a large hunch of bread rested upon his knees, and Beppo was sniffing round him with a doubtful air. Dolly was shy in this strange company, and ate her breakfast with a sedate gravity which filled both her companions with astonishment and admiration. When the meal was finished, old Oliver took his daughter's letter from his waistcoat pocket and read it aloud to Tony, who listened with undivided interest.",many minute sit old box little distance table sit grandchild basin coffee large hunch bread rest knee sniff doubtful air shy strange company eat breakfast sedate gravity fill companion astonishment admiration meal finish old take daughter letter waistcoat pocket read listen undivided interest 
22,"""Then she's your own little 'un,"" he said, with a sigh of disappointment. ""You'll never give her up to me, if you get tired of her,--nor to the p'lice neither,"" he added, with a brightening face.",own little un say sigh disappointment give get tired p'lice add brighten face 
23,"""No, no, no!"" answered Oliver, emphatically. ""Besides, her mother's coming on Friday. I wouldn't give her up for all the world, bless her!""",answer mother come give world bless 
24,"""And he's 'listed!"" said Tony, in a tone of envy. ""They wouldn't take me yet a while, if I offered to go. But who's that she speaks of?--'for Christ's sake, if I am worthy to use his name.' Who is he?""",list say tone envy take while offer go speak sake worthy use name 
25,"""Don't you know?"" asked Oliver.",know ask 
26,"""No, never heard tell of him before,"" he answered. ""Is he any friend o' yours?"" [A]",hear tell answer friend

28,"""Ay!"" said Oliver; ""he's my only friend, my best friend. And he's my master, besides.""",say only friend good friend master 
29,"""And she thinks he'd be angry if you turned the little girl away?"" pursued Tony.",think angry turn little girl pursue 
30,"""Yes, yes; he'd be very angry,"" said old Oliver, thoughtfully; ""it 'ud grieve him to his heart. Why, he's always loved little children, and never had them turned away from himself, whatever he was doing. If she hadn't been my own little girl, I daren't have turned her out of my doors. No, no, dear Lord, thee knows as I'd have taken care of her, for thy sake.""",angry say old grieve heart love little child have turn do own little girl turn door dear know take care sake 
31,"He spoke absently, in a low voice, as though talking to some person whom Tony could not see, and the boy was silent a minute or two, thinking busily.",speak low voice talk person see boy silent minute think 
32,"""How long have you worked for that master o' yours?"" he asked, at last.",work master ask last 
33,"""Not very long,"" replied Oliver, regretfully. ""I used to fancy I was working for him years and years ago; but, dear me! it was poor sort o'work; and now I can't do very much. Only he knows how old I am, and he doesn't care so that I love him, which I do, Tony.""",reply use fancy work year year dear poor sort o'work do know old care love do 
34,"""I should think so!"" said the boy, falling again into busy thought, from which he aroused himself by getting up from his box, and rubbing his fingers through his wet and tangled hair.",think say boy fall busy thought arouse get box rub finger wet tangle hair

36,"""Ay, dearly!"" answered old Oliver.",answer old 
37,"""I reckon he'd scarcely take me for a man yet,"" said Tony, at the same time drawing himself up to his full height; ""though I don't know as I should care to work for him. I'd rather have a crossing, and be my own master. But if I get hard up, do you think he'd take to me, if you spoke a word for me?""",reckon take man say same time draw full height know care work have crossing own master get think take speak word

39,"""Not I; how should I?"" answered Tony. ""Why, you don't s'pose as I know all the great folks in London, though I've seen sights and sights of 'em riding about in their carriages. I told you I weren't much bigger nor her there when mother died, and I've picked up my living up and down the streets anyhow, and other lads have helped me on, till I can help 'em on now. It don't cost much to keep a boy on the streets. There's nothink to pay for coals, or rent, or beds, or furniture, or anythink; only your victuals, and a rag now and then. All I want's a broom and a crossing, and then shouldn't I get along just? But I don't know how to get 'em.""",answer s'pose know great folk see sight sight ride carriage tell big mother die pick living street other lad help help cost much keep boy street be nothink pay coal rent bed furniture anythink victual rag want broom crossing get know get

46,"He could take Dolly's hand into his own this morning, and he looked down curiously at it,--a small, rosy, dimpled hand, such as he had never seen before so closely. A lump rose in his throat, and his eyelids smarted with tears again. It was such a little thing, such a pretty little thing, he said to himself, covering it fondly with his other hand. There was no fear that Tony would forget to come back to old Oliver's house.",take hand own morning look small rosy dimple hand such see lump rise throat eyelid smart tear little thing little thing say cover other hand be fear forget come old house
