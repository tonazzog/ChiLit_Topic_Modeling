4," “Norman, do you feel up to a long day’s work?” said Dr. May, on the following morning. “I have to set off after breakfast to see old Mrs. Gould, and to be at Abbotstoke Grange by twelve; then I thought of going to Fordholm, and getting Miss Cleveland to give us some luncheon--there are some poor people on the way to look at; and that girl on Far-view Hill; and there’s another place to call in at coming home. You’ll have a good deal of sitting in the carriage, holding Whitefoot, so if you think you shall be cold or tired, don’t scruple to say so, and I’ll take Adams to drive me.”",feel long day work say follow morning have set breakfast see old think go get give luncheon be poor person way look girl view be place call come home have good deal sit carriage hold think cold tired scruple say take drive

8,"Norman set out with his father, and prosperously performed the expedition, arriving at Abbotstoke Grange at the appointed hour.",set father perform expedition arrive appoint hour 
9,"“Ha!” said the doctor, as the iron gates of ornamental scrollwork were swung back, “there’s a considerable change in this place since I was here last. Well kept up indeed! Not a dead leaf left under the old walnuts, and the grass looks as smooth as if they had a dozen gardeners rolling it every day.”",say doctor iron gate ornamental scrollwork swing be considerable change place last keep dead leaf leave old walnut grass look smooth have gardener roll day 
10,"“And the drive,” said Norman, “more like a garden walk than a road! But oh! what a splendid cedar!”",drive say garden walk road splendid cedar 
11,"“Isn’t it! I remember that as long as I remember anything. All this fine rolling of turf, and trimming up of the place, does not make much difference to you, old fellow, does it? You don’t look altered since I saw you last, when old Jervis was letting the place go to rack and ruin. So they have a new entrance--very handsome conservatory--flowers--the banker does things in style. There,” as Norman helped him off with his plaid, “wrap yourself up well, don’t get cold. The sun is gone in, and I should not wonder if the rain were coming after all. I’ll not be longer than I can help.”",remember remember fine roll turf trimming place make much difference old fellow look alter see last old let place go rack ruin have new entrance handsome conservatory flower banker do thing style help plaid wrap get cold sun gone wonder rain come long help 
12,"Dr. May disappeared from his son’s sight through the conservatory, where, through the plate-glass, the exotics looked so fresh and perfumy, that Norman almost fancied that the scent reached him. “How much poor Margaret would enjoy one of those camellias,” thought he, “and these people have bushels of them for mere show. If I were papa, I should be tempted to be like Beauty’s father, and carry off one. How she would admire it!”",disappear son sight conservatory plate glass exotic look fresh perfumy fancy scent reach much poor enjoy camellias think person have bushel mere show papa tempt father carry admire 
13,"Norman had plenty of time to meditate on the camellias, and then to turn and speculate on the age of the cedar, whether it could have been planted by the monks of Stoneborough Abbey, to whom the Grange had belonged, brought from Lebanon by a pilgrim, perhaps; and then he tried to guess at the longevity of cedars, and thought of asking Margaret, the botanist of the family. Then he yawned, moved the horse a little about, opined that Mr. Rivers must be very prosy, or have some abstruse complaint, considered the sky, and augured rain, buttoned another button of his rough coat, and thought of Miss Cleveland’s dinner. Then he thought there was a very sharp wind, and drove about till he found a sheltered place on the lee side of the great cedar, looked up at it, and thought it would be a fine subject for verses, if Mr. Wilmot knew of it, and then proceeded to consider what he should make of them.",have plenty time meditate camellias turn speculate age cedar plant monk belong bring pilgrim try guess longevity cedar think ask botanist family yawn move horse little opine prosy have abstruse complaint consider sky augure rain button button rough coat think dinner think be sharp wind drive find shelter place side great cedar look think fine subject verse know proceed consider make 
14,"In the midst he was suddenly roused by the deep-toned note of a dog, and beheld a large black Newfoundland dog leaping about the horse in great indignation. “Rollo! Rollo!” called a clear young voice, and he saw two ladles returning from a walk. Rollo, at the first call, galloped back to his mistress, and was evidently receiving an admonition, and promising good behaviour. The two ladies entered the house, while he lay down on the step, with his lion-like paw hanging down, watching Norman with a brilliant pair of hazel eyes. Norman, after a little more wondering when Mr. Rivers would have done with his father, betook himself to civil demonstrations to the creature, who received them with dignity, and presently, after acknowledging with his tail, various whispers of “Good old fellow,” and “Here, old Rollo!” having apparently satisfied himself that the young gentleman was respectable, he rose, and vouchsafed to stand up with his forepaws in the gig, listening amiably to Norman’s delicate flatteries. Norman even began to hope to allure him into jumping on the seat: but a great bell rang, and Rollo immediately turned round, and dashed off, at full speed, to some back region of the house. “So, old fellow, you know what the dinner-bell means,” thought Norman. “I hope Mr. Rivers is hungry too. Miss Cleveland will have eaten up her whole luncheon, if this old bore won’t let my father go soon! I hope he is desperately ill--‘tis his only excuse! Heigh ho! I must jump out to warm my feet soon! There, there’s a drop of rain! Well, there’s no end to it! I wonder what Ethel is doing about Cocksmoor! It is setting in for a wet afternoon!” and Norman disconsolately put up his umbrella.",midst rouse deep tone note dog beheld large black dog leap horse great indignation call clear young voice see ladle return walk first call gallop mistress receive admonition promise good behaviour lady enter house lay step lion paw hang watch brilliant pair hazel eye little wonder do father betak civil demonstration creature receive dignity acknowledge tail various whisper good old fellow old satisfy young gentleman respectable rise vouchsafe stand forepaw gig listen delicate flateery begin hope allure jump seat great bell ring turn dash full speed back region house old fellow know dinner bell mean think hope hungry eat whole luncheon old bore let father go hope ill only excuse jump warm foot be drop rain be end wonder do set wet afternoon put umbrella 
15,"At last Dr. May and another gentleman were seen in the conservatory, and Norman gladly proceeded to clear the seat; but Dr. May called out, “Jump out, Norman, Mr. Rivers is so kind as to ask us to stay to luncheon.”",last gentleman see conservatory proceed clear seat call jump kind ask stay luncheon 
16,"With boyish shrinking from strangers, Norman privately wished Mr. Rivers at Jericho, as he gave the reins to a servant, and entered the conservatory, where a kindly hand was held out to him by a gentleman of about fifty, with a bald smooth forehead, soft blue eyes, and gentle pleasant face. “Is this your eldest son?” said he, turning to Dr. May--and the manner of both was as if they were already well acquainted. “No, this is my second. The eldest is not quite such a long-legged fellow,” said Dr. May. And then followed the question addressed to Norman himself, where he was at school.",boyish shrink stranger wish give rein servant enter conservatory kindly hand hold gentleman bald smooth forehead soft blue eye gentle pleasant face old son say turn manner acquainted second old long legged fellow say follow question address school 
17,"“At Stoneborough,” said Norman, a little amused at the thought how angry Ethel and Harry would be that the paragraph of the county paper, where “N. W. May” was recorded as prizeman and foremost in the examination, had not penetrated even to Abbotstoke Grange, or rather to its owner’s memory.",say little amused thought angry paragraph county paper record prizeman foremost examination penetrate owner memory 
18,"However, his father could not help adding, “He is the head of the school--a thing we Stoneborough men think much of.”",father help add head school thing man think much 
19,"This, and Mr. Rivers’s civil answer, made Norman so hot, that he did not notice much in passing through a hall full of beautiful vases, stuffed birds, busts, etc., tastefully arranged, and he did not look up till they were entering a handsome dining-room, where a small square table was laid out for luncheon near a noble fire.",civil answer make hot notice much pass hall full beautiful vase stuff bird bust etc. arrange look enter handsome dining room small square table lay luncheon noble fire 
20,"The two ladies were there, and Mr. Rivers introduced them as his daughter and Mrs. Larpent. It was the most luxurious meal that Norman had ever seen, the plate, the porcelain, and all the appointments of the table so elegant, and the viands, all partaking of the Christmas character, and of a recherche delicate description quite new to him. He had to serve as his father’s right hand, and was so anxious to put everything as Dr. May liked it, and without attracting notice, that he hardly saw or listened till Dr. May began to admire a fine Claude on the opposite wall, and embarked in a picture discussion. The doctor had much taste for art, and had made the most of his opportunities of seeing paintings during his time of study at Paris, and in a brief tour to Italy. Since that time, few good pictures had come in his way, and these were a great pleasure to him, while Mr. Rivers, a regular connoisseur, was delighted to meet with one who could so well appreciate them. Norman perceived how his father was enjoying the conversation, and was much interested both by the sight of the first fine paintings he had ever seen, and by the talk about their merits; but the living things in the room had more of his attention and observation, especially the young lady who sat at the head of the table; a girl about his own age; she was on a very small scale, and seemed to him like a fairy, in the airy lightness and grace of her movements, and the blithe gladsomeness of her gestures and countenance. Form and features, though perfectly healthful and brisk, had the peculiar finish and delicacy of a miniature painting, and were enhanced by the sunny glance of her dark soft smiling eyes. Her hair was in black silky braids, and her dress, with its gaiety of well-assorted colour, was positively refreshing to his eye, so long accustomed to the deep mourning of his sisters. A little Italian greyhound, perfectly white, was at her side, making infinite variations of the line of beauty and grace, with its elegant outline, and S-like tail, as it raised its slender nose in hopes of a fragment of bread which she from time to time dispensed to it.",lady introduce daughter luxurious meal see plate porcelain appointment table elegant viand partaking character delicate description new have serve father right hand anxious put like attract notice see listen begin admire fine opposite wall embark picture discussion doctor have much taste art make most opportunity see painting time study brief tour time few good picture come way great pleasure regular connoisseur delighted meet appreciate perceive father enjoy conversation interested sight first fine painting see talk merit living thing room have more attention observation young lady sit head table girl own age small scale seem fairy airy lightness grace movement blithe gladsomeness gesture countenance form feature healthful brisk have peculiar finish delicacy miniature painting enhance sunny glance dark soft smile eye hair black silky braid dress gaiety assort colour refresh eye accustom deep mourn sister little italian greyhound white side make infinite variation line beauty grace elegant outline like tail raise slender nose hope fragment bread time time dispens 
21,"Luncheon over, Mr. Rivers asked Dr. May to step into his library, and Norman guessed that they had been talking all this time, and had never come to the medical opinion. However, a good meal and a large fire made a great difference in his toleration, and it was so new a scene, that he had no objection to a prolonged waiting, especially when Mrs. Larpent said, in a very pleasant tone, “Will you come into the drawing-room with us?”",luncheon ask step library guess talk time come medical opinion good meal large fire make great difference toleration new scene have objection prolonged waiting say pleasant tone come draw room 
22,"He felt somewhat as if he was walking in enchanted ground as he followed her into the large room, the windows opening into the conservatory, the whole air fragrant with flowers, the furniture and ornaments so exquisite of their kind, and all such a fit scene for the beautiful little damsel, who, with her slender dog by her side, tripped on demurely, and rather shyly, but with a certain skipping lightness in her step. A very tall overgrown schoolboy did Norman feel himself for one bashful moment, when he found himself alone with the two ladies; but he was ready to be set at ease by Mrs. Larpent’s good-natured manner, when she said something of Rollo’s discourtesy. He smiled, and answered that he had made great friends with the fine old dog, and spoke of his running off to the dinner, at which little Miss Rivers laughed, and looked delighted, and began to tell of Rollo’s perfections and intelligence. Norman ventured to inquire the name of the little Italian, and was told it was Nipen, because it had once stolen a cake, much like the wind-spirit in Feats on the Fiord. Its beauty and tricks were duly displayed, and a most beautiful Australian parrot was exhibited, Mrs. Larpent taking full interest in the talk, in so lively and gentle a manner, and she and her pretty pupil evidently on such sister-like terms, that Norman could hardly believe her to be the governess, when he thought of Miss Winter.",feel walk enchanted ground follow large room window open conservatory whole air fragrant flower furniture ornament exquisite kind fit scene beautiful little damsel slender dog side trip certain skip lightness step tall overgrown schoolboy feel bashful moment find alone lady ready set ease good natured manner say discourtesy smile answer make great friend fine old dog speak running dinner little laugh look delighted begin tell perfection intelligence venture inquire name little tell steal cake wind spirit beauty trick display beautiful australian parrot exhibit take full interest talk lively gentle manner pretty pupil such sister like term believe governess think 
23,"Miss Rivers took up some brown leaves which she was cutting out with scissors, and shaping. “Our holiday work,” said Mrs. Larpent, in answer to the inquiring look of Norman’s eyes. “Meta has been making a drawing for her papa, and is framing it in leather-work. Have you ever seen any?”",take brown leave cut scissors shape holiday work say answer inquire look eye make draw papa frame leather work see 
24,"“Never!” and Norman looked eagerly, asking questions, and watching while Miss Rivers cut out her ivy leaf and marked its veins, and showed how she copied it from nature. He thanked her, saying, “I wanted to learn all about it, for I thought it would be such nice work for my eldest sister.”",look ask question watch cut ivy leaf mark vein show copy nature thank say want learn think such nice work old sister

26,"“Yes,” said Norman. “New fancy work is a great gain to her.”",say new fancy work great gain 
27,"Mrs. Larpent’s sympathetic questions, and Meta’s softening eyes, gradually drew from him a great deal about Margaret’s helpless state, and her patience, and capabilities, and how every one came to her with all their cares; and Norman, as he spoke, mentally contrasted the life, untouched by trouble and care, led by the fair girl before him, with that atmosphere of constant petty anxieties round her namesake’s couch, at years so nearly the same.",sympathetic question soften eye draw great deal helpless state patience capability one come care speak contrast life untouched trouble care lead fair girl atmosphere constant petty anxiety namesake couch year same

30,"Mrs. Larpent asked kind questions whether his father’s arm was very painful, and the hopes of its cure; and he felt as if she was a great friend already. Thence they came to books. Norman had not read for months past, but it happened that Meta was just now reading Woodstock, with which he was of course familiar; and both grew eager in discussing that and several others. Of one, Meta spoke in such terms of delight, that Norman thought it had been very stupid of him to let it lie on the table for the last fortnight without looking into it.",ask kind question father arm painful hope cure feel great friend thence come book read month past happen read course familiar grow eager discuss several other speak such term delight think stupid let lie table last fortnight look 
31,"He was almost sorry to see his father and Mr. Rivers come in, and hear the carriage ordered, but they were not off yet, though the rain was now only Scotch mist. Mr. Rivers had his most choice little pictures still to display, his beautiful early Italian masters, finished like illuminations, and over these there was much lingering and admiring. Meta had whispered something to her governess, who smiled, and advanced to Norman. “Meta wishes to know if your sister would like to have a few flowers?” said she.",sorry see father come hear carriage order rain mist have choice little picture display beautiful early italian master finish illumination be much linger admire whisper governess smile advance wish know sister like have few flower say 
32,"No sooner said than done; the door into the conservatory was opened, and Meta, cutting sprays of beautiful geranium, delicious heliotrope, fragrant calycanthus, deep blue tree violet, and exquisite hothouse ferns; perfect wonders to Norman, who, at each addition to the bouquet, exclaimed by turns, “Oh, thank you!” and, “How she will like it!”",say do door conservatory open cut spray beautiful geranium delicious heliotrope fragrant calycanthus deep blue tree violet exquisite hothouse fern perfect wonder addition bouquet exclaim turn thank like

Thank you with all my heart.”",father reach blossom high quick warm grateful emotion tremble feature voice say kind give poor girl great treat thank heart 
34,"Margaret Rivers cast down her eyes, half smiled, and shrank back, thinking she had never felt anything like the left-handed grasp, so full of warmth and thankfulness. It gave her confidence to venture on the one question on which she was bent. Her father was in the hall, showing Norman his Greek nymph; and lifting her eyes to Dr. May’s face, then casting them down, she coloured deeper than ever, as she said, in a stammering whisper, “Oh, please--if you would tell me--do you think--is papa very ill?”",cast eye half smile shrank think feel left handed grasp full warmth thankfulness give confidence venture question bent father hall show greek nymph lift eye face cast coloured deep say stammering whisper tell think papa ill 
35,"Dr. May answered in his softest, most reassuring tones: “You need not be alarmed about him, I assure you. You must keep him from too much business,” he added, smiling; “make him ride with you, and not let him tire himself, and I am sure you can be his best doctor.”",answer softest reassuring tone alarm assure keep much business add smile make ride let tire sure good doctor

37,"“You must not expect doctors to be absolute oracles,” said he. “I will tell you what I told him--I hardly think his will ever be sound health again, but I see no reason why he should not have many years of comfort, and there is no cause for you to disquiet yourself on his account--you have only to be careful of him.”",expect doctor absolute oracle say tell tell think sound health see reason have many year comfort be cause disquiet account have careful 
38,"Meta tried to say “thank you,” but not succeeding, looked imploringly at her governess, who spoke for her. “Thank you, it is a great relief to have an opinion, for we were not at all satisfied about Mr. Rivers.”",try say thank succeed look governess speak thank great relief have opinion satisfied 
39,"A few words more, and Meta was skipping about like a sprite finding a basket for the flowers--she had another shake of the hand, another grateful smile, and “thank you,” from the doctor; and then, as the carriage disappeared, Mrs. Larpent exclaimed, “What a very nice intelligent boy that was.”",few word skip sprite find basket flower have shake hand grateful smile thank doctor carriage disappear exclaim nice intelligent boy

41,"“Oh, I am sure they are so fond of each other,” said Meta: “didn’t you see his attentive ways to his father at luncheon! And, papa, I am sure you must like Dr. May, Mr. Wilmot’s doctor, as much as I said you would.”",sure fond other say see attentive way father luncheon sure like doctor say 
42,"“He is the most superior man I have met with for a long time,” said Mr. Rivers. “It is a great acquisition to find a man of such taste and acquirements in this country neighbourhood, when there is not another who can tell a Claude from a Poussin. I declare, when once we began talking, there was no leaving off--I have not met a person of so much conversation since I left town.

62,"“Very well on the whole,” was Mr. Wllmot’s answer, while Ethel scrambled in, and tried to make herself small, an art in which she was not very successful; and Norman gave an exclamation of horrified warning, as she was about to step into the flower-basket; then she nearly tumbled out again in dismay, and was relieved to find herself safely wedged in, without having done any harm, while her father called out to Mr. Wilmot, as they started, “I say! You are coming back to tea with us.”",whole answer scramble try make small art successful give exclamation horrify warning about step flower basket tumble dismay relieve find wedge do harm father call start say come tea 
63,"That cheerful tone, and the kindness to herself, were a refreshment and revival to Ethel, who was still sobered and shocked by her yesterday’s adventure, and by the sense of her father’s sorrowful displeasure. Expecting further to be scolded for getting in so awkwardly, she did not venture to volunteer anything, and even when he kindly said, “I hope you were prosperous in your expedition,” she only made answer, in a very grave voice, “Yes, papa, we have taken a very nice tidy room.”",cheerful tone kindness refreshment revival sober shocked yesterday adventure sense father sorrowful displeasure expect further scold get venture volunteer say hope prosperous expedition make answer grave voice papa take nice tidy room

82,"Norman found one story at a time was enough, and relinquished the field, contenting himself with silently helping Margaret to arrange the flowers, holding the basket for her, and pleased with her gestures of admiration. Ethel went on with her history. “The first place we thought of would not do at all; the woman said she would not take half-a-crown a week to have a lot of children stabbling about, as she called it; so we went to another house, and there was a very nice woman indeed, Mrs. Green, with one little boy, whom she wanted to send to school, only it is too far. She says she always goes to church at Fordholm because it is nearer, and she is quite willing to let us have the room. So we settled it, and next Friday we are to begin. Papa has given us two guineas, and that will pay for, let me see, a hundred and twenty-six times, and Mr. Wilmot is going to give us some books, and Ritchie will print some alphabets. We told a great many of the people, and they are so glad. Old Granny Hall said, ‘Well, I never!’ and told the girls they must be as good as gold now the gentlefolks was coming to teach them.

83,"Ethel departed on her father’s coming in to ask Margaret if she would like to have a visit from Mr. Wilmot.

86,"Margaret, in words more adequate to express the possession the project had gained of Ethel’s ardent mind, explained the whole history of it. “I do believe she looks on it as a sort of call,” said she, “and I have felt as if I ought not to hinder her, and yet I did not know whether it was right, at her age, to let her undertake so much.”",word adequate express possession project gain ardent mind explain whole history believe look sort call say feel hinder know right age let undertake much 
87,"“I understand,” said Mr. Wilmot, “but, from what I have seen of Ethel, I should think you had decided rightly. There seems to me to be such a spirit of energy in her, that if she does not act, she will either speculate and theorise, or pine and prey on herself. I do believe that hard homely work, such as this school-keeping, is the best outlet for what might otherwise run to extravagance--more especially as you say the hope of it has already been an incentive to improvement in home duties.”",understand say see think decide seem be spirit energy act speculate theorise pine prey believe hard homely work such school keep good outlet run extravagance say hope incentive improvement home duty

89,"“Moreover,” said Mr. Wilmot, “I think you were quite right in thinking that to interfere with such a design was unsafe. I do believe that a great deal of harm is done by prudent friends, who dread to let young people do anything out of the common way, and so force their aspirations to ferment and turn sour, for want of being put to use.”",say think right think interfere design unsafe believe great deal harm do prudent friend dread let young person do common way force aspiration ferment turn sour want put use

91,"“I am not saying that it is not the appointed discipline for the girls themselves,” said Mr. Wilmot. “If they would submit, and do their best, it would doubtless prove the most beneficial thing for them; but it is a trial in which they often fail, and I had rather not be in the place of such friends.”",say appoint discipline girl say submit do good prove beneficial thing trial fail place such friend

94,"“Indeed I am. There are so many little details that I cannot be always teasing papa with, and yet which I do believe form the character more than the great events, and I never know whether I act for the best. And there are so many of us, so many duties, I cannot half attend to any.

96,"“I like your understanding it,” said Margaret, smiling sadly. “I don’t know whether it is silly, but I don’t like to be pitied for the wrong thing. My being so helpless is what every one laments over; but, after all, that is made up to me by the petting and kindness I get from all of them; but it is the being mistress of the house, and having to settle for every one, without knowing whether I do right or wrong, that is my trouble.”",like understanding say smile know silly like pity wrong thing helpless one lament make petting kindness get mistress house have settle one know do right wrong trouble

100,"“Yes,” said Margaret, pausing; and then, with a sweet look, though a heavy sigh, she said, “It is very odd how things turn out! I always had a childish fancy that I would be useful and important, but I little thought how it would be! However, as long as Richard is in the house, I always feel secure about the others, and I shall soon be downstairs myself.

101,"“I thought so to-day,”--and here the doctor returned, talking of Abbotstoke Grange, where he had certainly been much pleased. “It was a lucky chance,” he said, “that they brought Norman in. It was exactly what I wanted to rouse and interest him, and he took it all in so well, that I am sure they were pleased with him. I thought he looked a very lanky specimen of too much leg and arm when I called him in, but he has such good manners, and is so ready and understanding, that they could not help liking him. It was fortunate I had him instead of Richard--Ritchie is a very good fellow, certainly, but he had rather look at a steam-engine, any day, than at Raphael himself.”",think day doctor return talk pleased lucky chance say bring want rouse interest take sure pleased think look lanky specimen much leg arm call have such good manners ready understanding help like fortunate have good fellow look steam engine day 
102,"Norman had his turn by-and-by. He came up after tea, reporting that papa was fast asleep in his chair, and the others would go on about Cocksmoor till midnight, if they were let alone; and made up for his previous yielding to Ethel, by giving, with much animation, and some excitement, a glowing description of the Grange, so graphic, that Margaret said she could almost fancy she had been there.",have turn come tea report papa fast asleep chair other go midnight let alone make previous yield give much animation excitement glow description graphic say fancy

It is a real bower for a maiden of romance, with its rich green fragrance in the midst of winter. It is like a picture in a dream. One could imagine it a fairy land, where no care, or grief, or weariness could come, all choice beauty and sweetness waiting on the creature within. I can hardly believe that it is a real place, and that I have seen it.”",wonder give see beautiful conservatory real bower maiden romance rich green fragrance midst winter picture dream imagine fairy land care grief weariness come choice beauty sweetness wait creature believe real place see
