2,"For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.",moment leave house night light bed child continue burn nice little night light help wish keep awake see light blink give yawn other yawn close mouth go 
3,"There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT.

8,"Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd.

9,"If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.",think believe think shadow bring other join drop water appall try stick soap bathroom fail shudder pass sit floor cry

43,"“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in the wildest glee.

He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How clever I am!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”",iron say boylike indifferent appearance jump wild glee forget owe bliss think attach shadow clever crow cleverness

48,"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot. “Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy, when I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.”",induce look pretend go fail sit end bed tap foot say withdraw help crow pleased look listen continue voice woman able resist girl use boy

It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to save her life.",say give kiss reply slight primness make cheap incline face drop acorn button hand return face say wear kiss chain neck lucky put chain save life 
56,"When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.",person set introduce customary ask other age like do correct thing ask old happy question ask examination paper ask grammar want ask

So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies.”",hear father mother explain low voice talk become man agitated want man say passion want little boy have fun run live long long time fairy 
60,"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.",give look intense admiration think run know fairy live home life know fairy strike delightful pour question surprise nuisance get way have give hiding spanking like whole tell beginning fairy

66,"Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think where she has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.

This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house.

In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication.
