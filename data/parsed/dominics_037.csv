42,"""Hon. Sir,--I take the liberty of informing you that one of your young gents, which his name is Mister Loman, is a prig.  He's been a regular down at my shop this twelve month, and never paid a farthing for his liquor.  More than that, he's been a-drawing money from me up to thirty-five pounds, which I've got his promissory note due last Micklemas.  He said he was a-going to get a Nightingale or something then that would pay it all off, and I was flat enough to believe him. If that ain't enough, he's a-been and played me nicely over a rod I sold him.  I might have persecuted him over that job but I didn't.  He cracked it to rights, and then tries to pass it back on me for same as when he got it, and if I hadn't a-been a bit sharper nor some folk I should have been clean done.  This is to tell you I ain't a-going to stand it no longer, and if I don't get my money there'll be a rumpus up at the school which won't be pleasant for none of you.  So the shortest cut is to send on the money sharp to your humble servant, Ben Cripps.",take liberty inform young gent name prig regular shop month pay farthing liquor more draw money pound get promissory note due last say go get pay flat believe enough play rod sell persecute job crack right try pass same get bit sharper folk clean do tell go stand get money rumpus school pleasant short cut send money sharp humble servant

46,"""Foolish boy!"" said the Doctor, with a half groan.",foolish boy say half groan 
47,"What little could be done at that late hour was done.  Strict inquiries were made on all hands as to when and where the missing boy was last seen, and it was ascertained that he must have left Saint Dominic's that morning during early class time, when every one supposed him ill in bed with a headache.",little do late hour do strict inquiry make hand missing boy see ascertain leave morning early class time one suppose ill bed headache 
48,"But where had he gone, and with what object?  A telegram was sent to his father, and the reply came back that the boy had not gone home, and that Mr Loman was on his way to Saint Dominic's.  At the Maltby railway station no one had seen or heard anything of him.",go object telegram send father reply come boy go way railway station see hear 
49,"Meanwhile, Mr Rastle had gone down to the Cockchafer to see Cripps. The landlord was not at home, but, said the potboy, was most likely ""up along with the old 'un at the lock-'us.""  From which Mr Rastle gathered there was a chance of seeing Mr Cripps junior at the residence of Mr Cripps senior, at Gusset Lock-house, and thither he accordingly went. Mr Cripps junior was there, sweetly smoking, and particularly amiable.",go see landlord home say potboy likely old un lock 'us gather be chance see junior residence senior house go junior smoke amiable

And here Mr Cripps relapsed into quite a state of righteous indignation.",likely say tell goin get pound pocket young thief say show hurry little bill square relaps state righteous indignation

56,"Mr Rastle took no notice of all this.  He admitted to himself that this man had some reason for being disagreeable, if Loman had really absconded with such a debt as he represented.",take notice admit man have reason disagreeable abscond debt represent 
57,"""Thirty-five pounds,"" continued Cripps, becoming quite sentimental over his wrongs, ""and if you won't believe me, look at this.  This here bit of paper's all I've got in return for my money--all I've got!""",pound continue become sentimental wrong believe look bit paper get return money get

59,"Had Mr Rastle known as much as the reader knows he would not have wasted more time over Mr Cripps.  He would have seen that, whatever had happened to the boy, Mr Cripps's purpose was to make money by it.  But he did not know all, and looked at the bill with mingled astonishment and sorrow as an important piece of evidence.",know much reader know waste more time see happen boy purpose make money know look bill mingle astonishment sorrow important piece evidence

67,"""I tell you what,"" broke in Mr Cripps, in the midst of this meditation, ""I don't want to do nothing unpleasant to you, or the governor, or anybody.  What I say is, you'd better see this little bill put square among you, and then the thing can be kept quiet, do you see?  It would be awkward for you to have a regular shindy about it, my man, but that's what it'll come to if I don't get my money.""",tell break midst meditation want do unpleasant governor say see little bill put square thing keep quiet see awkward have regular shindy man come get money 
68,"This declaration Mr Cripps delivered in a solemn voice which was his nearest approach to earnestness.  But he was mistaken in expecting Mr Rastle to be much affected or overawed by it.  On the contrary, it gave that gentleman a new insight into his acquaintance's character, which decided him that a prolongation of this interview would neither be pleasant nor profitable.",declaration deliver solemn voice near approach earnestness mistaken expect affect overaw contrary give gentleman new insight acquaintance character decide prolongation interview pleasant profitable 
69,"So Mr Rastle abruptly turned and went, much to the regret of Cripps, who had not half spoken his mind yet.",turn go much regret half speak mind 
70,"Returning to the school, the master reported all he had to say, which was not much.  There an anxious night was spent by the masters and the one or two boys who were in their confidence in the matter.",return school master report have say much anxious night spend master boy confidence matter 
71,"The half hope that Loman might return of his own accord before night was quickly dispelled.  Bed-time came, and no signs of him.  Later his father arrived, anxious and excited, and was closeted for some time with the Doctor.",half hope return own accord night dispell bed time come sign father arrive anxious excited closeted time 
72,"Meanwhile everything that could be done at that time of night was done. The Maltby newspapers were communicated with, and the police. Unpleasant as it was, the masters decided the right thing to do was to make the matter known at once, and not damage the chance of the boy's discovery by any attempt to keep his disappearance quiet.",do time night do newspaper communicate police unpleasant master decide right thing do make matter know damage chance boy discovery attempt keep disappearance quiet 
73,"At dawn next day an organised search was begun, and inquiries were started in every direction.  Mr Cripps, among others, once more received the honour of a visit, this time from Mr Loman himself, who, greatly to the astonishment of the worthy landlord, called for his son's promissory note, which, being produced, he paid without a word.  Cripps was fairly taken aback by this unexpected piece of business, and even a trifle disconcerted.  It never suited him to be quite square with anybody, and now that Mr Loman had paid every farthing that could be claimed against his son, he did not like the look of Mr Loman at all, and he liked it less before the interview ended.  For Mr Loman (who, by the way, was a barrister by profession) put his man that morning through a cross-examination which it wanted all his wits to get over creditably. As it was, he was once or twice driven completely into a corner, and had to acknowledge, for the sake of telling one lie, that the last twenty statements he had made had been lies too.  Still Mr Loman kept at him.  Now he wanted to know exactly how often his son had visited the Cockchafer?  When he was there last?  When the time before that?  What he had done during his visits?  Had he played cards?  With whom?  With Cripps?  Had he lost?  Had Cripps won?  Had Cripps gone on letting him run up a score and lose money, even though he got no payment?  Why had Cripps done so?  Where had he expected to get payment from in the end?",dawn next day organised search begin inquiry start direction other receive honour visit time astonishment worthy landlord call son promissory note produce pay word take unexpected piece business trifle disconcert suit square pay farthing claim son like look like less interview end way barrister profession put man morning cross-examination want wit get drive corner have acknowledge sake tell lie last statement make lie keep want know son visit last time do visit play card lose win go let run score lose money get payment do expect get payment end 
74,"Altogether it was hot quarters for Cripps that morning, and once or twice he struck completely, and putting himself on his dignity, declared ""he wasn't a-going to be questioned and brow-beated as if he was a common pickpocket!"" which objection Mr Loman quietly silenced by saying ""Very well,"" and turning to go, a movement which so terrified the worthy publican that he caved in at once, and submitted to further questions.",hot quarter morning strike put dignity declare go question brow beat common pickpocket objection silence say turn go movement terrify worthy publican cave submit further question 
75,"Mr Loman then followed up his advantage by finding out all he could about the companions whom his son had been in the habit of meeting on the occasion of his visits to the Cockchafer.  What were their names, occupations, addresses, and so on?  Cripps, if any one had told him twenty-four hours ago that he would be meekly divulging all this information to any one in his own house, would have scoffed at the idea. But there was something about Mr Loman's voice, and Mr Loman's eye, and Mr Loman's note-book, which was too much for the publican, and he submitted like a lamb.",follow advantage find companion son habit meeting occasion visit name occupation address one tell hour divulg information one own house scoff idea be voice eye note book much publican submit lamb

79,"For a whole day there came no news of the missing boy.  No one could be met who had seen him or heard of him.  Neither in Maltby nor up the river, nor in the country roads round, could any tidings of him be found.  Towards evening those who remained anxiously behind began to entertain fresh fears.  Had the boy been merely running away, some one would surely have seen him or heard of him.  Had anything worse happened to him?",whole day come news missing boy meet see hear river country road tiding find evening remain begin entertain fresh fear boy run see hear have bad happen 
80,"Mr Loman and the police-inspector paid a hurried visit to the boathouse.  Had the boy been there?  No, no one had been there for two days.  They followed the paths through the woods, asking at every cottage and stopping every passer-by.  But no, no one knew anything.  No boat had passed through the lock, no passenger on foot had gone past it.",police inspector pay hurry visit boathouse boy day follow path wood ask cottage stop passer know boat pass lock passenger foot go

Nothing but the heavy rain, which now began to fall dismally upon the roof and windows of the old school-house.",school silent sound hear passage class -room heavy rain begin fall roof window old school house
