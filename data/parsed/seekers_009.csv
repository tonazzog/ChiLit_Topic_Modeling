2,"Being editors is not the best way to wealth. We all feel this now, and highwaymen are not respected any more like they used to be.",editor good way wealth feel highwaymen respect use 
3,"I am sure we had tried our best to restore our fallen fortunes. We felt their fall very much, because we knew the Bastables had been rich once. Dora and Oswald can remember when Father was always bringing nice things home from London, and there used to be turkeys and geese and wine and cigars come by the carrier at Christmas-time, and boxes of candied fruit and French plums in ornamental boxes with silk and velvet and gilding on them. They were called prunes, but the prunes you buy at the grocer’s are quite different. But now there is seldom anything nice brought from London, and the turkey and the prune people have forgotten Father’s address.",sure try good restore fall fortune feel fall know rich remember bring nice thing use be turkey geese wine cigar come carrier time box cand fruit french plum ornamental box silk velvet gild call prune prune buy grocer different be nice bring turkey prune person forget father address

6,‘When did you try that?’ asked Dora quickly. ‘You know I told you it was wrong.’,try ask know tell wrong 
7,"‘It wasn’t wrong the way we did it,’ said Alice, quicker still, before Oswald could say, ‘Who asked you to tell us anything about it?’ which would have been rude, and he is glad he didn’t. ‘We only caught Albert-next-door.’",wrong way do say say ask tell rude glad catch next door 
8,"‘Oh, Albert-next-door!’ said Dora contemptuously, and I felt more comfortable; for even after I didn’t say, ‘Who asked you, and cetera,’ I was afraid Dora was going to come the good elder sister over us. She does that a jolly sight too often.",next door say feel comfortable say ask cetera afraid go come good elder sister do jolly sight 
9,"Dicky looked up from the paper he was reading and said, ‘This sounds likely,’ and he read out--",look paper read say sound likely read

11,"‘I wish we could secure that partnership,’ said Oswald. He is twelve, and a very thoughtful boy for his age.",wish secure partnership say thoughtful boy age 
12,"Alice looked up from her painting. She was trying to paint a fairy queen’s frock with green bice, and it wouldn’t rub. There is something funny about green bice. It never will rub off; no matter how expensive your paintbox is--and even boiling water is very little use.",look painting try paint fairy queen frock green bice rub be funny green bice rub matter expensive paintbox boil water little use 
13,"She said, ‘Bother the bice! And, Oswald, it’s no use thinking about that. Where are we to get a hundred pounds?’",say bother bice use think get pound 
14,"‘Ten pounds a week is five pounds to us,’ Oswald went on--he had done the sum in his head while Alice was talking--‘because partnership means halves. It would be A1.’",pound week pound go do sum head talk partnership mean half

16,     I wonder why Green Bice      Is never very nice.,wonder green nice

18,"‘She might as well give you the hundred pounds while she was about it,’ said Dora.",give pound say

23,"‘Well, she won’t give us fivepence, but if you’d only do as I am always saying, and rescue a wealthy old gentleman from deadly peril he would give us a pot of money, and we could have the partnership and five pounds a week. Five pounds a week would buy a great many things.’",give fivepence do say rescue wealthy old gentleman deadly peril give pot money have partnership pound week pound week buy great many thing 
24,"Then Dicky said, ‘Why shouldn’t we borrow it?’ So we said, ‘Who from?’ and then he read this out of the paper--",say borrow say read paper 
25,"     MONEY PRIVATELY WITHOUT FEES      THE BOND STREET BANK      Manager, Z. Rosenbaum.",money fees bond bank manager

27,‘What does it all mean?’ asked H. O.,mean ask 
28,"‘It means that there is a kind gentleman who has a lot of money, and he doesn’t know enough poor people to help, so he puts it in the paper that he will help them, by lending them his money--that’s it, isn’t it, Dicky?’",mean be kind gentleman have lot money know enough poor person help put paper help lend money 
29,"Dora explained this and Dicky said, ‘Yes.’ And H. O. said he was a Generous Benefactor, like in Miss Edgeworth. Then Noel wanted to know what a note of hand was, and Dicky knew that, because he had read it in a book, and it was just a letter saying you will pay the money when you can, and signed with your name.",explain say say generous want know note hand know read book letter say pay money sign name 
30,‘No inquiries!’ said Alice. ‘Oh--Dicky--do you think he would?’,inquiry say think 
31,"‘Yes, I think so,’ said Dicky. ‘I wonder Father doesn’t go to this kind gentleman. I’ve seen his name before on a circular in Father’s study.’",think say wonder go kind gentleman see name circular study 
32,‘Perhaps he has.’ said Dora.,have say 
33,"But the rest of us were sure he hadn’t, because, of course, if he had, there would have been more money to buy nice things. Just then Pincher jumped up and knocked over the painting-water. He is a very careless dog. I wonder why painting-water is always such an ugly colour? Dora ran for a duster to wipe it up, and H. O. dropped drops of the water on his hands and said he had got the plague. So we played at the plague for a bit, and I was an Arab physician with a bath-towel turban, and cured the plague with magic acid-drops. After that it was time for dinner, and after dinner we talked it all over and settled that we would go and see the Generous Benefactor the very next day. But we thought perhaps the G. B.--it is short for Generous Benefactor--would not like it if there were so many of us. I have often noticed that it is the worst of our being six--people think six a great many, when it’s children. That sentence looks wrong somehow. I mean they don’t mind six pairs of boots, or six pounds of apples, or six oranges, especially in equations, but they seem to think you ought not to have five brothers and sisters. Of course Dicky was to go, because it was his idea. Dora had to go to Blackheath to see an old lady, a friend of Father’s, so she couldn’t go. Alice said _she_ ought to go, because it said, ‘Ladies _and_ gentlemen,’ and perhaps the G. B. wouldn’t let us have the money unless there were both kinds of us.",rest sure course have be more money buy nice thing jump knock painting water careless dog wonder painting water ugly colour run duster wipe drop drop water hand say get plague play plague bit arab physician bath towel turban cure plague magic acid drop time dinner dinner talk settle go see generous next day think short generous like be many notice bad person think great many child sentence look wrong mean mind pair boot pound apple orange equation seem think have brother sister course go idea have go see old lady friend go say go say lady gentleman let have money be kind 
34,"H. O. said Alice wasn’t a lady; and she said _he_ wasn’t going, anyway. Then he called her a disagreeable cat, and she began to cry.",say lady say go call disagreeable cat begin cry 
35,"But Oswald always tries to make up quarrels, so he said--",try make quarrel say 
36,"‘You’re little sillies, both of you!’",little silly 
37,"And Dora said, ‘Don’t cry, Alice; he only meant you weren’t a grown-up lady.’",say cry mean grow lady 
38,"Then H. O. said, ‘What else did you think I meant, Disagreeable?’",say think mean disagreeable 
39,"So Dicky said, ‘Don’t be disagreeable yourself, H. O. Let her alone and say you’re sorry, or I’ll jolly well make you!’",say disagreeable let say sorry make 
40,"So H. O. said he was sorry. Then Alice kissed him and said she was sorry too; and after that H. O. gave her a hug, and said, ‘Now I’m _really and truly_ sorry,’ So it was all right.",say sorry kiss say sorry give hug say _really sorry right 
41,"Noel went the last time any of us went to London, so he was out of it, and Dora said she would take him to Blackheath if we’d take H. O. So as there’d been a little disagreeableness we thought it was better to take him, and we did. At first we thought we’d tear our oldest things a bit more, and put some patches of different colours on them, to show the G. B. how much we wanted money. But Dora said that would be a sort of cheating, pretending we were poorer than we are. And Dora is right sometimes, though she is our elder sister. Then we thought we’d better wear our best things, so that the G. B. might see we weren’t so very poor that he couldn’t trust us to pay his money back when we had it. But Dora said that would be wrong too. So it came to our being quite honest, as Dora said, and going just as we were, without even washing our faces and hands; but when I looked at H. O. in the train I wished we had not been quite so particularly honest.",go last time go say take take be little disagreeableness think good take think tear old thing bit more put patch different colour show b. much want money say sort cheating pretend poorer right elder sister think wear good thing b. see poor trust pay money have say wrong come honest say go wash face hand look train wish honest 
42,"Every one who reads this knows what it is like to go in the train, so I shall not tell about it--though it was rather fun, especially the part where the guard came for the tickets at Waterloo, and H. O. was under the seat and pretended to be a dog without a ticket. We went to Charing Cross, and we just went round to Whitehall to see the soldiers and then by St James’s for the same reason--and when we’d looked in the shops a bit we got to Brook Street, Bond Street. It was a brass plate on a door next to a shop--a very grand place, where they sold bonnets and hats--all very bright and smart, and no tickets on them to tell you the price. We rang a bell and a boy opened the door and we asked for Mr Rosenbaum. The boy was not polite; he did not ask us in. So then Dicky gave him his visiting card; it was one of Father’s really, but the name is the same, Mr Richard Bastable, and we others wrote our names underneath. I happened to have a piece of pink chalk in my pocket and we wrote them with that.",one read know go train tell fun part guard come ticket seat pretend dog ticket go go see soldier same reason look shop bit get brass plate door shop grand place sell bonnet hat bright smart ticket tell price ring bell boy open door ask boy polite ask give visit card name same other write name happen have piece pink chalk pocket write 
43,Then the boy shut the door in our faces and we waited on the step. But presently he came down and asked our business. So Dicky said--,boy shut door face wait step come ask business say 
44,"‘Money advanced, young shaver! and don’t be all day about it!’",money advanced young shaver day 
45,"And then he made us wait again, till I was quite stiff in my legs, but Alice liked it because of looking at the hats and bonnets, and at last the door opened, and the boy said--",make wait stiff leg like look hat bonnet last door open boy say 
46,"‘Mr Rosenbaum will see you,’ so we wiped our feet on the mat, which said so, and we went up stairs with soft carpets and into a room. It was a beautiful room. I wished then we had put on our best things, or at least washed a little. But it was too late now.",see wipe foot mat say go stair soft carpet room beautiful room wish put good thing least wash little late 
47,"The room had velvet curtains and a soft, soft carpet, and it was full of the most splendid things. Black and gold cabinets, and china, and statues, and pictures. There was a picture of a cabbage and a pheasant and a dead hare that was just like life, and I would have given worlds to have it for my own. The fur was so natural I should never have been tired of looking at it; but Alice liked the one of the girl with the broken jug best. Then besides the pictures there were clocks and candlesticks and vases, and gilt looking-glasses, and boxes of cigars and scent and things littered all over the chairs and tables. It was a wonderful place, and in the middle of all the splendour was a little old gentleman with a very long black coat and a very long white beard and a hookey nose--like a falcon. And he put on a pair of gold spectacles and looked at us as if he knew exactly how much our clothes were worth.",room have velvet curtain soft soft carpet full splendid thing black gold cabinet china statue picture be picture cabbage pheasant dead hare life give world have own fur natural tired look like one girl break jug good picture be clock candlestick vase gilt look glasses box cigar scent thing litter chair table wonderful place middle splendour little old gentleman long black coat long white beard hookey nose falcon put pair gold spectacle look know much clothes worth 
48,"And then, while we elder ones were thinking how to begin, for we had all said ‘Good morning’ as we came in, of course, H. O. began before we could stop him. He said:",elder one think begin say good morning come course begin stop say

51,"‘The G. B.,’ said H. O., and I winked at him to shut up, but he didn’t see me, and the G. B. did. He waved his hand at _me_ to shut up, so I had to, and H. O. went on--‘It stands for Generous Benefactor.’",say wink shut see wave hand _me_ shut have go stand generous 
52,"The old gentleman frowned. Then he said, ‘Your Father sent you here, I suppose?’",old gentleman frown say father send suppose 
53,"‘No he didn’t,’ said Dicky. ‘Why did you think so?’",say think 
54,"The old gentleman held out the card, and I explained that we took that because Father’s name happens to be the same as Dicky’s.",old gentleman hold card explain take name happen same 
55,‘Doesn’t he know you’ve come?’,know come 
56,"‘No,’ said Alice, ‘we shan’t tell him till we’ve got the partnership, because his own business worries him a good deal and we don’t want to bother him with ours till it’s settled, and then we shall give him half our share.’",say tell get partnership own business worry good deal want bother settle give share 
57,"The old gentleman took off his spectacles and rumpled his hair with his hands, then he said, ‘Then what _did_ you come for?’",old gentleman take spectacle rumple hair hand say _did_ come 
58,"‘We saw your advertisement,’ Dicky said, ‘and we want a hundred pounds on our note of hand, and my sister came so that there should be both kinds of us; and we want it to buy a partnership with in the lucrative business for sale of useful patent. No personal attendance necessary.’",see advertisement say want pound note hand sister come be kind want buy partnership lucrative business sale useful patent personal attendance necessary

60,"‘Well, you see,’ said Alice, smiling at him to show she wasn’t frightened, though I know really she was, awfully, ‘we thought it was so _very_ kind of you to try to find out the poor people who want money and to help them and lend them your money.’",see say smile show frighten know think _very_ kind try find poor person want money help lend money 
61,‘Hum!’ said the G. B. ‘Sit down.’,say sit 
62,"He cleared the clocks and vases and candlesticks off some of the chairs, and we sat down. The chairs were velvety, with gilt legs. It was like a king’s palace.",clear clock vase candlestick chair sit chair velvety gilt leg king palace 
63,"‘Now,’ he said, ‘you ought to be at school, instead of thinking about money. Why aren’t you?’",say school think money 
64,"We told him that we should go to school again when Father could manage it, but meantime we wanted to do something to restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable. And we said we thought the lucrative patent would be a very good thing. He asked a lot of questions, and we told him everything we didn’t think Father would mind our telling, and at last he said--",tell go school manage want do restore fall fortune say think lucrative patent good thing ask lot question tell think father mind telling last say 
65,‘You wish to borrow money. When will you repay it?’,wish borrow money repay 
66,"‘As soon as we’ve got it, of course,’ Dicky said.",get course say 
67,"Then the G. B. said to Oswald, ‘You seem the eldest,’ but I explained to him that it was Dicky’s idea, so my being eldest didn’t matter. Then he said to Dicky--‘You are a minor, I presume?’",say seem old explain idea old matter say minor presume

74,"Then he talked some more, and at last he said--‘I don’t advise you to enter into that partnership. It’s a swindle. Many advertisements are. And I have not a hundred pounds by me to-day to lend you. But I will lend you a pound, and you can spend it as you like. And when you are twenty-one you shall pay me back.’",talk more last say advise enter partnership swindle many advertisement have pound day lend lend pound spend like pay

77,"Then he took out a sovereign, and held it in his hand while he talked to us. He gave us a lot of good advice about not going into business too young, and about doing our lessons--just swatting a bit, on our own hook, so as not to be put in a low form when we went back to school. And all the time he was stroking the sovereign and looking at it as if he thought it very beautiful. And so it was, for it was a new one. Then at last he held it out to Dicky, and when Dicky put out his hand for it the G. B. suddenly put the sovereign back in his pocket.",take sovereign hold hand talk give lot good advice go business young do lesson swat bit own hook put low form go school time stroke sovereign look think beautiful new one last hold put hand put sovereign pocket

B. put us in and shook hands with us all, and asked Alice to give him a kiss, so she did, and H. O. would do it too, though his face was dirtier than ever. The G.

82,"‘You’ve been to Mr Rosenbaum’s,’ he said.",say 
83,"So we told him all about it. It took a long time, and Father sat in the armchair. It was jolly. He doesn’t often come and talk to us now. He has to spend all his time thinking about his business. And when we’d told him all about it he said--",tell take long time sit armchair jolly come talk have spend time think business tell say

85,"‘Is he a friend of yours, Father?’ Oswald asked. ‘He is an acquaintance,’ said my father, frowning a little, ‘we have done some business together. And this letter--’ he stopped and then said: ‘No; you didn’t do any harm to-day; but I want you for the future not to do anything so serious as to try to buy a partnership without consulting me, that’s all.

91,"‘Well, the fact is, that letter took a weight off my mind.’ I can’t think what he meant--but I am sure the G. B. would be pleased if he could know he had taken a weight off somebody’s mind.

92,"We gave the scent to Dora. It is not quite such good scent as we thought it would be, but we had fifteen shillings--and they were all good, so is the G. B.",give scent such good scent think have shilling good 
93,"And until those fifteen shillings were spent we felt almost as jolly as though our fortunes had been properly restored. You do not notice your general fortune so much, as long as you have money in your pocket. This is why so many children with regular pocket-money have never felt it their duty to seek for treasure. So, perhaps, our not having pocket-money was a blessing in disguise. But the disguise was quite impenetrable, like the villains’ in the books; and it seemed still more so when the fifteen shillings were all spent. Then at last the others agreed to let Oswald try his way of seeking for treasure, but they were not at all keen about it, and many a boy less firm than Oswald would have chucked the whole thing. But Oswald knew that a hero must rely on himself alone. So he stuck to it, and presently the others saw their duty, and backed him up.",shilling spend feel jolly fortune restore notice general fortune have money pocket many child regular pocket money feel duty seek treasure have pocket money blessing disguise disguise impenetrable villain book seem shilling spend last other agree let try way seek treasure keen many boy less firm chuck whole thing know hero rely stick other see duty back
