1,CHAPTER 7. I Go to Bristol,chapter go 
2,"IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures.",long squire imagine ready sea first plan keep carry intend doctor have go physician take charge practice squire hard work live hall charge old gamekeeper prisoner full sea dream charming anticipation strange island adventure brood hour map detail remember sit fire housekeeper room approach island fancy possible direction explore acre surface climb time tall hill call glass top enjoy wonderful change prospect isle thick savage fight full dangerous animal hunt fancy occur strange tragic actual adventure 
3,"So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, ""To be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins."" Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news:",week pass fine day come letter address addition open case absence young obey order find find gamekeeper poor hand read print follow important news

5,"     Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you      are at the hall or still in London, I send this in      double to both places.",dear know hall send double place 
6,"     The ship is bought and fitted.  She lies at      anchor, ready for sea.  You never imagined a      sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two      hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA.",ship buy fit lie anchor ready sea imagine sweeter schooner child sail ton name 
7,"     I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who      has proved himself throughout the most surprising      trump.  The admirable fellow literally slaved in      my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in      Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we      sailed for--treasure, I mean.",get old friend prove surprising trump admirable fellow slave interest say get wind port sail treasure mean 
8,"""Redruth,"" said I, interrupting the letter, ""Dr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.""",say interrupt letter like squire talk 
9,"""Well, who's a better right?"" growled the gamekeeper. ""A pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.""",good right growl gamekeeper pretty rum go squire talk think 
10,At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:,give attempt commentary read 
11,"     Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and      by the most admirable management got her for the      merest trifle.  There is a class of men in Bristol      monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.  They go      the length of declaring that this honest creature      would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA      belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly      high--the most transparent calumnies.  None of them      dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.",find admirable management get merest trifle be class man prejudice go length declare honest creature do money belong sell high transparent calumny dare deny merit ship 
12,"     So far there was not a hitch.  The      workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were      most annoyingly slow; but time cured that.  It was      the crew that troubled me.",be hitch workpeople sure rigger slow time cure crew trouble 
13,"     I wished a round score of men--in case of      natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I      had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much      as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke      of fortune brought me the very man that I      required.",wish round score man case native buccaneer odious have worry deuce find much remarkable stroke fortune bring very man require 
14,"     I was standing on the dock, when, by the      merest accident, I fell in talk with him.  I found      he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew      all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his      health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to      get to sea again.  He had hobbled down there that      morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.",stand dock merest accident fall talk find old sailor keep public house know seafaring man lose health want good berth cook get sea hobble morning say get smell salt 
15,"     I was monstrously touched--so would you have      been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the      spot to be ship's cook.  Long John Silver, he is      called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as      a recommendation, since he lost it in his      country's service, under the immortal Hawke.  He      has no pension, Livesey.  Imagine the abominable      age we live in!",touch pure pity engage spot ship cook long call lose leg regard recommendation lose country service immortal have pension imagine abominable age live 
16,"     Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook,      but it was a crew I had discovered.  Between      Silver and myself we got together in a few days a      company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not      pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of      the most indomitable spirit.  I declare we could      fight a frigate.",sir think find cook crew discover get few day company toughest old salt imaginable pretty look fellow face indomitable spirit declare fight frigate 
17,     Long John even got rid of two out of the six      or seven I had already engaged.  He showed me in a      moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water      swabs we had to fear in an adventure of      importance.,long get rid engage show moment sort fresh water swab have fear adventure importance 
18,"     I am in the most magnificent health and      spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,      yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old      tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.  Seaward,      ho!  Hang the treasure!  It's the glory of the sea      that has turned my head.  So now, Livesey, come      post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.",magnificent health spirit eat bull sleep tree enjoy moment hear old tarpaulin tramp capstan seaward hang treasure glory sea turn head come post lose hour respect 
19,"     Let young Hawkins go at once to see his      mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both      come full speed to Bristol.      John Trelawney",let young go see mother guard come full speed 
20,"     Postscript--I did not tell you that Blandly,      who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if      we don't turn up by the end of August, had found      an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff      man, which I regret, but in all other respects a      treasure.  Long John Silver unearthed a very      competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.  I      have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things      shall go man-o'-war fashion on board the good ship      HISPANIOLA.",postscript tell way send consort turn end find admirable fellow sailing master stiff man regret other respect treasure long unearth competent man mate man name have boatswain pipe thing go man o' war fashion board good ship 
21,"     I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of      substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has      a banker's account, which has never been      overdrawn.  He leaves his wife to manage the inn;      and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old      bachelors like you and I may be excused for      guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the      health, that sends him back to roving.      J. T.",forget tell man substance know own knowledge have banker account overdrawn leave wife manage inn woman colour pair old bachelor excuse guess wife much health send roving 
22,     P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his      mother.      J. T.,stay night mother 
23,"You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble.",fancy excitement letter put half glee despise man old do grumble lament under gamekeeper change place such squire pleasure squire pleasure law old dare much grumble 
24,"The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.",next morning set foot find mother good health spirit captain cause much discomfort gone wicked cease troubling squire have repair public room sign repaint add furniture beautiful armchair mother bar find boy apprentice want help gone 
25,"It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.",see boy understand first time situation think moment adventure home leave sight clumsy stranger stay place mother have first attack tear afraid lead boy dog life new work have opportunity set put slow profit 
26,"The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.",night pass next day dinner afoot road say good bye cove live bear dear old repaint dear last thought captain strode beach cocked hat sabre cut cheek old brass telescope next moment turn corner home sight 
27,"The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time.",mail pick dusk royal heath wedge stout old gentleman spite swift motion cold night air doze great deal very first sleep log hill dale stage stage awaken last punch rib open eye find stand large building city street day break long time 
28,"""Where are we?"" I asked.",ask

30,"Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted.",take residence inn dock superintend work schooner have walk way great delight lay quay great multitude ship size rig nation sailor sing work man high head hang thread seem thick spider live shore life seem sea smell tar salt new see wonderful figurehead ocean see many old sailor ring ear whisker curl ringlet tarry pigtail swaggering clumsy sea walk see many king archbishop delighted

32,"While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.",delightful dream come front large inn meet dress sea officer stout blue cloth come door smile face capital imitation sailor walk
