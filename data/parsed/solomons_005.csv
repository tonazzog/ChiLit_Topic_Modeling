1,CHAPTER IV. AN ELEPHANT HUNT,
2,"Now I do not propose to narrate at full length all the incidents of our long travel up to Sitanda's Kraal, near the junction of the Lukanga and Kalukwe Rivers. It was a journey of more than a thousand miles from Durban, the last three hundred or so of which we had to make on foot, owing to the frequent presence of the dreadful ""tsetse"" fly, whose bite is fatal to all animals except donkeys and men.",propose narrate full length incident long travel junction journey more mile last have make foot ow frequent presence dreadful tsetse fly bite fatal animal donkey man 
3,"We left Durban at the end of January, and it was in the second week of May that we camped near Sitanda's Kraal. Our adventures on the way were many and various, but as they are of the sort which befall every African hunter--with one exception to be presently detailed--I shall not set them down here, lest I should render this history too wearisome.",leave end second week camp adventure way many various sort befall african hunter exception detailed set render history wearisome 
4,"At Inyati, the outlying trading station in the Matabele country, of which Lobengula (a great and cruel scoundrel) is king, with many regrets we parted from our comfortable wagon. Only twelve oxen remained to us out of the beautiful span of twenty which I had bought at Durban. One we lost from the bite of a cobra, three had perished from ""poverty"" and the want of water, one strayed, and the other three died from eating the poisonous herb called ""tulip."" Five more sickened from this cause, but we managed to cure them with doses of an infusion made by boiling down the tulip leaves. If administered in time this is a very effective antidote.",outly trading station country great cruel scoundrel king many regret part comfortable wagon oxen remain beautiful span buy lose bite cobra perish poverty want water stray other die eat poisonous herb call tulip sicken cause manage cure dose infusion make boil tulip leave administer time effective antidote 
5,"The wagon and the oxen we left in the immediate charge of Goza and Tom, our driver and leader, both trustworthy boys, requesting a worthy Scotch missionary who lived in this distant place to keep an eye on them. Then, accompanied by Umbopa, Khiva, Ventvögel, and half a dozen bearers whom we hired on the spot, we started off on foot upon our wild quest. I remember we were all a little silent on the occasion of this departure, and I think that each of us was wondering if we should ever see our wagon again; for my part I never expected to do so. For a while we tramped on in silence, till Umbopa, who was marching in front, broke into a Zulu chant about how some brave men, tired of life and the tameness of things, started off into a vast wilderness to find new things or die, and how, lo and behold! when they had travelled far into the wilderness they found that it was not a wilderness at all, but a beautiful place full of young wives and fat cattle, of game to hunt and enemies to kill.",wagon oxen leave immediate charge driver leader trustworthy boy request worthy missionary live distant place keep eye accompany bearer hire spot start foot wild quest remember little silent occasion departure think wonder see wagon part expect do while tramp silence march front break chant brave man tired life tameness thing start vast wilderness find new thing die travel wilderness find wilderness beautiful place full young wife fat cattle game hunt enemy kill 
6,"Then we all laughed and took it for a good omen. Umbopa was a cheerful savage, in a dignified sort of way, when he was not suffering from one of his fits of brooding, and he had a wonderful knack of keeping up our spirits. We all grew very fond of him.",laugh take good omen cheerful savage dignified sort way suffer fit brooding have wonderful knack keep spirit grow fond 
7,"And now for the one adventure to which I am going to treat myself, for I do dearly love a hunting yarn.",adventure go treat love hunting yarn 
8,"About a fortnight's march from Inyati we came across a peculiarly beautiful bit of well-watered woodland country. The kloofs in the hills were covered with dense bush, ""idoro"" bush as the natives call it, and in some places, with the ""wacht-een-beche,"" or ""wait-a-little thorn,"" and there were great quantities of the lovely ""machabell"" tree, laden with refreshing yellow fruit having enormous stones. This tree is the elephant's favourite food, and there were not wanting signs that the great brutes had been about, for not only was their spoor frequent, but in many places the trees were broken down and even uprooted. The elephant is a destructive feeder.",fortnight march come beautiful bit water woodland country kloof hill cover dense bush idoro bush native call place wait little thorn be great quantity lovely machabell tree laden refresh yellow fruit have enormous stone tree elephant favourite food want sign great brute spoor frequent many place tree break uproot elephant destructive feeder 
9,"One evening, after a long day's march, we came to a spot of great loveliness. At the foot of a bush-clad hill lay a dry river-bed, in which, however, were to be found pools of crystal water all trodden round with the hoof-prints of game. Facing this hill was a park-like plain, where grew clumps of flat-topped mimosa, varied with occasional glossy-leaved machabells, and all round stretched the sea of pathless, silent bush.",evening long day march come spot great loveliness foot bush clad hill lay dry river bed find pool crystal water trodd hoof print game face hill park plain grow clump flat top mimosa vary occasional glossy leave machabell stretch sea pathless silent bush 
10,"As we emerged into this river-bed path suddenly we started a troop of tall giraffes, who galloped, or rather sailed off, in their strange gait, their tails screwed up over their backs, and their hoofs rattling like castanets. They were about three hundred yards from us, and therefore practically out of shot, but Good, who was walking ahead, and who had an express loaded with solid ball in his hand, could not resist temptation. Lifting his gun, he let drive at the last, a young cow. By some extraordinary chance the ball struck it full on the back of the neck, shattering the spinal column, and that giraffe went rolling head over heels just like a rabbit. I never saw a more curious thing.",emerge river bed path start troop tall giraffe gallop sail strange gait tail screw back hoof rattling castanet yard shot good walk have express load solid ball hand resist temptation lift gun let drive last young cow extraordinary chance ball strike full back neck shatter spinal column giraffe go roll head heel rabbit see curious thing 
11,"""Curse it!"" said Good--for I am sorry to say he had a habit of using strong language when excited--contracted, no doubt, in the course of his nautical career; ""curse it! I've killed him.""",curse say good sorry say have habit use strong language excite contract doubt course nautical career curse kill 
12,"""_Ou_, Bougwan,"" ejaculated the Kafirs; ""_ou! ou!_""",ejaculate 
13,"They called Good ""Bougwan,"" or Glass Eye, because of his eye-glass.",call good eye glass 
14,"""Oh, 'Bougwan!'"" re-echoed Sir Henry and I, and from that day Good's reputation as a marvellous shot was established, at any rate among the Kafirs. Really he was a bad one, but whenever he missed we overlooked it for the sake of that giraffe.",re-echoe day reputation marvellous shot establish rate bad one miss overlook sake giraffe 
15,"Having set some of the ""boys"" to cut off the best of the giraffe's meat, we went to work to build a ""scherm"" near one of the pools and about a hundred yards to its right. This is done by cutting a quantity of thorn bushes and piling them in the shape of a circular hedge. Then the space enclosed is smoothed, and dry tambouki grass, if obtainable, is made into a bed in the centre, and a fire or fires lighted.",set boy cut good giraffe meat go work build scherm pool yard right do cut quantity thorn bush pile shape circular hedge space enclose smooth dry tambouki grass obtainable make bed centre fire fire light 
16,"By the time the ""scherm"" was finished the moon peeped up, and our dinners of giraffe steaks and roasted marrow-bones were ready. How we enjoyed those marrow-bones, though it was rather a job to crack them! I know of no greater luxury than giraffe marrow, unless it is elephant's heart, and we had that on the morrow. We ate our simple meal by the light of the moon, pausing at times to thank Good for his wonderful shot; then we began to smoke and yarn, and a curious picture we must have made squatting there round the fire. I, with my short grizzled hair sticking up straight, and Sir Henry with his yellow locks, which were getting rather long, were rather a contrast, especially as I am thin, and short, and dark, weighing only nine stone and a half, and Sir Henry is tall, and broad, and fair, and weighs fifteen. But perhaps the most curious-looking of the three, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration, was Captain John Good, R.N. There he sat upon a leather bag, looking just as though he had come in from a comfortable day's shooting in a civilised country, absolutely clean, tidy, and well dressed. He wore a shooting suit of brown tweed, with a hat to match, and neat gaiters. As usual, he was beautifully shaved, his eye-glass and his false teeth appeared to be in perfect order, and altogether he looked the neatest man I ever had to do with in the wilderness. He even sported a collar, of which he had a supply, made of white gutta-percha.",time scherm finish moon peep dinner giraffe steak roast marrow bone ready enjoy marrow bone job crack know great luxury giraffe marrow elephant heart have morrow eat simple meal light moon pause time thank good wonderful shot begin smoke yarn curious picture make squat fire short grizzled hair stick yellow lock get long contrast thin short dark weigh stone half tall broad fair weigh curious look take circumstance case consideration sit leather bag look come comfortable day shooting civilised country clean tidy dress wear shooting suit brown tweed hat match neat gaiter usual shave eye glass false tooth appear perfect order look neatest man have do wilderness sport collar have supply make white gutta- percha 
17,"""You see, they weigh so little,"" he said to me innocently, when I expressed my astonishment at the fact; ""and I always like to turn out like a gentleman."" Ah! if he could have foreseen the future and the raiment prepared for him.",see weigh little say express astonishment fact like turn gentleman forese future raiment prepare 
18,"Well, there we three sat yarning away in the beautiful moonlight, and watching the Kafirs a few yards off sucking their intoxicating ""daccha"" from a pipe of which the mouthpiece was made of the horn of an eland, till one by one they rolled themselves up in their blankets and went to sleep by the fire, that is, all except Umbopa, who was a little apart, his chin resting on his hand, and thinking deeply. I noticed that he never mixed much with the other Kafirs.",sit yarn beautiful moonlight watch few yard suck intoxicating daccha pipe mouthpiece make horn eland roll blanket go sleep fire little chin rest hand think notice mix much other 
19,"Presently, from the depths of the bush behind us, came a loud ""_woof_, _woof_!"" ""That's a lion,"" said I, and we all started up to listen. Hardly had we done so, when from the pool, about a hundred yards off, we heard the strident trumpeting of an elephant. ""_Unkungunklovo_! _Indlovu_!"" ""Elephant! Elephant!"" whispered the Kafirs, and a few minutes afterwards we saw a succession of vast shadowy forms moving slowly from the direction of the water towards the bush.",depth bush come loud _woof_ lion say start listen do pool yard hear strident trumpeting elephant elephant elephant whisper few minute see succession vast shadowy form move direction water bush 
20,"Up jumped Good, burning for slaughter, and thinking, perhaps, that it was as easy to kill elephant as he had found it to shoot giraffe, but I caught him by the arm and pulled him down.",jump good burn slaughter think easy kill elephant find shoot giraffe catch arm pull 
21,"""It's no good,"" I whispered, ""let them go.""",good whisper let go 
22,"""It seems that we are in a paradise of game. I vote we stop here a day or two, and have a go at them,"" said Sir Henry, presently.",seem paradise game vote stop day have go say 
23,"I was rather surprised, for hitherto Sir Henry had always been for pushing forward as fast as possible, more especially since we ascertained at Inyati that about two years ago an Englishman of the name of Neville _had_ sold his wagon there, and gone on up country. But I suppose his hunter instincts got the better of him for a while.",surprise push possible ascertain year englishman name sell wagon go country suppose hunter instinct get good while 
24,"Good jumped at the idea, for he was longing to have a shot at those elephants; and so, to speak the truth, did I, for it went against my conscience to let such a herd as that escape without a pull at them.",good jump idea long have shot elephant speak truth go conscience let herd escape pull 
25,"""All right, my hearties,"" said I. ""I think we want a little recreation. And now let's turn in, for we ought to be off by dawn, and then perhaps we may catch them feeding before they move on.""",right hearty say think want little recreation let turn dawn catch feed move 
26,"The others agreed, and we proceeded to make our preparations. Good took off his clothes, shook them, put his eye-glass and his false teeth into his trousers pocket, and folding each article neatly, placed it out of the dew under a corner of his mackintosh sheet. Sir Henry and I contented ourselves with rougher arrangements, and soon were curled up in our blankets, and dropping off into the dreamless sleep that rewards the traveller.",other agree proceed make preparation good take clothes shake put eye glass false tooth trousers pocket fold article place dew corner sheet content rougher arrangement curl blanket drop dreamless sleep reward traveller 
27,"Going, going, go--What was that?",go go go 
28,"Suddenly, from the direction of the water came sounds of violent scuffling, and next instant there broke upon our ears a succession of the most awful roars. There was no mistaking their origin; only a lion could make such a noise as that. We all jumped up and looked towards the water, in the direction of which we saw a confused mass, yellow and black in colour, staggering and struggling towards us. We seized our rifles, and slipping on our veldtschoons, that is shoes made of untanned hide, ran out of the scherm. By this time the mass had fallen, and was rolling over and over on the ground, and when we reached the spot it struggled no longer, but lay quite still.",direction water come sound violent scuffling next instant break ear succession awful roar be mistake origin lion make noise jump look water direction see confuse mass yellow black colour staggering struggle seize rifle slip veldtschon shoe make untanned hide run scherm time mass fall roll ground reach spot struggle lay 
29,"Now we saw what it was. On the grass there lay a sable antelope bull--the most beautiful of all the African antelopes--quite dead, and transfixed by its great curved horns was a magnificent black-maned lion, also dead. Evidently what had happened was this: The sable antelope had come down to drink at the pool where the lion--no doubt the same which we had heard--was lying in wait. While the antelope drank, the lion had sprung upon him, only to be received upon the sharp curved horns and transfixed. Once before I saw a similar thing happen. Then the lion, unable to free himself, had torn and bitten at the back and neck of the bull, which, maddened with fear and pain, had rushed on until it dropped dead.",see grass lay sable antelope bull beautiful african antelope dead transfixe great curved horn magnificent black mane lion dead happen sable antelope come drink pool lion doubt same hear lie wait antelope drink lion spring receive sharp curved horn transfixe see similar thing happen lion unable free tear bit back neck bull madden fear pain rush drop dead 
30,"As soon as we had examined the beasts sufficiently we called the Kafirs, and between us managed to drag their carcases up to the scherm. After that we went in and lay down, to wake no more till dawn.",examine beast call manage drag carcase scherm go lay wake more dawn 
31,"With the first light we were up and making ready for the fray. We took with us the three eight-bore rifles, a good supply of ammunition, and our large water-bottles, filled with weak cold tea, which I have always found the best stuff to shoot on. After swallowing a little breakfast we started, Umbopa, Khiva, and Ventvögel accompanying us. The other Kafirs we left with instructions to skin the lion and the sable antelope, and to cut up the latter.",first light make ready fray take bore rifle good supply ammunition large water bottle fill weak cold tea find good stuff shoot swallow little breakfast start accompany other leave instruction skin lion sable antelope cut latter 
32,"We had no difficulty in finding the broad elephant trail, which Ventvögel, after examination, pronounced to have been made by between twenty and thirty elephants, most of them full-grown bulls. But the herd had moved on some way during the night, and it was nine o'clock, and already very hot, before, by the broken trees, bruised leaves and bark, and smoking droppings, we knew that we could not be far from them.",have difficulty find broad elephant trail examination pronounce make elephant most full grow bull herd move way night o'clock hot break tree bruise leave bark smoking dropping know 
33,"Presently we caught sight of the herd, which numbered, as Ventvögel had said, between twenty and thirty, standing in a hollow, having finished their morning meal, and flapping their great ears. It was a splendid sight, for they were only about two hundred yards from us. Taking a handful of dry grass, I threw it into the air to see how the wind was; for if once they winded us I knew they would be off before we could get a shot. Finding that, if anything, it blew from the elephants to us, we crept on stealthily, and thanks to the cover managed to get within forty yards or so of the great brutes. Just in front of us, and broadside on, stood three splendid bulls, one of them with enormous tusks. I whispered to the others that I would take the middle one; Sir Henry covering the elephant to the left, and Good the bull with the big tusks.",catch sight herd number say stand hollow finish morning meal flap great ear splendid sight yard take handful dry grass throw air see wind wind know get shot find blow elephant creep thanks cover manage get yard great brute front broadside stand splendid bull enormous tusk whisper other take middle one cover elephant left good bull big tusk 
34,"""Now,"" I whispered.",whisper 
35,"Boom! boom! boom! went the three heavy rifles, and down came Sir Henry's elephant dead as a hammer, shot right through the heart. Mine fell on to its knees and I thought that he was going to die, but in another moment he was up and off, tearing along straight past me. As he went I gave him the second barrel in the ribs, and this brought him down in good earnest. Hastily slipping in two fresh cartridges I ran close up to him, and a ball through the brain put an end to the poor brute's struggles. Then I turned to see how Good had fared with the big bull, which I had heard screaming with rage and pain as I gave mine its quietus. On reaching the captain I found him in a great state of excitement. It appeared that on receiving the bullet the bull had turned and come straight for his assailant, who had barely time to get out of his way, and then charged on blindly past him, in the direction of our encampment. Meanwhile the herd had crashed off in wild alarm in the other direction.",boom boom boom go heavy rifle come elephant dead hammer shoot heart fall knee think go die moment tear go give second barrel rib bring good earnest slip fresh cartridge run ball brain put end poor brute struggle turn see fare big bull hear scream rage pain give quietus reach captain find great state excitement appear receive bullet bull turn come assailant have time get way charge direction encampment herd crash wild alarm other direction 
36,"For awhile we debated whether to go after the wounded bull or to follow the herd, and finally deciding for the latter alternative, departed, thinking that we had seen the last of those big tusks. I have often wished since that we had. It was easy work to follow the elephants, for they had left a trail like a carriage road behind them, crushing down the thick bush in their furious flight as though it were tambouki grass.",debate go wound bull follow herd decide latter alternative depart think see last big tusk wish have easy work follow elephant leave trail carriage road crush thick bush furious flight tambouki grass 
37,"But to come up with them was another matter, and we had struggled on under the broiling sun for over two hours before we found them. With the exception of one bull, they were standing together, and I could see, from their unquiet way and the manner in which they kept lifting their trunks to test the air, that they were on the look-out for mischief. The solitary bull stood fifty yards or so to this side of the herd, over which he was evidently keeping sentry, and about sixty yards from us. Thinking that he would see or wind us, and that it would probably start them off again if we tried to get nearer, especially as the ground was rather open, we all aimed at this bull, and at my whispered word, we fired. The three shots took effect, and down he went dead. Again the herd started, but unfortunately for them about a hundred yards further on was a nullah, or dried-out water track, with steep banks, a place very much resembling the one where the Prince Imperial was killed in Zululand. Into this the elephants plunged, and when we reached the edge we found them struggling in wild confusion to get up the other bank, filling the air with their screams, and trumpeting as they pushed one another aside in their selfish panic, just like so many human beings. Now was our opportunity, and firing away as quickly as we could load, we killed five of the poor beasts, and no doubt should have bagged the whole herd, had they not suddenly given up their attempts to climb the bank and rushed headlong down the nullah. We were too tired to follow them, and perhaps also a little sick of slaughter, eight elephants being a pretty good bag for one day.",come matter struggle broil sun hour find exception bull stand see unquiet way manner keep lift trunk test air look mischief solitary bull stand yard side herd keep sentry yard think see wind start try get nearer ground open aim bull whisper word fire shot take effect go dead herd start yard nullah dry out water track steep bank place resemble one kill elephant plunge reach edge find struggle wild confusion get other bank fill air scream trumpet push selfish panic many human being opportunity fire load kill poor beast doubt bagg whole herd give attempt climb bank rush headlong nullah tired follow little sick slaughter elephant good bag day 
38,"So after we were rested a little, and the Kafirs had cut out the hearts of two of the dead elephants for supper, we started homewards, very well pleased with our day's work, having made up our minds to send the bearers on the morrow to chop away the tusks.",rest little cut heart dead elephant supper start homeward pleased day work make mind send bearer morrow chop tusk 
39,"Shortly after we re-passed the spot where Good had wounded the patriarchal bull we came across a herd of eland, but did not shoot at them, as we had plenty of meat. They trotted past us, and then stopped behind a little patch of bush about a hundred yards away, wheeling round to look at us. As Good was anxious to get a near view of them, never having seen an eland close, he handed his rifle to Umbopa, and, followed by Khiva, strolled up to the patch of bush. We sat down and waited for him, not sorry of the excuse for a little rest.",re-pass spot wound patriarchal bull come herd eland shoot have plenty meat trotet stop little patch bush yard wheeling look anxious get near view see eland close hand rifle follow stroll patch bush sit wait sorry excuse little rest 
40,"The sun was just going down in its reddest glory, and Sir Henry and I were admiring the lovely scene, when suddenly we heard an elephant scream, and saw its huge and rushing form with uplifted trunk and tail silhouetted against the great fiery globe of the sun. Next second we saw something else, and that was Good and Khiva tearing back towards us with the wounded bull--for it was he--charging after them. For a moment we did not dare to fire--though at that distance it would have been of little use if we had done so--for fear of hitting one of them, and the next a dreadful thing happened--Good fell a victim to his passion for civilised dress. Had he consented to discard his trousers and gaiters like the rest of us, and to hunt in a flannel shirt and a pair of veldt-schoons, it would have been all right. But as it was, his trousers cumbered him in that desperate race, and presently, when he was about sixty yards from us, his boot, polished by the dry grass, slipped, and down he went on his face right in front of the elephant.",sun go reddest glory admire lovely scene hear elephant scream see huge rush form uplift trunk tail silhouett great fiery globe sun next second see else good tear wound bull charge moment dare fire distance little use do fear hit next dreadful thing happen fall victim passion civilised dress consent discard trousers gaiter rest hunt flannel shirt pair veldt schoon right trousers cumber desperate race yard boot polished dry grass slip go face front elephant 
41,"We gave a gasp, for we knew that he must die, and ran as hard as we could towards him. In three seconds it had ended, but not as we thought. Khiva, the Zulu boy, saw his master fall, and brave lad as he was, turned and flung his assegai straight into the elephant's face. It stuck in his trunk.",give gasp know die run second end think boy see master fall brave lad turn flung assegai elephant face stick trunk

44,"As for Good, he rose and wrung his hands over the brave man who had given his life to save him, and, though I am an old hand, I felt a lump grow in my throat.
