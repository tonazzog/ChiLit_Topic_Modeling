And he wants companions too--he has been forced out of boyhood too soon, poor fellow--and Harry gone too. He does not get anything like real relaxation, and he will be better among youths than boys. Stoneborough will never be what it was in my time!”  added the doctor mournfully. “I never thought to see the poor old place come to this; but there--when all the better class send their sons to the great public schools, and leave nothing but riff-raff here, one is forced, for a boy’s own sake, to do the same.”",true have taste judgment lusus naturae say hesitate word head turn want companion force boyhood poor fellow go get real relaxation good youth boy time add doctor think see poor old place come good class send son great public school leave riff raff force boy own sake do same

85,"Norman was, to a certain extent, right with regard to Margaret--her thoughts and interest had been chiefly engrossed by Alan Ernescliffe, and so far drawn away from her own family, that when the Alcestis was absolutely gone beyond all reach of letters for the present, Margaret could not help feeling somewhat of a void, and as if the home concerns were not so entire an occupation for her mind as formerly.",certain extent right regard thought interest engross draw own family go reach letter present help feel void home concern entire occupation mind 
86,"She would fain have thrown herself into them again, but she became conscious that there was a difference. She was still the object of her father’s intense tenderness and solicitude, indeed she could not be otherwise, but it came over her sometimes that she was less necessary to him than in the first year. He was not conscious of any change, and, indeed, it hardly amounted to a change, and yet Margaret, lying inactive and thoughtful, began to observe that the fullness of his confidence was passing to Ethel. Now and then it would appear that he fancied he had told Margaret little matters, when he had really told them to Ethel; and it was Ethel who would linger with him in the drawing-room after the others had gone up at night, or who would be late at the morning’s reading, and disarm Miss Winter, by pleading that papa had been talking to her. The secret they shared together was, of course, the origin of much of this; but also Ethel was now more entirely the doctor’s own than Margaret could be after her engagement; and there was a likeness of mind between the father and daughter that could not but develop more in this year, than in all Ethel’s life, when she had made the most rapid progress. Perhaps, too, the doctor looked on Margaret rather as the authority and mistress of his house, while Ethel was more of a playfellow; and thus, without either having the least suspicion that the one sister was taking the place of the other, and without any actual neglect of Margaret, Ethel was his chief companion.",throw become conscious be difference object father intense tenderness solicitude come necessary first year conscious change amount change lie inactive thoughtful begin observe fullness confidence pass appear fancy tell little matter tell linger draw room other go night late morning reading disarm plead papa talk secret share course origin much doctor own engagement be likeness mind father daughter develop more year life make rapid progress doctor look authority mistress house more playfellow have least suspicion sister take place other actual neglect chief companion 
87,"“How excited and anxious Norman looks!” said Margaret, one day, when he had rushed in at the dinner-hour, asking for his father, and, when he could not find him, shouting out for Ethel. “I hope there is nothing amiss.

127,"Ethel cried, “Now then!” and looked at her father, while Blanche and Mary reiterated inquiries--marriage, and going to sea, being the only events that, in their imagination, the world could furnish. Going to try for a Balliol scholarship! It was a sad falling off, even if they understood what it meant. The doctor’s explanations to Margaret had a tone of apology for having kept her in ignorance, and Flora said few words, but felt herself injured; she had nearly gone to Mrs. Hoxton that afternoon, and how strange it would have been if anything had been said to her of her own brother’s projects, when she was in ignorance.",cry look father reiterate inquiry marriage go sea only event imagination world furnish go try scholarship sad falling understand mean doctor explanation have tone apology keep ignorance say few word feel injure go afternoon strange say own brother project ignorance

They were summoned downstairs to prayers, but went up again at once, and more than an hour subsequently, when their father paid one of his domiciliary visits, there they still were, with their Latin and Greek spread out, Norman trying to strengthen all doubtful points, but in a desperate desultory manner, that only confused him more and more, till he was obliged to lay his head down on the table, shut his eyes, and run his fingers through his hair, before he could recollect the simplest matter; his renderings alternated with groans, and, cold as was the room, his cheeks and brow were flushed and burning.",go do good help encourage excited state restless despair drive sense recollection idea superior power public schoolboy magnify moment summon prayer go more hour father pay domiciliary visit latin greek spread try strengthen doubtful point desperate desultory manner confuse more more oblige lay head table shut eye run finger hair recollect simple matter rendering alternate groan cold room cheek brow flush burn

So run that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.’ And, Norman, that is not the struggle where the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; nor the contest, where the conqueror only wins vanity and vexation of spirit.”",read calm tone say take prayer book know run race run receiveth prize run obtain man striveth mastery temperate thing do obtain corruptible crown incorruptible struggle race swift battle strong contest conqueror win vanity vexation spirit
