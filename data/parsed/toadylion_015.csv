1,CHAPTER XV. TOADY LION PLAYS A FIRST LONE HAND.,lion play first hand 
2, Sir Toady Lion had played a lone hand.,play lone hand 
3,"We left him sitting behind the hedge, secure as the gods above the turmoil of battle. But he could not be content to stay there. He thought of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, his great namesake and hero; and though he wanted to do nothing rash, he was resolved to justify the ginger-beer label Victoria Cross which he wore so proudly on his breast. So he waited till the forces of the town had swept those of Windy Standard from the field. He saw on the edge of the wood Hugh John, resisting manfully to the death, and striking out in all directions. But Toady Lion knew that he had no clear call to such very active exertions.",leave sit hedge secure god turmoil battle content stay think great namesake hero want do rash resolve justify ginger beer label wear breast wait force town sweep windy field see edge wood resist death strike direction know have clear call such active exertion 
4,"Cautiously he returned through his hole in the hedge, and crawling round the opposite side of the Black Sheds, he entered the door which Peter Greg had forced with his cudgel, before he had been interrupted by the arrival of the enemy. Toady Lion ran through a slippery byre in which calves had been standing, and came to an inner division with a low door and a causewayed floor like a pig-pen. He opened this gate by kicking up the hasp with the toe of his boot, and found himself at once in the inmost sanctuary.",return hole hedge crawl opposite side black enter door force cudgel interrupt arrival enemy run slippery byre calve stand come inner division low door causewayed floor pig-pen open gate kick hasp toe boot find inmost sanctuary 
5,"And there, right before him, with a calf's halter of rope about his neck, all healthy and alive, was Donald, his own dear, black, pet lamb Donald, who gave a little bleat of pure delight upon seeing him, and pulled vigorously at the rope to get loose.",calf halter rope neck healthy alive own dear black pet lamb give little bleat pure delight see pull rope get loose 
6,"""Quiet now, Donald! Or they will come back. Stand still, 'oo horrid little beast 'oo, till I get the rope off!""",quiet come stand horrid little beast get rope 
7,"And so, easing the noose gradually, Toady Lion slipped it over Donald's head and he was free.",ease noose slip head free 
8,"Then, very cautiously, his deliverer put his head round the door to see that the coast was clear. Not a soul was to be seen anywhere on the pastures; so Toady Lion slid out and made for the gap in the hedge, sure that Donald would follow him. Donald did follow, but, as luck would have it, no sooner was he through than Cæsar, who had been scraping for imaginary rabbits at the other side of the field, came barking and rushing about over the grass like a runaway traction engine.",deliverer put head door see coast clear soul see pasture slide make gap hedge sure follow follow luck have scrape imaginary rabbit other side field come bark rush grass runaway traction engine 
9,"Now Donald hated big dogs--they rugged and tugged his wool so; as soon therefore as he saw Cæsar he took down the lea towards the island as hard as he could go. He thundered across the wooden bridge, breaking through the fleeing forces of Windy Standard, which were scattered athwart the castle island. He sprinted over the short turf by the orchard, Cæsar lying off thirty yards on his flank. At the shallows by the stepping-stones Donald sheepfully took the water, and was not long in swimming to the other side, the Edam being hardly deep enough anywhere at this point to take him off his feet. In a minute more he was delightedly nuzzling his wet nose into the hand of Janet Sheepshanks, on the terrace of Windy Standard House.",hate big dog rugge tug wool see take lea island go thunder wooden bridge break fleeing force windy scatter castle island sprint short turf orchard lie yard flank shallow step stone take water long swim other side deep point take foot minute more nuzzle wet nose hand terrace windy standard 
10,"""Wi beast, whaur hae ye come frae?--I declare I am _that_ glad to see ye!""",come declare glad see 
11,"But had she known the price which had been paid for Donald's liberty, her rejoicing would quickly have given place to sorrow. It was mid-afternoon on the day of battle and defeat when Toady Lion straggled home, so wet and dirty that he could only be slapped, bathed and sent to bed--which, in the absence of his father, was felt to be an utterly inadequate punishment.",know price pay liberty rejoicing give place sorrow mid-afternoon day battle defeat straggle wet dirty slap bath send bed absence father feel inadequate punishment 
12,"Prissy had long ago fled home with a terrible tale of battle, murder, and sudden death. But she knew nothing of her brother Hugh John, though she had nerved herself to go back to the Black Sheds, suffering grinding agonies of fear and apprehension the while, as also of reproach for deserting him in his hour of need. Mike and Peter were quietly at work in the stable, in momentary dread of being called upon to give evidence.",prissy flead terrible tale battle murder sudden death know brother nerve go black suffer grinding agony fear apprehension while reproach desert hour need work stable momentary dread call give evidence 
13,"The Carters, Sammy and Cissy, had run straight home, and were at that moment undoubtedly smelling of arnica and slimy with vaseline. But there was no trace of the Commander-in-Chief anywhere. General-Field-Marshal Napoleon Smith had vanished from the face of the earth.",run straight home moment smelling arnica slimy vaseline be trace vanish face earth 
14,"[""OH, THE BONNY LADDIE!""]",
15,"Tea-time came and went. He had been known to be absent from tea. Supper-time arrived and overpassed, and then the whole house grew anxious. Ten o'clock came, and in the clear northern twilight all the household were scattered over the countryside seeking for him. Midnight, and no Hugh John! Where could he be? Drowned in the Edam Water--killed by a chance blow in the great battle--or simply hiding from fear of punishment and afraid to venture home? It must have been some stranger entirely unacquainted with General Napoleon Smith who advocated the last explanation. The inmates of Windy Standard cherished no such foolish hopes.",tea time come go know absent tea supper time arrive overpass whole house grow anxious o'clock come clear northern twilight household scatter countryside seek drown kill chance blow great battle hide fear punishment afraid venture stranger unacquainted advocate last explanation inmate windy cherish such foolish hope 
16,"The sun rose soon after two on as glorious a summer morning as ever shone upon the hills of the Border. As his beams overshot Brown Gattonside to the east they fell on Janet Sheepshanks. Her decent white cap was green-moulded with the moss of the woods; the drip of waterside caves had grimed it, the cobwebs of murky outhouses festooned it. Her abundant grey hair hung down in untended witch locks. She had not shut an eye nor lain down all night.",sun rise glorious summer morning shine hill beam overshot east fall decent white cap green mould moss wood drip waterside cave grime cobweb murky outhouse festoon abundant grey hair hang untended witch lock shut eye lain night 
17,Now she leaned her head on her hands and sobbed aloud.,learn head hand sobb 
18,"""Oh, the bonny laddie! Whatever will I say to his faither when he comes hame? His auldest son and the aipple o' his e'e! My certie, if the ill-set loon were to come up the road the noo, I wad thresh the very skin aff his banes! To think that he should bide awa' like this. Oh, the dear, dear lamb that he is; and will thae auld e'en never mair rest on his bonnie face? Cauld, cauld noo it looks up frae the bottom o' some pool in the Edam Water!""",bonny laddie say faither come hame auldest son aipple e'e certie ill set loon come road wake thresh very skin bane think bide awa dear dear lamb mair rest bonnie face cauld look bottom pool 
19,"And Janet Sheepshanks, like one of the mothers in Ramah, lifted up her voice and wept with the weeping which will not be comforted; for oft-times bairns' play brings that which is not bairns' play to those who love them.",mother lift voice goot weeping comfort oft time bairn play bring bairn play love
