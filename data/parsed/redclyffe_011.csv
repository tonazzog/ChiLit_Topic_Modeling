3," In another week Mr. Edmonstone and his eldest daughter were to depart on their Irish journey. Laura, besides the natural pain in leaving home, was sorry to be no longer near Philip, especially as it was not likely that he would be still at Broadstone on their return; yet she was so restless and dissatisfied, that any change was welcome, and the fear of betraying herself almost took away the pleasure of his presence.",week old daughter depart irish journey natural pain leave home sorry likely return restless dissatisfied change welcome fear betray take pleasure presence

21,"Mr. Edmonstone returned, out of breath, in too much bustle remark his daughter’s blushes. Even when the train was moving off, he still had his head out at the window, calling to Philip that they should expect a visit from him as soon as ever they returned. Such cordiality gave Philip a pang; and in bitterness of spirit he walked back to the barracks. On the way he met Mrs. Deane who wanted to consult him about inviting his cousin, Sir Guy to a dinner-party she intended to give next week. ‘Such an agreeable, sensible youth, and we feel we owe him some attention, he took so much pains to make apologies about the ball.’",return breath much bustle remark daughter blush train move have head window call expect visit return such cordiality give pang bitterness spirit walk barrack way meet want consult invite cousin dinner party intend give next week agreeable sensible youth feel owe attention take much pain make apology ball

28,"These words brought into contrast in Philip’s mind the difference between Guy’s position and his own. The mere possession of wealth was winning for Guy, at an age when his merits could only be negative, that estimation which his own tried character had scarcely achieved, placing him not merely on a level with himself, but in a situation where happiness and influence came unbidden. His own talents, attainments, and equal, if not superior claims, to gentle blood, could not procure him what seemed to lie at Guy’s feet. His own ability and Laura’s heart alone were what wealth could not affect; yet when he thought how the want of it wasted the one, and injured the hopes of the other, he recurred to certain visions of his sister Margaret’s, in days gone by, of what he was to do as Sir Philip, lord of Redclyffe. He was speculating on what would have happened had Guy died in his sickly infancy, when, suddenly recollecting himself, he turned his mind to other objects.",word bring contrast mind difference position own mere possession wealth win age merit negative estimation own try character achieve place level situation happiness influence come unbidden own talent attainment equal superior claim gentle blood procure seem lie foot own ability heart wealth affect think want waste one injure hope other recurr certain vision sister day go do lord speculate happen die sickly infancy recollect turn mind other object 
29,"Guy was not much charmed with Mrs. Deane’s invitation. He said he knew he must go to make up for his rudeness about the ball; but he grumbled enough to make Mrs. Edmonstone laugh at him for being so stupid as to want to stay hum-drum in the chimney corner. No doubt it was very pleasant there. There was that peculiar snugness which belongs to a remnant of a large party, when each member of it feels bound to prevent the rest from being dull. Guy devoted himself to Charles more than ever, and in the fear that he might miss the late variety of amusement, exerted even more of his powers of entertainment than Lady Eveleen had called forth.",guy charm invitation say know go make rudeness ball grumble make laugh stupid want stay hum drum chimney corner doubt pleasant be peculiar snugness belong remnant large party member feel bind prevent rest dull guy devote more fear miss late variety amusement exert more power entertainment call 
30,"There were grave readings in the mornings, and long walks in the afternoons, when he dragged Charles, in his chair, into many a place he had never expected to see again, and enabled him to accompany his mother and sisters in many a delightful expedition. In the evening there was music, or light reading, especially poetry, as this was encouraged by Mrs. Edmonstone, in the idea that it was better that so excitable and enthusiastic a person as Guy should have his objects of admiration tested by Charles’s love of ridicule.",be grave reading morning long walk afternoon drag chair many place expect see enable accompany mother sister many delightful expedition evening be music light reading poetry encourage idea good excitable enthusiastic person have object admiration test love ridicule 
31,"Mr. Edmonstone had left to Guy the office of keeping the 1st of September, one which he greatly relished. Indeed, when he thought of his own deserted manors, he was heard to exclaim, in commiseration for the neglect, ‘Poor partridges!’ The Hollywell shooting was certainly not like that at Redclyffe, where he could hardly walk out of his own grounds, whereas here he had to bear in mind so many boundaries, that Philip was expecting to have to help him out of some direful scrape. He had generally walked over the whole extent, and assured himself that the birds were very wild, and Bustle the best of dogs, before breakfast, so as to be ready for all the occupations of the day. He could scarcely be grateful when the neighbours, thinking it must be very dull for him to be left alone with Mrs. Edmonstone and her crippled son, used to ask him to shoot or dine. He always lamented at first, and ended by enjoying himself.",leave office keep 1st relish think own desert manor hear exclaim commiseration neglect poor partridge shooting walk own grounds have bear mind many boundary expect have help direful scrape walk whole extent assure bird wild bustle good dog breakfast ready occupation day grateful neighbour think dull leave alone crippled son use ask shoot dine lament first end enjoy 
32,"One night, he came home, in such a state of eagerness, that he must needs tell his good news; and, finding no one in the drawing-room, he ran up-stairs, opened Charles’s door, and exclaimed--‘There’s to be a concert at Broadstone!’ Then perceiving that Charles was fast asleep, he retreated noiselessly, reserving his rejoicings till morning, when it appeared that Charles had heard, but had woven the announcement into a dream.",night come state eagerness need tell good news find draw room run stair open door exclaim be be concert perceive fast asleep retreat reserve rejoicing morning appear hear wove announcement dream 
33,"This concert filled Guy’s head. His only grief was that it was to be in the evening, so that Charles could not go to it; and his wonder was not repressed at finding that Philip did not mean to favour it with his presence, since Guy would suffice for squire to Mrs. Edmonstone and her daughters.",concert fill guy head only grief evening go wonder repress find mean favour presence guy suffice squire daughter 
34,"In fact, Philip was somewhat annoyed by the perpetual conversation about the concert, and on the day on which it was to take place resolved on making a long expedition to visit the ruins of an old abbey, far out of all reports of it. As he was setting out, he was greeted, in a very loud voice, by Mr. Gordon.",fact annoy perpetual conversation concert day take place resolve make long expedition visit ruin old abbey report set greet loud voice

In the midst of it, while Amy was intent on the Italian words of a song, Guy touched her hand, and pointed to a line in the programme--",enter different temper enjoy concert other midst intent italian word song touch hand point line programme

I wish Mr. Edmonstone was at home. I hope no harm will come of it. I wonder what I ought to do. Shall I caution him? No; I don’t think I can spoil his happiness--and perhaps the man may be improved.

He had just dismounted before the inn-yard, when a boy put a note into his hand, and he was so absorbed in its contents, that he did not perceive Philip till after two greetings had passed unheard.

76,"The conversation was long, for there was much to hear. Mr. Dixon had kept up a correspondence at long intervals with Markham, from whom he heard that his sister’s child survived, and was kindly treated by his grandfather; and inquiring again on the death of old Sir Guy, learnt that he was gone to live with his guardian, whose name, and residence Markham had not thought fit to divulge. He had been much rejoiced to hear his name from the music-master, and he went on to tell how he had been misled by the name of Morville into addressing the captain, who had a good deal of general resemblance to Guy’s father, a fine tall young man, of the same upright, proud deportment. He supposed he was the son of the Archdeacon, and remembering how strongly his own proceedings had been discountenanced at Stylehurst, had been much disconcerted, and deeming the encounter a bad omen, had used more caution in his advances to his nephew. It was from sincere affection that he sought his acquaintance, though very doubtful as to the reception he might meet, and was both delighted and surprised at such unembarrassed, open-hearted affection.",conversation long be much hear keep correspondence long interval hear sister child survive treat grandfather inquire death old learn gone live guardian name residence think fit divulge rejoice hear name music master go tell misl name address captain have good deal general resemblance father fine tall young man same upright proud deportment suppose son remember own proceedings discountenance disconcert deem encounter bad omen use more caution advance nephew sincere affection seek acquaintance doubtful reception meet delighted surprise such unembarrassed open hearted affection 
77,"The uncle and nephew were not made to understand each other. Sebastian Dixon was a man of little education, and when, in early youth, his talents had placed him high in his own line, he had led a careless, extravagant life. Though an evil friend, and fatal counsellor, he had been truly attached to Guy’s father, and the secret engagement, and runaway marriage with his beautiful sister, had been the romance of his life, promoted by him with no selfish end. He was a proud and passionate man, and resenting Sir Guy’s refusal to receive his sister as a daughter, almost as much as Sir Guy was incensed at the marriage, had led his brother-in-law to act in a manner which cut off the hope of reconciliation, and obliged Archdeacon Morville to give up his cause. He had gloried in supporting his sister and her husband, and enabling them to set the old baronet at defiance. But young Morville’s territorial pride could not brook that he should be maintained, and especially that his child, the heir of Redclyffe, should be born while he was living at the expense of a musician. This feeling, aided by a yearning for home, and a secret love for his father, mastered his resentment; he took his resolution, quarrelled with Dixon, and carried off his wife, bent with desperation on forcing his father into receiving her.",uncle nephew make understand other man little education early youth talent place high own line lead careless extravagant life evil friend fatal counsellor attach father secret engagement runaway marriage beautiful sister romance life promote selfish end proud passionate man resent refusal receive sister daughter much incense marriage lead brother law act manner cut hope reconciliation oblige give cause glory support sister husband enable set old baronet defiance young territorial pride briok maintain child heir bear live expense musician feeling aid yearn home secret love father master resentment take resolution quarrell carry wife bend desperation force father receive 
78,"Sebastian had not surmounted his anger at this step when he learnt its fatal consequences. Ever since that time, nothing had prospered with him: he had married and sunk himself lower, and though he had an excellent engagement, the days were past when he was the fashion, and his gains and his triumphs were not what they had been. He had a long list of disappointments and jealousies with which to entertain Guy, who, on his side, though resolved to like him, and dreading to be too refined to be friends with his relations, could not feel as thoroughly pleased as he intended to have been.",surmount anger step learn fatal consequence time prosper marry sink low have excellent engagement day past fashion gain triumph have long list disappointment jealousy entertain side resolve like dread refine friend relation feel pleased intend 
79,"Music was, however, a subject on which they could meet with equal enthusiasm, and by means of this, together with the aid of his own imagination, Guy contrived to be very happy. He stayed with his uncle as long as he could, and promised to spend a day with him in London, on his way to Oxford, in October.",music subject meet equal enthusiasm means aid own imagination guy contrive happy stay uncle promise spend day way

Bewildered between them, he took them to his sister, who, being as puzzle-headed as himself, and only hearing his involved history of the affair, confused him still more; so he wrote to Philip, saying he was sorry the fellow had turned up, but he would guard against him.
