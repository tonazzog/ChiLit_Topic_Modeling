2," IN the long winter evenings, when we had the picture-books out on the floor, and sprawled together over them with elbows deep in the hearth-rug, the first business to be gone through was the process of allotment. All the characters in the pictures had to be assigned and dealt out among us, according to seniority, as far as they would go. When once that had been satisfactorily completed, the story was allowed to proceed; and thereafter, in addition to the excitement of the plot, one always possessed a personal interest in some particular member of the cast, whose successes or rebuffs one took as so much private gain or loss.",long winter evening have picture book floor sprawl elbow deep hearth rug first business go process allotment character picture have assign deal accord seniority go complete story allow proceed addition excitement plot possess personal interest particular member cast success rebuff take much private gain loss 
3,"For Edward this was satisfactory enough. Claiming his right of the eldest, he would annex the hero in the very frontispiece, and for the rest of the story his career, if chequered at intervals, was sure of heroic episodes and a glorious close. But his juniors, who had to put up with characters of a clay more mixed--nay, sometimes with undiluted villany--were hard put to it on occasion to defend their other selves (as it was strict etiquette to do) from ignominy perhaps only too justly merited.",satisfactory claim right old annex hero very frontispiece rest story career chequer interval sure heroic episode glorious close junior have put character clay mix undiluted villany hard put occasion defend other selve strict etiquette do ignominy merite 
4,"Edward was indeed a hopeless grabber. In the ""Buffalo-book,"" for instance (so named from the subject of its principal picture, though indeed it dealt with varied slaughter in every zone), Edward was the stalwart, bearded figure, with yellow leggings and a powder-horn, who undauntedly discharged the fatal bullet into the shoulder of the great bull bison, charging home to within a yard of his muzzle. To me was allotted the subsidiary character of the friend who had succeeded in bringing down a cow; while Harold had to be content to hold Edward's spare rifle in the background, with evident signs of uneasiness. Farther on, again, where the magnificent chamois sprang rigid into mid-air, Edward, crouched dizzily against the precipice-face, was the sportsman from whose weapon a puff of white smoke was floating away. A bare-kneed guide was all that fell to my share, while poor Harold had to take the boy with the haversack, or abandon, for this occasion at least, all Alpine ambitions.",hopeless grabber book instance name subject principal picture deal varied slaughter zone stalwart bearded figure yellow legging powder horn discharge fatal bullet shoulder great bull bison charge yard muzzle allot subsidiary character friend succeed bring cow have content hold spare rifle background evident sign uneasiness magnificent chamois spring rigid mid-air crouch precipice face sportsman weapon puff white smoke float bare kneed guide fall share poor have take boy haversack abandon occasion least ambition 
5,"Of course the girls fared badly in this book, and it was not surprising that they preferred the ""Pilgrim's Progress"" (for instance), where women had a fair show, and there was generally enough of 'em to go round; or a good fairy story, wherein princesses met with a healthy appreciation. But indeed we were all best pleased with a picture wherein the characters just fitted us, in number, sex, and qualifications; and this, to us, stood for artistic merit.",course girl fare book surprising prefer instance woman have fair show be enough go good fairy story princess meet healthy appreciation pleased picture character fit number sex qualification stand artistic merit 
6,"All the Christmas numbers, in their gilt frames on the nursery-wall, had been gone through and allotted long ago; and in these, sooner or later, each one of us got a chance to figure in some satisfactory and brightly coloured situation. Few of the other pictures about the house afforded equal facilities. They were generally wanting in figures, and even when these were present they lacked dramatic interest. In this picture that I have to speak about, although the characters had a stupid way of not doing anything, and apparently not wanting to do anything, there was at least a sufficiency of them; so in due course they were allotted, too.",number gilt frame nursery wall go allot one get chance figure satisfactory coloured situation few other picture house afford equal facility want figure present lack dramatic interest picture have speak character have stupid way do want do be least sufficiency due course allot 
7,"In itself the picture, which--in its ebony and tortoise-shell frame--hung in a corner of the dining-room, had hitherto possessed no special interest for us, and would probably never have been dealt with at all but for a revolt of the girls against a succession of books on sport, in which the illustrator seemed to have forgotten that there were such things as women in the world. Selina accordingly made for it one rainy morning, and announced that she was the lady seated in the centre, whose gown of rich, flowered brocade fell in such straight, severe lines to her feet, whose cloak of dark blue was held by a jewelled clasp, and whose long, fair hair was crowned with a diadem of gold and pearl. Well, we had no objection to that; it seemed fair enough, especially to Edward, who promptly proceeded to ""grab"" the armour-man who stood leaning on his shield at the lady's right hand. A dainty and delicate armour-man this! And I confess, though I knew it was all right and fair and orderly, I felt a slight pang when he passed out of my reach into Edward's possession. His armour was just the sort I wanted myself--scalloped and fluted and shimmering and spotless; and, though he was but a boy by his beardless face and golden hair, the shattered spear-shaft in his grasp proclaimed him a genuine fighter and fresh from some such agreeable work. Yes, I grudged Edward the armour-man, and when he said I could have the fellow on the other side, I hung back and said I'd think about it.",picture ebony tortoise shell frame hang corner dining room possess special interest deal revolt girl succession book sport illustrator seem forget be such thing woman world make rainy morning announce lady seat centre gown rich flower brocade fall such straight severe line foot cloak dark blue hold jewell clasp long fair hair crown diadem gold pearl have objection seem fair proceed grab armour man stand lean shield lady right hand dainty delicate armour man confess know right fair orderly feel slight pang pass reach possession armour sort want scallop flute shimmer spotless boy beardless face golden hair shattered spear shaft grasp proclaim genuine fighter fresh such agreeable work grudge armour man say have fellow other side hang say think 
8,"This fellow had no armour nor weapons, but wore a plain jerkin with a leather pouch--a mere civilian--and with one hand he pointed to a wound in his thigh. I didn't care about him, and when Harold eagerly put in his claim I gave way and let him have the man. The cause of Harold's anxiety only came out later. It was the wound he coveted, it seemed. He wanted to have a big, sore wound of his very own, and go about and show it to people, and excite their envy or win their respect. Charlotte was only too pleased to take the child-angel seated at the lady's feet, grappling with a musical instrument much too big for her. Charlotte wanted wings badly, and, next to those, a guitar or a banjo. The angel, besides, wore an amber necklace, which took her fancy immensely.",fellow have armour weapon wear plain jerkin leather pouch mere civilian hand point wound thigh care put claim give way let have man cause anxiety come wound covete seem want have big sore wound own go show person excite envy win respect pleased take child angel seat lady foot grapple musical instrument big want wing guitar banjo angel wear amber necklace take fancy 
9,"This left the picture allotted, with the exception of two or three more angels, who peeped or perched behind the main figures with a certain subdued drollery in their faces, as if the thing had gone on long enough, and it was now time to upset something or kick up a row of some sort. We knew these good folk to be saints and angels, because we had been told they were; otherwise we should never have guessed it. Angels, as we knew them in our Sunday books, were vapid, colourless, uninteresting characters, with straight up-and-down sort of figures, white nightgowns, white wings, and the same straight yellow hair parted in the middle. They were serious, even melancholy; and we had no desire to have any traffic with them. These bright bejewelled little persons, however, piquant of face and radiant of feather, were evidently hatched from quite a different egg, and we felt we might have interests in common with them. Short-nosed, shock-headed, with mouths that went up at the corners and with an evident disregard for all their fine clothes, they would be the best of good company, we felt sure, if only we could manage to get at them. One doubt alone disturbed my mind. In games requiring agility, those wings of theirs would give them a tremendous pull. Could they be trusted to play fair? I asked Selina, who replied scornfully that angels _always_ played fair. But I went back and had another look at the brown-faced one peeping over the back of the lady's chair, and still I had my doubts.",leave picture allot exception more angel peep perch main figure certain subdued drollery face thing go time upset kick row sort know good folk saint angel tell guess angel know book vapid colourless uninteresting character straight sort figure white nightgown white wing same straight yellow hair part middle serious melancholy have desire have traffic bright bejewell little person piquant face radiant feather hatch different egg feel have interest common short nosed shock headed mouth go corner evident disregard fine clothes good good company feel sure manage get doubt disturb mind game require agility wing give tremendous pull trust play fair ask reply angel play fair go have look brown face one peep back lady chair have doubt 
10,"When Edward went off to school a great deal of adjustment and re-allotment took place, and all the heroes of illustrated literature were at my call, did I choose to possess them. In this particular case, however, I made no haste to seize upon the armour-man. Perhaps it was because I wanted a _fresh_ saint of my own, not a stale saint that Edward had been for so long a time. Perhaps it was rather that, ever since I had elected to be saintless, I had got into the habit of strolling off into the background, and amusing myself with what I found there.",go school great deal adjustment re-allotment take place hero illustrate literature call choose possess particular case make haste seize armour man want saint own stale saint long time elect saintless get habit stroll background amusing find 
11,"A very fascinating background it was, and held a great deal, though so tiny. Meadowland came first, set with flowers, blue and red, like gems. Then a white road ran, with wilful, uncalled-for loops, up a steep, conical hill, crowned with towers, bastioned walls, and belfries; and down the road the little knights came riding, two and two. The hill on one side descended to water, tranquil, far-reaching, and blue; and a very curly ship lay at anchor, with one mast having an odd sort of crow's-nest at the top of it.",fascinating background hold great deal tiny come set flower blue red gem white road run wilful uncalled loop steep conical hill crown tower bastion wall belfry road little knight come ride hill side descend water tranquil reach blue curly ship lay anchor mast have odd sort crow nest top 
12,"There was plenty to do in this pleasant land. The annoying thing about it was, one could never penetrate beyond a certain point. I might wander up that road as often as I liked, I was bound to be brought up at the gateway, the funny galleried, top-heavy gateway, of the little walled town. Inside, doubtless, there were high jinks going on; but the password was denied to me. I could get on board a boat and row up as far as the curly ship, but around the headland I might not go. On the other side, of a surety, the shipping lay thick. The merchants walked on the quay, and the sailors sang as they swung out the corded bales. But as for me, I must stay down in the meadow, and imagine it all as best I could.",be plenty do pleasant land annoying thing penetrate certain point wander road like bind bring gateway funny galleried top heavy gateway little wall town be high jink go password deny get board boat row curly ship headland go other side surety shipping lay thick merchant walk quay sailor sing swing cord bale stay meadow imagine good 
13,"Once I broached the subject to Charlotte, and found, to my surprise, that she had had the same joys and encountered the same disappointments in this delectable country. She, too, had walked up that road and flattened her nose against that portcullis; and she pointed out something that I had overlooked--to wit, that if you rowed off in a boat to the curly ship, and got hold of a rope, and clambered aboard of her, and swarmed up the mast, and got into the crow's-nest, you could just see over the headland, and take in at your ease the life and bustle of the port. She proceeded to describe all the fun that was going on there, at such length and with so much particularity that I looked at her suspiciously. ""Why, you talk as if you'd been in that crow's-nest yourself!"" I said. Charlotte answered nothing, but pursed her mouth up and nodded violently for some minutes; and I could get nothing more out of her. I felt rather hurt. Evidently she had managed, somehow or other, to get up into that crow's-nest. Charlotte had got ahead of me on this occasion.",broach subject find surprise have same joy encounter same disappointment delectable country walk road flateen nose portcullis point overlook wit row boat curly ship get hold rope clamber swarm mast get crow nest see headland take ease life bustle port proceed describe fun go such length much particularity look talk crow nest say answer purse mouth nod minute get feel hurt manage other get crow nest get occasion 
14,"It was necessary, no doubt, that grown-up people should dress themselves up and go forth to pay calls. I don't mean that we saw any sense in the practice. It would have been so much more reasonable to stay at home in your old clothes and play. But we recognised that these folk had to do many unaccountable things, and after all it was _their_ life, and not ours, and we were not in a position to criticise. Besides, they had many habits more objectionable than this one, which to us generally meant a free and untrammelled afternoon, wherein to play the devil in our own way. The case was different, however, when the press-gang was abroad, when prayers and excuses were alike disregarded, and we were forced into the service, like native levies impelled toward the foe less by the inherent righteousness of the cause than by the indisputable rifles of their white allies. This was unpardonable and altogether detestable. Still, the thing happened, now and again; and when it did, there was no arguing about it. The order was for the front, and we just had to shut up and march.",necessary grow person dress go pay call mean see sense practice reasonable stay home old clothes play recognise folk have do many unaccountable thing _their_ life position criticise have many habit objectionable one mean free untrammelled afternoon play devil own way case different press gang prayer excuse disregard force service native levy impell foe less inherent righteousness cause indisputable rifle white ally unpardonable detestable thing happen be argue order front have shut march 
15,"Selina, to be sure, had a sneaking fondness for dressing up and paying calls, though she pretended to dislike it, just to keep on the soft side of public opinion. So I thought it extremely mean in her to have the earache on that particular afternoon when Aunt Eliza ordered the pony-carriage and went on the war-path. I was ordered also, in the same breath as the pony-carriage; and, as we eventually trundled off, it seemed to me that the utter waste of that afternoon, for which I had planned so much, could never be made up nor atoned for in all the tremendous stretch of years that still lay before me.",sure have sneak fondness dress pay call pretend dislike keep soft side public opinion think mean have earache particular afternoon order pony carriage go war path order same breath pony carriage trundle seem utter waste afternoon plan much make aton tremendous stretch year lay 
16,"The house that we were bound for on this occasion was a ""big house;"" a generic title applied by us to the class of residence that had a long carriage-drive through rhododendrons; and a portico propped by fluted pillars; and a grave butler who bolted back swing-doors, and came down steps, and pretended to have entirely forgotten his familiar intercourse with you at less serious moments; and a big hall, where no boots or shoes or upper garments were allowed to lie about frankly and easily, as with us; and where, finally, people were apt to sit about dressed up as if they were going on to a party.",house bind occasion big house generic title apply class residence have long carriage drive rhododendron portico proppe flute pillar grave butler bolt swing door come step pretend forget familiar intercourse serious moment big hall boot shoe upper garment allow lie person apt sit dress go party 
17,"The lady who received us was effusive to Aunt Eliza and hollowly gracious to me. In ten seconds they had their heads together and were hard at it talking _clothes_. I was left high and dry on a straight-backed chair, longing to kick the legs of it, yet not daring. For a time I was content to stare; there was lots to stare at, high and low and around. Then the inevitable fidgets came on, and scratching one's legs mitigated slightly, but did not entirely disperse them. My two warders were still deep in clothes; I slipped off my chair and edged cautiously around the room, exploring, examining, recording.",lady receive effusive gracious second have head hard talk leave high dry straight back chair long kick leg dare time content stare be lot stare high low inevitable fidget come scratch leg mitigate disperse warder deep clothes slip chair edged room explore examine record 
18,"Many strange, fine things lay along my route--pictures and gimcracks on the walls, trinkets and globular old watches and snuff-boxes on the tables; and I took good care to finger everything within reach thoroughly and conscientiously. Some articles, in addition, I smelt. At last in my orbit I happened on an open door, half concealed by the folds of a curtain. I glanced carefully around. They were still deep in clothes, both talking together, and I slipped through.",many strange fine thing lay route picture gimcrack wall trinket globular old watch snuff box table take good care finger reach article addition smell last orbit happen open door half conceal fold curtain glance deep clothes talk slip 
19,"This was altogether a more sensible sort of room that I had got into; for the walls were honestly upholstered with books, though these for the most part glimmered provokingly through the glass doors of their tall cases. I read their titles longingly, breathing on every accessible pane of glass, for I dared not attempt to open the doors, with the enemy encamped so near. In the window, though, on a high sort of desk, there lay, all by itself, a most promising-looking book, gorgeously bound. I raised the leaves by one corner, and like scent from a pot-pourri jar there floated out a brief vision of blues and reds, telling of pictures, and pictures all highly coloured! Here was the right sort of thing at last, and my afternoon would not be entirely wasted. I inclined an ear to the door by which I had entered. Like the brimming tide of a full-fed river the grand, eternal, inexhaustible clothes-problem bubbled and eddied and surged along. It seemed safe enough. I slid the book off its desk with some difficulty, for it was very fine and large, and staggered with it to the hearthrug--the only fit and proper place for books of quality, such as this.",sensible sort room get wall upholster book most part glimmer glass door tall case read title breathe accessible pane glass attempt open door enemy encamp window high sort desk lay promising look book bind raise leave corner scent pot pourri jar float brief vision blue red tell picture picture coloured right sort thing last afternoon waste inclined ear door enter brim tide full fed river grand eternal inexhaustible clothes problem bubble edd surge seem safe slide book desk difficulty fine large stagger hearthrug only fit proper place book quality such 
20,"They were excellent hearthrugs in that house; soft and wide, with the thickest of pile, and one's knees sank into them most comfortably. When I got the book open there was a difficulty at first in making the great stiff pages lie down. Most fortunately the coal-scuttle was actually at my elbow, and it was easy to find a flat bit of coal to lay on the refractory page. Really, it was just as if everything had been arranged for me. This was not such a bad sort of house after all.",excellent hearthrug house soft wide thickest pile knee sink get book open be difficulty first make great stiff page lie coal scuttle elbow easy find flat bit coal lay refractory page arrange bad sort house 
21,"The beginnings of the thing were gay borders--scrolls and strap-work and diapered backgrounds, a maze of colour, with small misshapen figures clambering cheerily up and down everywhere. But first I eagerly scanned what text there was in the middle, in order to get a hint of what it was all about. Of course I was not going to waste any time in reading. A clue, a sign-board, a finger-post was all I required. To my dismay and disgust it was all in a stupid foreign language! Really, the perversity of some people made one at times almost despair of the whole race. However, the pictures remained; pictures never lied, never shuffled nor evaded; and as for the story, I could invent it myself.",beginning thing gay border scroll strap work diaper background maze colour small misshapen figure clamber scan text middle order get hint course go waste time reading clue sign board finger post require dismay disgust stupid foreign language perversity person make time despair whole race picture remain picture lie shuffle evade story invent 
22,"Over the page I went, shifting the bit of coal to a new position; and, as the scheme of the picture disengaged itself from out the medley of colour that met my delighted eyes, first there was a warm sense of familiarity, then a dawning recognition, and then--O then! along with blissful certainty came the imperious need to clasp my stomach with both hands, in order to repress the shout of rapture that struggled to escape--it was my own little city!",page go shift bit coal new position scheme picture disengage medley colour meet delight eye be warm sense familiarity dawn recognition blissful certainty come imperious need clasp stomach hand order repress shout rapture struggle escape own little city 
23,"I knew it well enough, I recognised it at once, though I had never been quite so near it before. Here was the familiar gateway, to the left that strange, slender tower with its grim, square head shot far above the walls; to the right, outside the town, the hill--as of old--broke steeply down to the sea. But to-day everything was bigger and fresher and clearer, the walls seemed newly hewn, gay carpets were hung out over them, fair ladies and long-haired children peeped and crowded on the battlements. Better still, the portcullis was up--I could even catch a glimpse of the sunlit square within--and a dainty company was trooping through the gate on horseback, two and two. Their horses, in trappings that swept the ground, were gay as themselves; and _they_ were the gayest crew, for dress and bearing, I had ever yet beheld. It could mean nothing else but a wedding, I thought, this holiday attire, this festal and solemn entry; and, wedding or whatever it was, I meant to be there. This time I would not be balked by any grim portcullis; this time I would slip in with the rest of the crowd, find out just what my little town was like, within those exasperating walls that had so long confronted me, and, moreover, have my share of the fun that was evidently going on inside. Confident, yet breathless with expectation, I turned the page.",know recognise familiar gateway left strange slender tower grim square head shoot wall right town hill old break sea day big fresher clear wall seem hewn gay carpet hang fair lady long haired child peep crowd battlement portcullis catch glimpse sunlit square dainty company troop gate horseback horse trapping sweep ground gay gayest crew dress bear beheld mean else wedding think holiday attire festal solemn entry wedding mean time balk grim portcullis time slip rest crowd find little town exasperating wall confront have share fun go confident breathless expectation turn page 
24,"Joy! At last I was in it, at last I was on the right side of those provoking walls; and, needless to say, I looked about me with much curiosity. A public place, clearly, though not such as I was used to. The houses at the back stood on a sort of colonnade, beneath which the people jostled and crowded. The upper stories were all painted with wonderful pictures. Above the straight line of the roofs the deep blue of a cloudless sky stretched from side to side. Lords and ladies thronged the foreground, while on a dais in the centre a gallant gentleman, just alighted off his horse, stooped to the fingers of a girl as bravely dressed out as Selina's lady between the saints; and round about stood venerable personages, robed in the most variegated clothing. There were boys, too, in plenty, with tiny red caps on their thick hair; and their shirts had bunched up and worked out at the waist, just as my own did so often, after chasing anybody; and each boy of them wore an odd pair of stockings, one blue and the other red. This system of attire went straight to my heart. I had tried the same thing so often, and had met with so much discouragement; and here, at last, was my justification, painted deliberately in a grown-up book! I looked about for my saint-friends--the armour-man and the other fellow--but they were not to be seen. Evidently they were unable to get off duty, even for a wedding, and still stood on guard in that green meadow down below. I was disappointed, too, that not an angel was visible. One or two of them, surely, could easily have been spared for an hour, to run up and see the show; and they would have been thoroughly at home here, in the midst of all the colour and the movement and the fun.",last last right side provoke wall needless say look much curiosity public place such use house back stand sort colonnade person jostle crowd upper story paint wonderful picture straight line roof deep blue cloudless sky stretch side side lord lady throng foreground dais centre gallant gentleman alight horse stoop finger girl dress lady saint stand venerable personage robe variegated clothing be boy plenty tiny red cap thick hair shirt bunch work waist own do chase boy wear odd pair stocking blue other red system attire go heart try same thing meet much discouragement last justification paint grow book look saint friend armour man other fellow see unable get duty wedding stand guard green meadow disappointed angel visible spare hour run see show home midst colour movement fun 
25,"But it was time to get on, for clearly the interest was only just beginning. Over went the next page, and there we were, the whole crowd of us, assembled in a noble church. It was not easy to make out exactly what was going on; but in the throng I was delighted to recognise my angels at last, happy and very much at home. They had managed to get leave off, evidently, and must have run up the hill and scampered breathlessly through the gate; and perhaps they cried a little when they found the square empty, and thought the fun must be all over. Two of them had got hold of a great wax candle apiece, as much as they could stagger under, and were tittering sideways at each other as the grease ran bountifully over their clothes. A third had strolled in among the company, and was chatting to a young gentleman, with whom she appeared to be on the best of terms. Decidedly, this was the right breed of angel for us.

26,"Well, no doubt they were now being married, He and She, just as always happened. And then, of course, they were going to live happily ever after; and _that_ was the part I wanted to get to. Story-books were so stupid, always stopping at the point where they became really nice; but this picture-story was only in its first chapters, and at last I was to have a chance of knowing _how_ people lived happily ever after. We would all go home together, He and She, and the angels, and I; and the armour-man would be invited to come and stay. And then the story would really begin, at the point where those other ones always left off.

I was through the town by this time, and out on the other side of the hill, where I had always wanted to be; and, sure enough, there was the harbour, all thick with curly ships. Most of them were piled high with wedding-presents--bales of silk, and gold and silver plate, and comfortable-looking bags suggesting bullion; and the gayest ship of all lay close up to the carpeted landing-stage. Already the bride was stepping daintily down the gangway, her ladies following primly, one by one; a few minutes more and we should all be aboard, the hawsers would splash in the water, the sails would fill and strain. From the deck I should see the little walled town recede and sink and grow dim, while every plunge of our bows brought us nearer to the happy island--it was an island we were bound for, I knew well!
