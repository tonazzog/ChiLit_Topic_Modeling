1,CHAPTER 58.,
2,"For nearly a fortnight, the work upon the stockade continued without any intermission, when a circumstance occurred which created the greatest alarm and excitement.  One day, as the party returned to dinner, Mrs Seagrave said with surprise, ""Why, was not Tommy with you?""",fortnight work stockade continue intermission circumstance occur create great alarm excitement day party return dinner say surprise 
3,"""No,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""he has not been near us all day; he went with us after breakfast, but did not remain a quarter of an hour.""",reply day go breakfast remain quarter hour 
4,"""No, Missy; I tell Massa Tommy to help carry cocoa-nut leaves, and then he go away directly.""",tell help carry cocoa nut leave go 
5,"""Goodness! where can he be?"" exclaimed Mrs Seagrave, alarmed.",goodness exclaim alarm 
6,"""I dare say he is picking up shells on the beach, ma'am,"" replied Ready, ""or perhaps he is in the garden.  I will go and see.""",say pick shell beach reply ready garden go see 
7,"""I see him--oh, mercy!--I see him,"" said Juno, pointing with her finger; ""he in the boat, and boat go to sea!""",see mercy see say point finger boat boat go sea 
8,"It was but too true: there was Tommy in the boat, and the boat had drifted from the beach, and was now a cable's length away from it, among the breakers.",true be boat boat drift beach cable length breaker 
9,"William ran off like the wind, followed close by Mr Seagrave and Ready, and at a distance by Mrs Seagrave and Juno; indeed, there was no time to be lost, for the wind was off the shore, and in a short time the boat would have been out to sea.",run wind follow ready distance be time lose wind shore short time boat sea 
10,"William, as soon as he arrived at the beach, threw off his hat and jacket and dashed into the water.  He was already up to his middle, when old Ready, who had followed him, caught him by the arm and said:",arrive beach throw hat jacket dash water middle old ready follow catch arm say 
11,"""William, go back immediately.  I insist upon it.  Your going can do no good, as you do not understand the thing so well as I do; and go I will, so there will be double risk for nothing.  Mr Seagrave, order him back. He will obey you.  I insist upon it, sir.""",go insist go do good understand thing do go be double risk order obey insist sir 
12,"""William,"" said Mr Seagrave, ""come back immediately, I command you.""",say come command 
13,"William obeyed, but before he was clear of the water Ready had swam across to the first rocks on the reef, and was now dashing through the pools between the rocks, towards the boat.",obey clear water ready swim first rock reef dash pool rock boat 
14,"""Oh, father!"" said William, ""if that good old man is lost, I shall never forgive myself.  Look, father, one--two--three sharks, here, close to us.  He has no chance.  See, he is again in deep water.  God protect him!""",father say good old man lose forgive look father shark close have chance see deep water protect 
15,"In the meantime, Mr Seagrave, whose wife was now by his side, after glancing his eye a moment at the sharks, which were within a few feet of the beach, had kept his gaze steadily upon Ready's movements.  If he passed through the passage of deep water between the rocks he might be considered safe, as the boat was now beating on a reef on the other side, where the water was shallow.  It was a moment of intense anxiety. At last Ready had gained the reef, and had his hands upon the rocks, and was climbing on them.",meantime wife side glance eye moment shark few foot beach keep gaze movement pass passage deep water rock consider safe boat beat reef other side water shallow moment intense anxiety last ready gain reef have hand rock climb 
16,"""He is safe, is he not?"" whispered Mrs Seagrave faintly.",safe whisper 
17,"""Yes; now I think he is,"" replied Mr Seagrave, as Ready had gained a footing on the rocks, where the water was but a little above his ankles. ""I think there is no deep water between him and the boat.""",think reply ready gain footing rock water little ankle think be deep water boat 
18,"In another minute Ready was over the rocks, and had seized the gunnel of the boat.",minute ready rock seize gunnel boat 
19,"""He is in the boat,"" cried William.  ""Thank God!""",boat cry thank 
20,"""Yes, we must thank God, and that fervently,"" replied Mr Seagrave. ""Look at those monsters,"" continued he, pointing to the sharks; ""how quick they swim to and fro; they have scented their prey on the water. It is fortunate they are here.""",thank reply look monster continue point shark quick swim for scent prey water fortunate 
21,"""See, he has the boat-hook, and is pushing the boat off the reef into the deep water.  Oh! he is quite safe now.""",see have boat hook push boat reef deep water safe 
22,"Such, however, was not the case.  The boat had been beating on the rocks of the reef, and had knocked a hole in her bottom, and as soon as Ready had forced the boat into deep water, she began to fill immediately. Ready pushed as hard as he could with the boat-hook, and tearing off his neck-cloth, forced as much as he could of it into the hole.  This saved them; but the boat was up to the thwarts with water, and the least motion on the part of Ready, or even Tommy, would have upset her immediately, and they had still to pass the deep water between the reef and the beach, where the sharks were swimming.  Ready, who perceived his danger, called out to them to throw large stones at the sharks as fast as they could, to drive them away.  This was immediately done by Mr Seagrave and William, aided by Juno and Mrs Seagrave.",such case boat beat rock reef knock hole bottom ready force boat deep water begin fill ready push boat hook tear neck cloth force much hole save boat thwart water least motion part ready upset have pass deep water reef beach shark swim ready perceive danger call throw large stone shark drive do aid 
23,"The pelting of the stones had the desired effect.  The sharks swam away, and Ready passed through to the beach, and the boat grounded just as she was up to the gunnel in water, and about to turn over.  He handed out Tommy, who was so dreadfully frightened that he could not cry.",pelting stone have desire effect shark swim ready pass beach boat ground gunnel water turn hand frighten cry 
24,"As soon as Ready landed, William sprang into his arms, crying, ""Thank God, you are safe, Ready!""  Mrs Seagrave, overpowered by her feelings, sank her head upon William's shoulder, and burst into tears.",ready land spring arm cry thank safe ready overpower feeling sink head shoulder burst tear 
25,"""It was touch and go, William,"" observed Ready, as they walked up to the house, preceded by Mr and Mrs Seagrave.  ""How much mischief may be created by a thoughtless boy!  However, one can't put old heads on young shoulders, and so Tommy must be forgiven.""",touch go observe ready walk house precede much mischief create thoughtless boy put old head young shoulder forgive 
26,"""He has been punished enough, as far as fright goes,"" replied William; ""I'll answer for it, he'll never get into the boat again by himself.""",punish fright go reply answer get boat 
27,"""No, I think not.  But now, William, you saw how nearly I was swamped in the boat; indeed, it was only by his mercy that I was preserved; but taking the question merely as far as our endeavours could help us, do you think that if you had gained the boat instead of me, you would have brought her to the beach as I did?""",think see swamp boat mercy preserve take question endeavour help think gain boat bring beach 
28,"""No, Ready; I never could have managed her so skilfully as you did, and therefore I must have been swamped before I got on shore.""",ready manage swamp get shore 
29,"""Well, William, as I am an old sailor and you are not, therefore it is not vanity which makes me say that you could not have managed the boat so well as I did.  Now, as I had not three or four seconds to spare, you, as you say, must have been swamped.  I mention this to prove to you that I was right in desiring your father to order you back.""",old sailor vanity make say manage boat have second spare say swamp mention prove right desire father order 
30,"""Certainly, Ready; but Tommy is my brother, and I felt that it was more my duty than yours to risk my life for him.""",ready brother feel duty risk life 
31,"""A very proper feeling, William; but you have other duties, which are, to look after your father and mother, and be a comfort and solace to them.  Your life is more valuable than mine.  I am an old man on the brink of the grave, and a year or two makes no difference, but your life is, I hope, of more consequence.""",proper feeling have other duty look father mother comfort solace life valuable old man brink grave year make difference life hope more consequence 
32,"That evening the prayers were more than usually solemn, and the thanksgivings more heartfelt and sincere.  Exhausted with the exciting scene of the day, they all retired early to bed.",evening prayer more solemn thanksgiving heartfelt sincere exhaust exciting scene day retire bed
