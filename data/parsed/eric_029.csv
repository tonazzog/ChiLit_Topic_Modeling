4,"The other day I was staying with Montagu. He has succeeded to his father's estate, and is the best-loved landlord for miles around. He intends to stand for the county at the next general election, and I haven't the shadow of a doubt that he will succeed. If he does, Parliament will have gained a worthy addition. Montagu has the very soul of honor, and he can set off the conclusions of his vigorous judgment, and the treasures of his cultivated taste, with an eloquence that rises to extraordinary grandeur when he is fulminating his scorn at any species of tyranny or meanness.",other day stay succeed father estate love landlord mile intend stand county next general election shadow doubt succeed gain worthy addition have very soul honor set conclusion vigorous judgment treasure cultivate taste eloquence rise extraordinary grandeur fulminate scorn species tyranny meanness 
5,"It was very pleasant to talk with him about our old school days in his charming home. We sate by the open window (which looks over his grounds, and then across one of the richest plains in England) one long summer evening, recalling all the vanished scenes and figures of the past, until we almost felt ourselves boys again.",pleasant talk old school day charming home sate open window look grounds rich plain long summer evening recall vanish scene figure past feel boy

7,"""Is he liked?""",like 
8,"""Yes, very much. He always used to strike me at school as one of those fellows who are much more likely to be happy and successful as men, than they had ever any chance of being as boys. I hope the _greatest_ things of him; but have you heard anything of Duncan lately?""",use strike school fellow likely happy successful man have chance boy hope _greatest_ thing hear 
9,"""Yes, he's just been gazetted as lieutenant. I had a letter from him the other day. He's met two old Roslyn fellows, Wildney and Upton, the latter of whom is now Captain Upton; he says that there are not two finer or manlier officers in the whole service, and Wildney, as you may easily guess, is the favorite of the mess-room. You know, I suppose, that Graham is making a great start at the bar.""",gazett lieutenant have letter other day meet old fellow latter say be finer manly officer whole service guess favorite mess-room know suppose make great start bar

12,"""On the principle, I suppose, of 'Set a thief to catch a thief,'"" said Montagu, with a smile.",principle suppose set thief catch thief say smile 
13,"""Yes; but he exemplifies the truth 'chassez le naturel, il revient au galop' for he was charged with abetting a street fight between two boys, which very nearly ended fatally. However, he was penitent, and Graham got him off with wonderful cleverness.""",exemplify truth charge abet street fight boy end penitent get wonderful cleverness

16,"""Poor boy, he is at peace now,"" said Montagu; and he told me once more the sorrowful particulars of his death. ""Shall I read you some verses?"" he asked, ""which he must have composed, poor fellow, on board the 'Stormy Petrel,' though he probably wrote them at Fairholm afterwards.""",poor boy peace say tell sorrowful particular death read verse ask compose poor fellow board stormy write

26,"Montagu gave me the paper, and I cherish it as my dearest memorial of my erring but noble schoolboy friend.",give paper cherish dearest memorial err noble schoolboy friend 
27,"Knowing how strong an interest Mr. Rose always took in Eric, I gave him a copy of these verses when last I visited him at his pleasant vicarage of Seaford, to which he was presented a year or two ago by Dr. Rowlands, now Bishop of Roslyn, who has also appointed him examining chaplain. I sat and watched Mr. Rose while he read them. A mournful interest was depicted on his face, his hand trembled a little, and I fancied that he bent his grey hair over the paper to hide a tear. We always knew at school that Eric was one of his greatest favorites, as indeed he and Vernon were with all of us; and when the unhappy boy had run away without even having the opportunity for bidding any one farewell, Mr. Rose displayed such real grief, that for weeks he was like a man who went mourning for a son. After those summer holidays, when we returned to school, Montagu and Wildney brought back with them the intelligence of Eric's return to Fairholm, and of his death. The news plunged many of us in sorrow, and when, on the first Sunday in chapel, Mr. Rose alluded to this sad tale, there were few dry eyes among those who listened to him. I shall never forget that Sunday afternoon. A deep hush brooded over us, and before the sermon was over, many a face was hidden to conceal the emotion which could not be suppressed.",know strong interest take give copy verse last visit pleasant vicarage present year appoint examine chaplain sit watch read mournful interest depict face hand tremble little fancy bend grey hair paper hide tear know school great favorite unhappy boy run have opportunity bid farewell display such real grief week man go mourn son summer holiday return school bring intelligence return death news plunge many sorrow first chapel allude sad tale be few dry eye listen forget afternoon deep hush brood sermon many face hide conceal emotion suppress 
28,"""I speak,"" said Mr. Rose, ""to a congregation of mourners, for one who but a few weeks back was sitting among you as one of yourselves. But, for myself, I do _not_ mourn over his death. Many a time have I mourned for him in past days, when I marked how widely he went astray,--but I do not mourn now; for after his fiery trials he died penitent and happy, and at last his sorrows are over for ever, and the dreams of ambition have vanished, and the fires of passion have been quenched, and for all eternity the young soul is in the presence of its God. Let none of you think that his life has been wasted. Possibly, had it pleased heaven to spare him, he might have found great works to do among his fellow-men, and he would have done them as few else could. But do not let us fancy that our work must cease of necessity with our lives. Not so; far rather must we believe that it will continue for ever; seeing that we are all partakers of God's unspeakable blessing, the common mystery of immortality. Perhaps it may be the glorious destiny of very many here to recognise that truth, more fully when we meet and converse with our dear departed brother in a holier and happier world.""",speak say congregation mourner few week sit mourn death many time mourn past day mark go astray mourn fiery trial die penitent happy last sorrow dream ambition vanish fire passion quench eternity young soul presence let think life waste pleased heaven spare find great work do fellow man do few let fancy work cease necessity life believe continue see partaker unspeakable blessing common mystery immortality glorious destiny many recognise truth meet converse dear depart brother holy happy world

32,"The suggestion took me by surprise, but I thought over it, and at once began to accomplish it. My own reminiscences of Eric were numerous and vivid, and several of my old schoolfellows and friends gladly supplied me with other particulars, especially the Bishop of Roslyn, Mr. Rose, Montagu, and Wildney. So the story of Eric's ruin has been told, and told as he would have wished it done, with simple truth. Noble Eric! I do not fear that I have wronged your memory, and you I know would rejoice to think how sorrowful hours have lost something of their sorrow, as I wrote the scenes in so many of which we were engaged together in our school-boy days.",suggestion take surprise think begin accomplish own reminiscence numerous vivid several old schoolfellow friend supply other particular story ruin tell tell wish do simple truth noble fear wrong memory know rejoice think sorrowful hour lose sorrow write scene many engage school boy day 
33,"I visited Roslyn a short time ago, and walked for hours along the sands, picturing in my memory the pleasant faces, and recalling the joyous tones of the many whom I had known and loved. Other boys were playing by the sea-side, who were strangers to me and I to them; and as I marked how wave after wave rolled up the shore, with its murmur and its foam, each sweeping farther than the other, each effacing the traces of the last, I saw an emblem of the passing generations, and was content to find that my place knew me no more.",visit short time walk hour sand picture memory pleasant face recall joyous tone many know love other boy play sea side stranger mark wave wave roll shore murmur foam sweep far other efface trace last see emblem pass generation content find place know more

35,"And the sea still laughs to the rosy shells ashore,        And the shore still shines in the lustre of the wave;      But the joyaunce and the beauty of the boyish days is o'er,        And many of the beautiful lie quiet in the grave;--          And he who comes again          Wears a brow of toil and pain,      And wanders sad and silent by the melancholy main.
