6,"Laura understood without being told. She, too, had thought Guy and Amy were a great deal together, and combining various observations, she perceived that her mother must have given Amy a caution. She therefore set herself, like a good sister, to shelter Amy as much as she could, save her from awkward situations, and, above all, to prevent her altered manner from being remarked. This was the less difficult, as Eveleen was subdued and languid, and more inclined to lie on the sofa and read than to look out for mirth.",understand tell think great deal combine various observation perceive mother give caution set good sister shelter much save awkward situation prevent alter manner remark difficult subdued languid inclined lie sofa read look mirth 
7,"As to poor little Amy, her task was in one way become less hard, for Guy had ceased to haunt her, and seemed to make it his business to avoid all that could cause her embarrassment; but in another way it hurt her much more, for she now saw the pain she was causing. If obliged to do anything for her, he would give a look as if to ask pardon, and then her rebellious heart would so throb with joy as to cause her dismay at having let herself fall into so hateful a habit as wishing to attract attention. What a struggle it was not to obey the impulse of turning to him for the smile with which he would greet anything in conversation that interested them both, and how wrong she thought it not to be more consoled when she saw him talking to Eveleen, or to any of the others, as if he was doing very well without her. This did not often happen; he was evidently out of spirits, and thoughtful, and Amy was afraid some storm might be gathering respecting Mr. Sebastian Dixon, about whom there always seemed to be some uncomfortable mystery.",poor little task way become hard cease haunt seem make business avoid cause embarrassment way hurt more see pain cause oblige do give look ask pardon rebellious heart throb joy cause dismay let fall hateful habit wish attract attention struggle obey impulse turn smile greet conversation interest wrong think console see talk other do happen spirit thoughtful afraid storm gather respect seem uncomfortable mystery 
8,"Mrs. Edmonstone saw everything, and said nothing. She was very sorry for them both, but she could not interfere, and could only hope she had done right, and protected Amy as far as she was able. She was vexed now and then to see Eveleen give knowing smiles and significant glances, feared that she guessed what was going on, and wondered whether to give her a hint not to add to Amy’s confusion; but her great dislike to enter on such a subject prevailed, and she left things to take their course, thinking that, for once, Guy’s departure would be a relief.",see say sorry interfere hope do right protect able vex see give know smile significant glance fear guess go wonder give hint add confusion great dislike enter subject prevail leave thing take course think departure relief 
9,"The approach of anything in the shape of a party of pleasure was one of the best cures for Eveleen’s ailments, and the evening before Mary’s tea-drinking, she was in high spirits, laughing and talking a great deal, and addressing herself chiefly to Guy. He exerted himself to answer, but it did not come with life and spirit, his countenance did not light up, and at last Eveleen said, ‘Ah! I see I am a dreadful bore. I’ll go away, and leave you to repose.’",approach shape party pleasure good cure ailment evening tea drinking high spirit laugh talk great deal address exert answer come life spirit countenance light last say see dreadful bore go leave repose

12,"‘No, no,’ he answered, colouring crimson, and then trying to laugh off his confusion, and find some answer, but without success; and Eveleen, perceiving her aunt’s eyes were upon her, suddenly recollected that she had gone quite as far as decorum allowed, and made as masterly a retreat as the circumstances permitted.",answer colour crimson try laugh confusion find answer success perceive aunt eye recollect go decorum allow make retreat circumstance permit

14,"This scene made Mrs. Edmonstone doubly annoyed, the next morning, at waking with a disabling headache, which made it quite impossible for her to attempt going to Mary Ross’s fete. With great sincerity, Amy entreated to be allowed to remain at home, but she thought it would only be making the change more remarkable; she did not wish Mary to be disappointed; among so many ladies, Amy could easily avoid getting into difficulties; while Laura would, she trusted, be able to keep Eveleen in order.",scene make annoy next morning wake disabl headache make impossible attempt go fete great sincerity entreat allow remain home think make change remarkable wish disappoint many lady avoid get difficulty trust able keep order 
15,"The day was sunny, and all went off to admiration. The gentlemen presided over the cricket, and the ladies over ‘blind man’s buff’ and ‘thread my needle;’ but perhaps Mary was a little disappointed that, though she had Sir Guy’s bodily presence, the peculiar blitheness and animation which he usually shed around him were missing. He sung at church, he filled tiny cups from huge pitchers of tea, he picked up and pacified a screaming child that had tumbled off a gate--he was as good-natured and useful as possible, but he was not his joyous and brilliant self.",day sunny go admiration gentleman preside cricket lady blind man buff thread needle little disappointed have bodily presence peculiar blitheness animation shed miss sung church fill tiny cup huge pitcher tea pick pacify scream child tumble gate good natured useful possible joyous brilliant self 
16,"Amy devoted herself to the smallest fry, played assiduously for three quarters of an hour with a fat, grave boy of three, who stood about a yard-and-a-half from her, solemnly throwing a ball into her lap, and never catching it again, took charge of many caps and bonnets, and walked about with Louisa Harper, a companion whom no one envied her.",devote small fry play quarter hour fat grave boy stand yard half throw ball lap catching take charge many cap bonnet walk companion envie 
17,"In conclusion, the sky clouded over, it became chilly, and a shower began to fall. Laura pursued Eveleen, and Amy hunted up Charlotte from the utmost parts of the field, where she was the very centre of ‘winding up the clock,’ and sorely against her will, dragged her off the wet grass. About sixty yards from the house, Guy met them with an umbrella, which, without speaking, he gave to Charlotte. Amy said, ‘Thank you,’ and again came that look. Charlotte rattled on, and hung back to talk to Guy, so that Amy could not hasten on without leaving her shelterless. It may be believed that she had the conversation to herself. At the door they met Mary and her father, going to dismiss their flock, who had taken refuge in a cart-shed at the other end of the field. Guy asked if he could be of any use; Mr. Ross said no, and Mary begged Amy and Charlotte to go up to her room, and change their wet shoes.",conclusion sky cloude become chilly shower begin fall pursue hunt utmost part field very centre wind clock will drag wet grass yard house guy meet umbrella speak give say thank come look rattle hang talk hast leave shelterless believe have conversation door meet father go dismiss flock take refuge cart shed other end field guy ask use say begg go room change wet shoe 
18,"There, Amy would fain have stayed, flushed and agitated as those looks made her; but Charlotte was in wild spirits, delighted at having been caught in the rain, and obliged to wear shoes a mile too large, and eager to go and share the fun in the drawing-room. There, in the twilight, they found a mass of young ladies herded together, making a confused sound of laughter, and giggling, while at the other end of the room, Amy could just see Guy sitting alone in a dark corner.",stay flush agitate look make wild spirit delight catch rain oblige wear shoe mile large eager go share fun draw room twilight find mass young lady herd make confuse sound laughter giggle other end room see guy sit dark corner

32,"‘Ay! tell him so,’ cried Ellen, and they laughed in a manner that overpowered Amy with horror and shyness. She sprung to seize Charlotte, and stop her; she could not speak, but Louisa Harper caught her arm, and Laura’s grave orders were drowned in a universal titter, and suppressed exclamation,--‘Go, Charlotte, go; we will never forgive you if you don’t!’",tell cry laugh manner overpower horror shyness spring seize stop speak catch arm grave order drown universal titter suppress exclamation go go forgive 
33,"‘Stop!’ Amy struggled to cry, breaking from Louisa, and springing up in a sort of agony. Guy, who had such a horror of singing anything deep in pathos or religious feeling to mixed or unfit auditors, asked to do so in her name! ‘Stop! oh, Charlotte!’ It was too late; Charlotte, thoughtless with merriment, amused at vexing Laura, set up with applause, and confident in Guy’s good nature, had come to him, and was saying,--‘Oh, Guy!

34,"Amy saw him start up. What, did he think of her? Oh, what! He stepped towards them. The silly girls cowered as if they had roused a lion. His voice was not loud--it was almost as gentle as usual; but it quivered, as if it was hard to keep it so, and, as well as she could see, his face was rigid and stern as iron. ‘Did you wish it?’ he said, addressing himself to her, as if she was the only person present.",see start think step silly girl cower rouse lion voice loud gentle usual quiver hard keep see face rigid stern iron wish say address only person present 
35,"Her breath was almost gone. ‘Oh! I beg your pardon,’ she faltered. She could not exculpate herself, she saw it looked like an idle, almost like an indecorous trick, unkind, everything abhorrent to her and to him, especially in the present state of things. His eyes were on her, his head bent towards her; he waited for an answer. ‘I beg your pardon,’ was all she could say.",breath gone beg pardon falter exculpate see look idle indecorous trick unkind abhorrent present state thing eye head bend wait answer beg pardon say 
36,"There was--yes, there was--one of those fearful flashes of his kindling eye. She felt as if she was shrinking to nothing; she heard him say, in a low, hoarse tone, ‘I am afraid I cannot;’ then Mr. Ross, Mary, lights came in; there was a bustle and confusion, and when next she was clearly conscious, Laura was ordering the carriage.",be be fearful flash kindling eye feel shrink hear say low hoarse tone afraid light come be bustle confusion next conscious order carriage

40,"The ladies entered the carriage. Amy leant back in her corner, Laura forbore to scold either Eveleen or Charlotte till she could have them separately; Eveleen was silent, because she was dismayed at the effect she had produced, and Charlotte, because she knew there was a scolding impending over her.",lady enter carriage lean corner forbore scold have silent dismay effect produce know be scolding impending 
41,"They found no one in the drawing-room but Mr. Edmonstone and Charles, who said they had heard the door open, and Guy run up-stairs, but they supposed he was wet through, as he had not made his appearance. It was very inhospitable in the girls not to have made room for him in the carriage.",find draw room say hear door open guy run stair suppose wet make appearance inhospitable girl make room carriage 
42,"Amy went to see how her mother was, longing to tell her whole trouble, but found her asleep, and was obliged to leave it till the morrow. Poor child, she slept very little, but she would not go to her mother before breakfast, lest she should provoke the headache into staying another day. Guy was going by the train at twelve o’clock, and she was resolved that something should be done; so, as soon as her father had wished Guy goodbye, and ridden off to his justice meeting, she entreated her mother to come into the dressing-room, and hear what she had to say.",go see mother long tell whole trouble find asleep oblige leave morrow poor child sleep little go mother breakfast provoke headache stay day guy go train o'clock resolve do father wish guy goodbye ride justice meeting entreat mother come dress room hear have say

49,"A message came for Mrs. Edmonstone, and while she was attending to it, Amy hastened away, fully believing that her mother had authorized her to go and explain it to Guy, and ask his pardon. It was what she thought the natural thing to do, and she was soon by his side, as she saw him pacing, with folded arms, under the wall.",message come attend hasten believe mother authorize go explain ask pardon think natural thing do side see pace fold arm wall 
50,"Much had lately been passing in Guy’s mind. He had gone on floating on the sunny stream of life at Hollywell, too happy to observe its especial charm till the change in Amy’s manner cast a sudden gloom over all. Not till then did he understand his own feelings, and recognize in her the being he had dreamt of. Amy was what made Hollywell precious to him. Sternly as he was wont to treat his impulses, he did not look on his affection as an earthborn fancy, liable to draw him from higher things, and, therefore, to be combated; he deemed her rather a guide and guard whose love might arm him, soothe him, and encourage him. Yet he had little hope, for he did not do justice to his powers of inspiring affection; no one could distrust his temper and his character as much as he did himself, and with his ancestry and the doom he believed attached to his race, with his own youth and untried principles, with his undesirable connections, and the reserve he was obliged to exercise regarding them, he considered himself as objectionable a person as could well be found, as yet untouched by any positive crime, and he respected the Edmonstones too much to suppose that these disadvantages could be counterbalanced for a moment by his position; indeed, he interpreted Amy’s coolness by supposing that there was a desire to discourage his attentions. No poor tutor or penniless cousin ever felt he was doing a more desperate thing in confessing an attachment, than did Sir Guy Morville when he determined that all should be told, at the risk of losing her for ever, and closing against himself the doors of his happy home. It was not right and fair by her parents, he thought, so to regard their daughter, and live in the same house with his sentiments unavowed, and as to Amy herself, if his feelings had reached such a pitch of sensitiveness that he must needs behave like an angry lion, because her name had been dragged into an idle joke, it was high time it should be explained, unpropitious as the moment might be for declaring his attachment, when he had manifested such a temper as any woman might dread. Thus he made up his mind that, come of it what might, he would not leave Hollywell that day till the truth was told. Just as he was turning to find Mrs. Edmonstone and ‘put his fate to the touch,’ a little figure stood beside him, and Amy’s own sweet, low tones were saying, imploringly,--",much pass mind go float sunny stream life happy observe especial charm change manner cast sudden gloom understand own feeling recognize being dreamt make precious wont treat impulse look affection earthborn fancy liable draw high thing combate deem guide guard love arm soothe encourage have little hope do justice power inspire affection distrust temper character much do ancestry doom believe attach race own youth untried principle undesirable connection reserve oblige exercise regard consider objectionable person find untouched positive crime respect much suppose disadvantage counterbalance moment position interpret coolness suppose be desire discourage attention poor tutor penniless cousin feel do desperate thing confess attachment do determine tell risk lose close door happy home right fair parent think regard daughter live same house sentiment unavowed feeling reach pitch sensitiveness need behave angry lion name drag idle joke high time explain unpropitious moment declare attachment manifest temper woman dread make mind come leave day truth tell turn find put fate touch little figure stand own sweet low tone say

55,"Was this what ‘mamma’ objected to? Oh no! Amy felt she must stay now, and, in truth, she was glad it was right, though her heart beat fast, fast, faster, as Guy, pulling down a long, trailing branch of Noisette rose, and twisting it in his hand, paused for a few moments, then spoke collectedly, and without hesitation, though with the tremulousness of subdued agitation, looking the while not at her, but straight before him.",mamma’ object feel stay truth glad right heart beat fast fast fast guy pull long trail branch rise twist hand pause few moment speak hesitation tremulousness subdued agitation look while

57,"The flame rushed into Amy’s cheeks, and no one could have told what she felt, as he paused again, and then went on speaking more quickly, as if his emotion was less under control.",flame rush cheek tell feel pause go speak emotion less control 
58,"‘If ever there is to be happiness for me on earth, it must be through you; as you, for the last three years, have been all my brightness here.

59,"Amy’s impulse was that anything shared with him would be welcome; but the strength of the feeling stifled the power of expression, and she could not utter a word.",impulse share welcome strength feeling stifle power expression utter word 
60,"‘It seems selfish even to dream of it,’ he proceeded, ‘yet I must,--I cannot help it. To feel that I had your love to keep me safe, to know that you watched for me, prayed for me, were my own, my Verena,--oh Amy! it would be more joy than I have ever dared to hope for. But mind,’ he added, after another brief pause, ‘I would not even ask you to answer me now, far less to bind yourself, even if--if it were possible. I know my trial is not come; and were I to render myself, by positive act, unworthy even to think of you, it would be too dreadful to have entangled you, and made you unhappy.

61,"At that moment, close on the other side of the box-tree clump, were heard the wheels of Charles’s garden-chair, and Charlotte’s voice talking to him, as he made his morning tour round the garden. Amy flew off, like a little bird to its nest, and never stopped till, breathless and crimson, she darted into the dressing room, threw herself on her knees, and with her face hidden in her mother’s lap, exclaimed in panting, half-smothered, whispers, which needed all Mrs. Edmonstone’s intuition to make them intelligible,--",moment close other side box tree clump hear wheel garden chair voice talk make morning tour garden fly little bird nest stop breathless crimson dart dress room throw knee face hide mother lap exclaim panting half smother whisper need intuition make intelligible

63,"Perhaps Mrs. Edmonstone was not so very much surprised; but she had no time to do more than raise and kiss the burning face, and see, at a moment’s glance, how bright was the gleam of frightened joy, in the downcast eye and troubled smile; when two knocks, given rapidly, were heard, and almost at the same moment the door opened, and Guy stood before her, his face no less glowing than that which Amy buried again on her mother’s knee.",surprised have time do more raise kiss burning face see moment glance bright gleam frighten joy downcast eye troubled smile knock give hear same moment door open stand face glow bury mother knee

67,"‘You know what I am come to say,’ he began, standing by the mantel-shelf, as was his wont in his conferences with Mrs. Edmonstone; and he repeated the same in substance as he had said to Amy in the garden, though with less calmness and coherence, and far more warmth of expression, as if, now that she was protected by her mother’s presence, he exercised less force in self-restraint.",know come say begin stand mantel shelf conference repeat same substance say garden less calmness coherence more warmth expression protect mother presence exercise less force self restraint 
68,"Never was anyone happier than was Mrs. Edmonstone; loving Guy so heartily, seeing the beauty of his character in each word, rejoicing that such affection should be bestowed on her little Amy, exulting in her having won such a heart, and touched and gratified by the free confidence with which both had at once hastened to pour out all to her, not merely as a duty, but in the full ebullition of their warm young love. The only difficulty was to bring herself to speak with prudence becoming her position, whilst she was sympathizing with them as ardently as if she was not older than both of them put together. When Guy spoke of himself as unproved, and undeserving of trust, it was all she could do to keep from declaring there was no one whom she thought so safe.",happy love guy see beauty character word rejoice such affection bestow little exult win heart touch gratified free confidence hasten pour duty full ebullition warm young love only difficulty bring speak prudence become position sympathize old put speak unproved undeserving trust do keep declare be think safe

78,"To all three that space was as bright a gleam of sunshine as ever embellished life, so short as to be free from a single care, a perfectly serenely happy present, the more joyous from having been preceded by vexations, each of the two young things learning that there was love where it was most precious. Guy especially, isolated and lonely as he stood in life, with his fear and mistrust of himself, was now not only allowed to love, and assured beyond his hopes that Amy returned his affection, but found himself thus welcomed by the mother, and gathered into the family where his warm feelings had taken up their abode, while he believed himself regarded only as a guest and a stranger.",space bright gleam sunshine embellish life short free single care happy present joyous precede vexation young thing learn be love precious guy isolated lonely stand life fear mistrust allow love assure hope return affection find welcome mother gather family warm feeling take abode believe regard guest stranger

They started up, Guy threw down his roses, caught Amy’s hand and pressed it, while she bent down her head, hiding the renewed blush; he dashed out of the room, and up to his own, while Mrs. Edmonstone and Charlotte hurried down.
