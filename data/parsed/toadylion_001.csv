1,"CHAPTER I. PRISSY, HUGH JOHN, AND SIR TOADY LION.",prissy 
2," It is always difficult to be great, but it is specially difficult when greatness is thrust upon one, as it were, along with the additional burden of a distinguished historical name. This was the case with General Napoleon Smith. Yet when this story opens he was not a general. That came later, along with the cares of empire and the management of great campaigns.",difficult great difficult greatness thrust additional burden distinguished historical name case story open general come care empire management great campaign 
3,"But already in secret he was Napoleon Smith, though his nurse sometimes still referred to him as Johnnie, and his father--but stay. I will reveal to you the secret of our soldier's life right at the start. Though a Napoleon, our hero was no Buonaparte. No, his name was Smith--plain Smith; his father was the owner of four large farms and a good many smaller ones, near that celebrated Border which separates the two hostile countries of England and Scotland. Neighbours referred to the General's father easily as ""Picton Smith of Windy Standard,"" from the soughing, mist-nursing mountain of heather and fir-trees which gave its name to the estate, and to the large farm he had cultivated himself ever since the death of his wife, chiefly as a means of distracting his mind, and keeping at a distance loneliness and sad thoughts.",secret nurse refer father stay reveal secret soldier life start hero name plain father owner large farm good many small one celebrate border separate hostile country neighbour refer father windy soughing mist nursing mountain heather fir tree give name estate large farm cultivate death wife means distract mind keep distance loneliness sad thought 
4,"Hugh John Smith had never mentioned the fact of his Imperial descent to his father, but in a moment of confidence he had told his old nurse, who smiled with a world-weary wisdom, which betrayed her knowledge of the secrets of courts--and said that doubtless it was so. He had also a brother and sister, but they were not, at that time, of the race of the Corporal of Ajaccio. On the contrary, Arthur George, the younger, aged five, was an engine-driver. There was yet another who rode in a mail-cart, and puckered up his face upon being addressed in a strange foreign language, as ""Was-it-then? A darling--goo-goo--then it was!"" This creature, however, was not owned as a brother by Hugh John and Arthur George, and indeed may at this point be dismissed from the story. The former went so far as stoutly to deny his brother's sex, in the face of such proofs as were daily afforded by Baby's tendency to slap his sister's face wherever they met, and also to seize things and throw them on the floor for the pleasure of seeing them break. Arthur George, however, had secret hopes that Baby would even yet turn out a satisfactory boy whenever he saw him killing flies on the window, and on these occasions hounded him on to yet deadlier exertions. But he dared not mention his anticipations to his soldier brother, that haughty scion of an Imperial race. For reasons afterwards to be given, Arthur George was usually known as Toady Lion.",mention fact imperial descent father moment confidence tell old nurse smile world weary wisdom betray knowledge secret court say have brother sister time race contrary young aged engine driver be ride mail cart pucker face address strange foreign language darling creature own brother point dismiss story former go deny brother sex face such proof afford tendency slap sister face meet seize thing throw floor pleasure see break have secret hope turn satisfactory boy see kill fly window occasion hound deadly exertion mention anticipation soldier brother haughty scion imperial race reason give know 
5,"Then Hugh John had a sister. Her name was Priscilla. Priscilla was distinguished also, though not in a military sense. She was literary, and wrote books ""on the sly,"" as Hugh John said. He considered this secrecy the only respectable part of a very shady business. Specially he objected to being made to serve as the hero of Priscilla's tales, and went so far as to promise to ""thump"" his sister if he caught her introducing him as of any military rank under that of either general or colour-sergeant.",have sister name distinguish military sense literary write book sly say consider secrecy only respectable part shady business object make serve hero tale go promise thump sister catch introduce military rank general colour sergeant

11,"It is sad to be obliged to state here, in the very beginning of these veracious chronicles, that at this time Prissy and Napoleon Smith were by no means model children, though Prissy afterwards marvellously improved. Even their best friends admitted as much, and as for their enemies--well, their old gardener's remarks when they chased each other over his newly planted beds would be out of place even in a military periodical, and might be the means of preventing a book with Mr. Gordon Browne's nice pictures from being included in some well-conducted Sunday-school libraries.",sad oblige state very beginning veracious chronicle time means model child improve good friend admit much enemy old gardener remark chase other plant bed place military periodical means prevent book nice picture include conduct school library 
12,"General Napoleon Smith could not catch Priscilla (as, indeed, he well knew before he started), especially when she picked up her skirts and went right at hedges and ditches like a young colt. Napoleon looked upon this trait in Prissy's character as degrading and unsportsmanlike in the extreme. He regarded long skirts, streaming hair, and flapping, aggravating pinafores as the natural handicap of girls in the race of life, and as particularly useful when they ""cheeked"" their brothers. It was therefore wicked to neutralise these equalising disadvantages by strings tied round above the knees, or by the still more scientific device of a sash suspended from the belt before, passed between Prissy's legs, and attached to the belt behind.",catch know start pick skirt go hedge ditch young colt look trait character degrading unsportsmanlike extreme regard long skirt stream hair flap aggravate pinafore natural handicap girl race life useful cheek brother wicked neutralise equalise disadvantage string tie knee scientific device sash suspend belt pass leg attach belt 
13,"But, then, as Napoleon admitted even at ten years of age, girls are capable of anything; and to his dying day he has never had any reason to change his opinion--at least, so far as he has yet got.",admit year age girl capable die day have reason change opinion least get

16,"It was thus that Priscilla, to whom in after times great lights of criticism listened with approval, was compelled to stoop to artifice and bribery in order to secure and hold her first audience. Whereupon the authoress took paper from her pocket, and as she did so, held the manuscript with its back to Napoleon Smith, in order to conceal the suspicious shortness of the lines. But that great soldier instantly detected the subterfuge.",time great light criticism listen approval compel stake artifice bribery order secure hold first audience authoress take paper pocket hold manuscript back order conceal suspicious shortness line great soldier detect subterfuge

22,"""That's not quite so bad as usual,"" said Napoleon condescendingly, toying meanwhile with the lash of an old dog-whip he had just ""boned"" out of the harness-room. Priscilla beamed gratefully upon her critic, and proceeded--",bad usual say toy lash old dog whip bon harness room beam critic proceed

47,"""_I_ don't care for father--"" the prone but gallant General was proceeding to declare in the face of Priscilla's horrified protestations that he mustn't speak so, when a slow heavy step was heard on the other side of the hedge, and a deep voice uttered the single syllable, ""_John!_""",care father prone gallant proceed declare face horrify protestation speak slow heavy step hear other side hedge deep voice utter single syllable
