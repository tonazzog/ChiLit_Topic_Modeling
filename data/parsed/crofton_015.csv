2,"The longer these two boys were together, the more they wished they could spend their lives side by side; or, at least, not be separated by half the globe.  Just before the Christmas holidays, some news arrived which startled them so much that they could hardly speak to one another about it for some hours.  There was a deep feeling in their hearts which disposed them to speak alone to the Ruler of their lives, before they could even rejoice with one another.  When they meditated upon it, they saw that the event had come about naturally enough; but it so exactly met the strongest desire they had in the world, that if a miracle had happened before their eyes, they could not have been more struck.",boy more wish spend life side side least separate globe holiday news arrive startle speak hour be deep feeling heart dispose speak life rejoice meditate see event come meet strong desire have world miracle happen eye strike 
3,"Holt's father wrote a letter to Mr Proctor, which reached its destination through Mr Tooke's hands; and Mr Tooke was consulted in the whole matter, and requested by Mr Proctor to tell the two boys and Phil all about it.  These three were therefore called into Mr Tooke's study one day, to hear some news.",father write letter reach destination hand consult whole matter request tell boy call study day hear news 
4,"The letters which Mr Tooke read were about Hugh.  Mr Holt explained that his son's best years were to be spent, like his own, in India; that his own experience had made him extremely anxious that his son should be associated with companions whom he could respect and love; and that he had long resolved to use such interest as he had in bringing out only such a youth, or youths, as he could wish his son to associate with.  He mentioned that he was aware that one lad now at Crofton was destined for India--",letter read explain son good year spend own own experience make anxious son associate companion respect love resolve use such interest have bring youth youth wish son associate mention aware lad destine

6,"But that he did not hear of any friendship formed, or likely to be formed with advantage between his son and this young gentleman.",hear friendship form likely form advantage son young gentleman 
7,"""No, indeed!"" muttered Holt.",mutter 
8,"There was one boy, however, Mr Holt went on to say, to whom his son seemed to be attached, and concerning whom he had related circumstances which inspired a strong interest, and which seemed to afford an expectation of an upright manhood following a gallant youth.",be boy go say son seem attach concern have related circumstance inspire strong interest seem afford expectation upright manhood follow gallant youth 
9,"Here all the boys reddened, and Hugh looked hard at the carpet.",boy redden look carpet 
10,"This boy had evidently a strong inclination for travel and adventure; and though his lameness put military or naval service out of the question, it might not unfit him for civil service in India.  If Mr Tooke could give such a report of his health, industry, and capability as should warrant his being offered an appointment, and if his parents were willing so to dispose of him, Mr Holt was anxious to make arrangements for the education of the boys proceeding together, in order to their being companions in their voyage and subsequent employments. And then followed some account of what these arrangements were to be.",boy have strong inclination travel adventure lameness put military naval service question unfit civil service give report health industry capability warrant offer appointment parent willing dispose anxious make arrangement education boy proceed order companion voyage subsequent employment follow account arrangement 
11,"""Now, Proctor,"" said Mr Tooke to the breathless Hugh, ""you must consider what you have to say to this.  Your parents are willing to agree if you are.  But if,"" he continued, with a kind smile, ""it would make you very unhappy to go to India, no one will force your inclinations.""",say breathless consider have say parent willing agree continue kind smile make unhappy go force inclination 
12,"""Oh, sir,"" said Hugh, ""I will work very hard,--I will work as hard as ever I can, if I may go.""",sir say work work go 
13,"""Well: you may go, you see, if you will work hard.  You can consider it quietly, or talk it over with your brother and Holt; and to-morrow you are to dine at your uncle's, where you will meet your father; and he and you will settle what to write to Mr Holt, by the next ship.""",go see work consider talk brother dine uncle meet father settle write next ship 
14,"""And you, sir,"" said Phil, anxiously--""Mr Holt asks your opinion.""",sir say ask opinion 
15,"""My opinion is that your brother can be what he pleases.  He wants some inducement to pursue his learning more strenuously than he has done yet--""",opinion brother please want inducement pursue learning do 
16,"""I will, sir.  I will,"" indeed, cried Hugh.",sir cry 
17,"""I believe you will.  Such a prospect as this will be an inducement, if anything can.  You are, on the whole, a brave boy; and brave boys are not apt to be ungrateful to God or man; and I am sure you think it would be ungrateful, both to God and man, to refuse to do your best in the situation which gratifies the first wish of your heart.""",believe prospect inducement whole brave boy brave boy apt ungrateful man sure think ungrateful man refuse do good situation gratify first wish heart 
18,"Hugh could not say another word.  He made his lowest bow, and went straight to his desk.  As the first fruits of his gratitude, he learned his lessons thoroughly well that night; much as he would have liked to spend the time in dreaming.",say word make low bow go desk first fruit gratitude learn lesson night much like spend time dreaming 
19,"His father and he had no difficulty in settling what to write to Mr Holt; and very merry were they together when the business was done.  In a day or two, when Hugh had had time to think, he began to be glad on Tooke's account; and he found an opportunity of saying to him one day,--",father have difficulty settle write merry business do day have time think begin glad account find opportunity say day 
20,"""I never should have gone to India if I had not lost my foot; and I think it is well worth while losing my foot to go to India.""",go lose foot think worth lose foot go 
21,"""Do you really?  Or do you say it because--""",say 
22,"""I think so really.""  And then he went off into such a description as convinced Tooke that he was in earnest, though it was to be feared that he would be disappointed by experience.  But then again, Mr Tooke was heard to say that one chief requisite for success and enjoyment in foreign service of any kind was a strong inclination for it.  So Tooke was consoled, and easier in mind than for a whole year past.",think go description convince take earnest fear disappoint experience hear say chief requisite success enjoyment foreign service kind strong inclination console easy mind whole year past 
23,"Hugh was able to keep his promise of working hard.  Both at Crofton and at the India College, where his education was finished, he studied well and successfully; and when he set sail with his companion, it was with a heart free from all cares but one.  Parting from his family was certainly a great grief; and he could not forget the last tone he had heard from Agnes.  But this was his only sorrow.  He was, at last, on the wide sea, and going to Asia.  Holt was his dear friend.  He had left none but well-wishers behind.  His secret was his own; (though, indeed, he scarcely remembered that he had any secret;) and he could not but be conscious that he went out well prepared for honourable duty.",able keep promise work education finish study set sail companion heart free care part family great grief forget last tone hear only sorrow last wide sea go dear friend leave wisher secret own remember have secret conscious go prepare honourable duty
