2,"Presently there came a great rattling of chains and bolts, and the door was cautiously opened and shut to again behind me as soon as I had passed.",come great rattling chain bolt door open shut pass 
3,"“Go into the kitchen and touch naething,” said the voice; and while the person of the house set himself to replacing the defences of the door, I groped my way forward and entered the kitchen.",go kitchen touch naething say voice person house set replace defence door grope way enter kitchen 
4,"The fire had burned up fairly bright, and showed me the barest room I think I ever put my eyes on. Half-a-dozen dishes stood upon the shelves; the table was laid for supper with a bowl of porridge, a horn spoon, and a cup of small beer. Besides what I have named, there was not another thing in that great, stone-vaulted, empty chamber but lockfast chests arranged along the wall and a corner cupboard with a padlock.",fire burn bright show barest room think put eye half dish stand shelf table lay supper bowl porridge horn spoon cup small beer name be thing great stone vault empty chamber lockfast chest arrange wall corner cupboard padlock 
5,"As soon as the last chain was up, the man rejoined me. He was a mean, stooping, narrow-shouldered, clay-faced creature; and his age might have been anything between fifty and seventy. His nightcap was of flannel, and so was the nightgown that he wore, instead of coat and waistcoat, over his ragged shirt. He was long unshaved; but what most distressed and even daunted me, he would neither take his eyes away from me nor look me fairly in the face. What he was, whether by trade or birth, was more than I could fathom; but he seemed most like an old, unprofitable serving-man, who should have been left in charge of that big house upon board wages.",last chain man rejoin mean stoop narrow shoulder clay face creature age nightcap flannel nightgown wear coat waistcoat ragged shirt long unshaved distress daunt take eye look face trade birth more fathom seem most old unprofitable serving man leave charge big house board wage 
6,"“Are ye sharp-set?” he asked, glancing at about the level of my knee. “Ye can eat that drop parritch?”",sharp set ask glance level knee eat drop parritch

8,"“O,” said he, “I can do fine wanting it. I’ll take the ale, though, for it slockens (moistens) my cough.” He drank the cup about half out, still keeping an eye upon me as he drank; and then suddenly held out his hand. “Let’s see the letter,” said he.",say do fine want take ale slocken moisten cough drink cup half keep eye drink hold hand let see letter say 
9,I told him the letter was for Mr. Balfour; not for him.,tell letter 
10,“And who do ye think I am?” says he. “Give me Alexander’s letter.”,think say give letter 
11,“You know my father’s name?”,know father name 
12,"“It would be strange if I didnae,” he returned, “for he was my born brother; and little as ye seem to like either me or my house, or my good parritch, I’m your born uncle, Davie, my man, and you my born nephew. So give us the letter, and sit down and fill your kyte.”",strange didnae return bear brother little seem like house good parritch bear uncle man bear nephew give letter sit fill kyte 
13,"If I had been some years younger, what with shame, weariness, and disappointment, I believe I had burst into tears. As it was, I could find no words, neither black nor white, but handed him the letter, and sat down to the porridge with as little appetite for meat as ever a young man had.",year young shame weariness disappointment believe burst tear find word black white hand letter sit porridge little appetite meat young man have 
14,"Meanwhile, my uncle, stooping over the fire, turned the letter over and over in his hands.",uncle stoop fire turn letter hand 
15,"“Do ye ken what’s in it?” he asked, suddenly.",ke ask 
16,"“You see for yourself, sir,” said I, “that the seal has not been broken.”",see sir say seal break 
17,"“Ay,” said he, “but what brought you here?”",say bring

19,"“No,” says he, cunningly, “but ye’ll have had some hopes, nae doubt?”",say have hope doubt 
20,"“I confess, sir,” said I, “when I was told that I had kinsfolk well-to-do, I did indeed indulge the hope that they might help me in my life. But I am no beggar; I look for no favours at your hands, and I want none that are not freely given. For as poor as I appear, I have friends of my own that will be blithe to help me.”",confess sir say tell kinsfolk do indulge hope help life beggar look favour hand want give poor appear have friend own blithe help 
21,"“Hoot-toot!” said Uncle Ebenezer, “dinnae fly up in the snuff at me. We’ll agree fine yet. And, Davie, my man, if you’re done with that bit parritch, I could just take a sup of it myself. Ay,” he continued, as soon as he had ousted me from the stool and spoon, “they’re fine, halesome food--they’re grand food, parritch.” He murmured a little grace to himself and fell to. “Your father was very fond of his meat, I mind; he was a hearty, if not a great eater; but as for me, I could never do mair than pyke at food.” He took a pull at the small beer, which probably reminded him of hospitable duties, for his next speech ran thus: “If ye’re dry ye’ll find water behind the door.”",hoot toot say fly snuff agree fine man done bit parritch take sup continue oust stool spoon fine halesome food grand food parritch murmure little grace fall father fond meat mind hearty great eater do mair food take pull small beer remind hospitable duty next speech run dry find water door 
22,"To this I returned no answer, standing stiffly on my two feet, and looking down upon my uncle with a mighty angry heart. He, on his part, continued to eat like a man under some pressure of time, and to throw out little darting glances now at my shoes and now at my home-spun stockings. Once only, when he had ventured to look a little higher, our eyes met; and no thief taken with a hand in a man’s pocket could have shown more lively signals of distress. This set me in a muse, whether his timidity arose from too long a disuse of any human company; and whether perhaps, upon a little trial, it might pass off, and my uncle change into an altogether different man. From this I was awakened by his sharp voice.",return answer stand foot look uncle mighty angry heart part continue eat man pressure time throw little dart glance shoe home spun stocking venture look little high eye meet thief take hand man pocket show more lively signal distress set muse timidity arise long disuse human company little trial pass uncle change different man awaken sharp voice

26,"“I never knew, sir, till you told it me yourself, that he had any brother.”",know sir tell have brother 
27,"“Dear me, dear me!” said Ebenezer. “Nor yet of Shaws, I dare say?”",dear say say 
28,"“Not so much as the name, sir,” said I.",much name sir say 
29,"“To think o’ that!” said he. “A strange nature of a man!” For all that, he seemed singularly satisfied, but whether with himself, or me, or with this conduct of my father’s, was more than I could read. Certainly, however, he seemed to be outgrowing that distaste, or ill-will, that he had conceived at first against my person; for presently he jumped up, came across the room behind me, and hit me a smack upon the shoulder. “We’ll agree fine yet!” he cried. “I’m just as glad I let you in. And now come awa’ to your bed.”",think say strange nature man seem satisfied conduct father more read seem outgrow distaste ill conceive first person jump come room hit smack shoulder agree cry glad let come bed 
30,"To my surprise, he lit no lamp or candle, but set forth into the dark passage, groped his way, breathing deeply, up a flight of steps, and paused before a door, which he unlocked. I was close upon his heels, having stumbled after him as best I might; and then he bade me go in, for that was my chamber. I did as he bid, but paused after a few steps, and begged a light to go to bed with.",surprise light lamp candle set dark passage grope way breathe flight step pause door unlock close heel stumble good bid go chamber bid pause few step begg light go bed

34,"“Hoot-toot, hoot-toot!” said he. “Lights in a house is a thing I dinnae agree with. I’m unco feared of fires. Good-night to ye, Davie, my man.”  And before I had time to add a further protest, he pulled the door to, and I heard him lock me in from the outside.",hoot take hoot take say light house thing agree fear fire good night man have time add further protest pull door hear lock 
35,"I did not know whether to laugh or cry. The room was as cold as a well, and the bed, when I had found my way to it, as damp as a peat-hag; but by good fortune I had caught up my bundle and my plaid, and rolling myself in the latter, I lay down upon the floor under lee of the big bedstead, and fell speedily asleep.",know laugh cry room cold bed find way damp peat hag good fortune catch bundle plaid roll latter lay floor big bedstead fall asleep 
36,"With the first peep of day I opened my eyes, to find myself in a great chamber, hung with stamped leather, furnished with fine embroidered furniture, and lit by three fair windows. Ten years ago, or perhaps twenty, it must have been as pleasant a room to lie down or to awake in as a man could wish; but damp, dirt, disuse, and the mice and spiders had done their worst since then. Many of the window-panes, besides, were broken; and indeed this was so common a feature in that house, that I believe my uncle must at some time have stood a siege from his indignant neighbours--perhaps with Jennet Clouston at their head.",first peep day open eye find great chamber hang stamp leather furnish fine embroider furniture light fair window year pleasant room lie awake man wish damp dirt disuse mouse spider do bad many window pane break common feature house believe uncle time stand siege indignant neighbour head 
37,"Meanwhile the sun was shining outside; and being very cold in that miserable room, I knocked and shouted till my gaoler came and let me out. He carried me to the back of the house, where was a draw-well, and told me to “wash my face there, if I wanted;” and when that was done, I made the best of my own way back to the kitchen, where he had lit the fire and was making the porridge. The table was laid with two bowls and two horn spoons, but the same single measure of small beer. Perhaps my eye rested on this particular with some surprise, and perhaps my uncle observed it; for he spoke up as if in answer to my thought, asking me if I would like to drink ale--for so he called it.",sun shine cold miserable room knock shout gaoler come let carry back house draw tell wash face want do make good own way kitchen light fire make porridge table lay bowl horn spoon same single measure small beer eye rest particular surprise uncle observe speak answer thought ask like drink ale call

40,"He fetched another cup from the shelf; and then, to my great surprise, instead of drawing more beer, he poured an accurate half from one cup to the other. There was a kind of nobleness in this that took my breath away; if my uncle was certainly a miser, he was one of that thorough breed that goes near to make the vice respectable.",fetched cup shelf great surprise draw more beer pour accurate half cup other be kind nobleness take breath uncle miser thorough breed go make vice respectable 
41,"When we had made an end of our meal, my uncle Ebenezer unlocked a drawer, and drew out of it a clay pipe and a lump of tobacco, from which he cut one fill before he locked it up again. Then he sat down in the sun at one of the windows and silently smoked. From time to time his eyes came coasting round to me, and he shot out one of his questions. Once it was, “And your mother?” and when I had told him that she, too, was dead, “Ay, she was a bonnie lassie!” Then, after another long pause, “Whae were these friends o’ yours?”",make end meal uncle unlock drawer draw clay pipe lump tobacco cut fill lock sit sun window smoke time time eye come coast shoot question mother tell dead bonnie lassie long pause friend 
42,"I told him they were different gentlemen of the name of Campbell; though, indeed, there was only one, and that the minister, that had ever taken the least note of me; but I began to think my uncle made too light of my position, and finding myself all alone with him, I did not wish him to suppose me helpless.",tell different gentleman name be minister take least note begin think uncle make light position find wish suppose helpless 
43,"He seemed to turn this over in his mind; and then, “Davie, my man,” said he, “ye’ve come to the right bit when ye came to your uncle Ebenezer. I’ve a great notion of the family, and I mean to do the right by you; but while I’m taking a bit think to mysel’ of what’s the best thing to put you to--whether the law, or the meenistry, or maybe the army, whilk is what boys are fondest of--I wouldnae like the Balfours to be humbled before a wheen Hieland Campbells, and I’ll ask you to keep your tongue within your teeth.

It was by no will of mine that I came seeking you; and if you show me your door again, I’ll take you at the word.”",say have manner reason suppose mean have know have pride own will come seek show door take word 
45,"He seemed grievously put out. “Hoots-toots,” said he, “ca’ cannie, man--ca’ cannie! Bide a day or two. I’m nae warlock, to find a fortune for you in the bottom of a parritch bowl; but just you give me a day or two, and say naething to naebody, and as sure as sure, I’ll do the right by you.”",seem put hoot toot say cannie man ca’ cannie be day noe warlock find fortune bottom parritch bowl give day say naeth naebody sure sure do right 
46,"“Very well,” said I, “enough said. If you want to help me, there’s no doubt but I’ll be glad of it, and none but I’ll be grateful.”",say say want help be doubt glad grateful 
47,"It seemed to me (too soon, I dare say) that I was getting the upper hand of my uncle; and I began next to say that I must have the bed and bedclothes aired and put to sun-dry; for nothing would make me sleep in such a pickle.",seem say get upper hand uncle begin say have bed bedclothe air put sun-dry make sleep pickle 
48,"“Is this my house or yours?” said he, in his keen voice, and then all of a sudden broke off. “Na, na,” said he, “I didnae mean that. What’s mine is yours, Davie, my man, and what’s yours is mine. Blood’s thicker than water; and there’s naebody but you and me that ought the name.” And then on he rambled about the family, and its ancient greatness, and his father that began to enlarge the house, and himself that stopped the building as a sinful waste; and this put it in my head to give him Jennet Clouston’s message.",house say keen voice break say mean man blood thick water be naebody ought name ramble family ancient greatness father begin enlarge house stop building sinful waste put head give message

A witch--a proclaimed witch! I’ll aff and see the session clerk.”",limmer cry hunner day have limmer rowpit have roast red peat witch proclaim witch see session clerk

51,"And with that he opened a chest, and got out a very old and well-preserved blue coat and waistcoat, and a good enough beaver hat, both without lace. These he threw on any way, and taking a staff from the cupboard, locked all up again, and was for setting out, when a thought arrested him.",open chest get old preserve blue coat waistcoat good enough beaver hat lace throw way take staff cupboard lock set thought arrest

56,"“Sir,” says I, “with a proper reverence for your age and our common blood, I do not value your favour at a boddle’s purchase. I was brought up to have a good conceit of myself; and if you were all the uncle, and all the family, I had in the world ten times over, I wouldn’t buy your liking at such prices.”",say proper reverence age common blood value favour boddle purchase bring have good conceit uncle family have world time buy like such price 
57,"Uncle Ebenezer went and looked out of the window for awhile. I could see him all trembling and twitching, like a man with palsy. But when he turned round, he had a smile upon his face.",go look window see tremble twitch man palsy turn have smile face 
58,"“Well, well,” said he, “we must bear and forbear. I’ll no go; that’s all that’s to be said of it.”",say bear forbear go say 
59,"“Uncle Ebenezer,” I said, “I can make nothing out of this. You use me like a thief; you hate to have me in this house; you let me see it, every word and every minute: it’s not possible that you can like me; and as for me, I’ve spoken to you as I never thought to speak to any man. Why do you seek to keep me, then? Let me gang back--let me gang back to the friends I have, and that like me!”",say make use thief hate have house let see word minute possible like speak think speak man seek keep let gang let gang friend have

Bide here quiet, there’s a good lad; just you bide here quiet a bittie, and ye’ll find that we agree.”",say like fine agree fine honour house let leave way come be quiet be good lad bide quiet bittie find agree 
61,"“Well, sir,” said I, after I had thought the matter out in silence, “I’ll stay awhile. It’s more just I should be helped by my own blood than strangers; and if we don’t agree, I’ll do my best it shall be through no fault of mine.”",sir say think matter silence stay help own blood stranger agree do good fault
