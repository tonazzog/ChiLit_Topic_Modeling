4,"and this was displayed to the Green Dragon about a fortnight after the arrival of the wonderful hamper. The old gentleman saw it, and waved a cheerful response from the train. And when this had been done the children saw that now was the time when they must tell Mother what they had done when she was ill. And it did not seem nearly so easy as they had thought it would be. But it had to be done. And it was done. Mother was extremely angry. She was seldom angry, and now she was angrier than they had ever known her. This was horrible. But it was much worse when she suddenly began to cry. Crying is catching, I believe, like measles and whooping-cough. At any rate, everyone at once found itself taking part in a crying-party.",display green fortnight arrival wonderful hamper old gentleman see wave cheerful response train do child see time tell mother do ill seem easy think have do do mother angry angry angry know horrible bad begin cry crying catching believe measle whooping cough rate find take part cry party

8,"“Now, listen,” said Mother; “it’s quite true that we’re poor, but we have enough to live on. You mustn’t go telling everyone about our affairs--it’s not right. And you must never, never, never ask strangers to give you things. Now always remember that--won’t you?”",listen say mother true poor have enough live go tell affair right ask stranger give thing remember 
9,They all hugged her and rubbed their damp cheeks against hers and promised that they would.,hugge rub damp cheek promise 
10,"“And I’ll write a letter to your old gentleman, and I shall tell him that I didn’t approve--oh, of course I shall thank him, too, for his kindness. It’s YOU I don’t approve of, my darlings, not the old gentleman. He was as kind as ever he could be. And you can give the letter to the Station Master to give him--and we won’t say any more about it.”",write letter old gentleman tell approve course thank kindness approve darling old gentleman kind give letter give say more 
11,"Afterwards, when the children were alone, Bobbie said:--",child alone say 
12,“Isn’t Mother splendid? You catch any other grown-up saying they were sorry they had been angry.”,mother splendid catch other grow say sorry angry 
13,"“Yes,” said Peter, “she IS splendid; but it’s rather awful when she’s angry.”",say splendid awful angry

20,"Then the Station Master retired to that sacred inner temple behind the little window where the tickets are sold, and the children went down to the Porters’ room and talked to the Porter. They learned several interesting things from him--among others that his name was Perks, that he was married and had three children, that the lamps in front of engines are called head-lights and the ones at the back tail-lights.",retire sacred inner temple little window ticket sell child go room talk learn several interesting thing other name marry have child lamp front engine call head light one back tail light

22,It was on this day that the children first noticed that all engines are not alike.,day child notice engine alike 
23,"“Alike?” said the Porter, whose name was Perks, “lor, love you, no, Miss. No more alike nor what you an’ me are. That little ‘un without a tender as went by just now all on her own, that was a tank, that was--she’s off to do some shunting t’other side o’ Maidbridge. That’s as it might be you, Miss. Then there’s goods engines, great, strong things with three wheels each side--joined with rods to strengthen ‘em--as it might be me. Then there’s main-line engines as it might be this ‘ere young gentleman when he grows up and wins all the races at ‘is school--so he will. The main-line engine she’s built for speed as well as power.

29,Next day was Roberta’s birthday. In the afternoon she was politely but firmly requested to get out of the way and keep there till tea-time.,next day birthday afternoon request get way keep tea- time 
30,"“You aren’t to see what we’re going to do till it’s done; it’s a glorious surprise,” said Phyllis.",see go do do glorious surprise say 
31,"And Roberta went out into the garden all alone. She tried to be grateful, but she felt she would much rather have helped in whatever it was than have to spend her birthday afternoon by herself, no matter how glorious the surprise might be.",go garden try grateful feel help have spend birthday afternoon matter glorious surprise 
32,"Now that she was alone, she had time to think, and one of the things she thought of most was what mother had said in one of those feverish nights when her hands were so hot and her eyes so bright.",alone have time think thing think most mother say feverish night hand hot eye bright 
33,"The words were: “Oh, what a doctor’s bill there’ll be for this!”",word doctor bill 
34,"She walked round and round the garden among the rose-bushes that hadn’t any roses yet, only buds, and the lilac bushes and syringas and American currants, and the more she thought of the doctor’s bill, the less she liked the thought of it.",walk garden rose bush have rose bud lilac bush syringa american currant more think doctor bill less like thought 
35,"And presently she made up her mind. She went out through the side door of the garden and climbed up the steep field to where the road runs along by the canal. She walked along until she came to the bridge that crosses the canal and leads to the village, and here she waited. It was very pleasant in the sunshine to lean one’s elbows on the warm stone of the bridge and look down at the blue water of the canal. Bobbie had never seen any other canal, except the Regent’s Canal, and the water of that is not at all a pretty colour. And she had never seen any river at all except the Thames, which also would be all the better if its face was washed.",make mind go side door garden climb steep field road run canal walk come bridge cross canal lead village wait pleasant sunshine lean elbow warm stone bridge look blue water canal see other canal water pretty colour see river good face wash 
36,"Perhaps the children would have loved the canal as much as the railway, but for two things. One was that they had found the railway FIRST--on that first, wonderful morning when the house and the country and the moors and rocks and great hills were all new to them. They had not found the canal till some days later. The other reason was that everyone on the railway had been kind to them--the Station Master, the Porter, and the old gentleman who waved. And the people on the canal were anything but kind.",child love canal much railway thing find railway first first wonderful morning house country moor rock great hill new find canal day other reason railway kind old gentleman wave person canal kind 
37,"The people on the canal were, of course, the bargees, who steered the slow barges up and down, or walked beside the old horses that trampled up the mud of the towing-path, and strained at the long tow-ropes.",person canal course bargee steer slow barge walk old horse trample mud towing path strain long tow rope 
38,"Peter had once asked one of the bargees the time, and had been told to “get out of that,” in a tone so fierce that he did not stop to say anything about his having just as much right on the towing-path as the man himself. Indeed, he did not even think of saying it till some time later.",ask bargee time tell get tone fierce stop say have much towing path man think say time 
39,"Then another day when the children thought they would like to fish in the canal, a boy in a barge threw lumps of coal at them, and one of these hit Phyllis on the back of the neck. She was just stooping down to tie up her bootlace--and though the coal hardly hurt at all it made her not care very much about going on fishing.",day child think like fish canal boy barge throw lump coal hit back neck stoop tie bootlace coal hurt make care go fishing 
40,"On the bridge, however, Roberta felt quite safe, because she could look down on the canal, and if any boy showed signs of meaning to throw coal, she could duck behind the parapet.",bridge feel safe look canal boy show sign meaning throw coal duck parapet 
41,"Presently there was a sound of wheels, which was just what she expected.",be sound wheel expect 
42,"The wheels were the wheels of the Doctor’s dogcart, and in the cart, of course, was the Doctor.",wheel wheel dogcart cart course

61,“Yes?”,
62,"“You see she told me what a good doctor you were, and I asked her how she could afford you, because she’s much poorer than we are. I’ve been in her house and I know. And then she told me about the Club, and I thought I’d ask you--and--oh, I don’t want Mother to be worried! Can’t we be in the Club, too, the same as Mrs. Viney?”",see tell good doctor ask afford poorer house know tell think ask want mother worried same

65,The Doctor roused himself.,rouse

68,"“A water bridge,” said the Doctor. “Look.”",water bridge say look 
69,The road rose to a bridge over the canal. To the left was a steep rocky cliff with trees and shrubs growing in the cracks of the rock. And the canal here left off running along the top of the hill and started to run on a bridge of its own--a great bridge with tall arches that went right across the valley.,road rise bridge canal left steep rocky cliff tree shrub grow crack rock canal leave run top hill start run bridge own great bridge tall arche go valley 
70,Bobbie drew a long breath.,draw long breath 
71,"“It IS grand, isn’t it?” she said. “It’s like pictures in the History of Rome.”",grand say picture 
72,"“Right!” said the Doctor, “that’s just exactly what it IS like. The Romans were dead nuts on aqueducts. It’s a splendid piece of engineering.”",right say dead nut aqueduct splendid piece engineering 
73,“I thought engineering was making engines.”,think engineering make engine 
74,"“Ah, there are different sorts of engineering--making road and bridges and tunnels is one kind. And making fortifications is another. Well, we must be turning back. And, remember, you aren’t to worry about doctor’s bills or you’ll be ill yourself, and then I’ll send you in a bill as long as the aqueduct.”",be different sort engineering make road bridge tunnel kind make fortification turn remember worry doctor bill ill send bill aqueduct 
75,"When Bobbie had parted from the Doctor at the top of the field that ran down from the road to Three Chimneys, she could not feel that she had done wrong. She knew that Mother would perhaps think differently. But Bobbie felt that for once she was the one who was right, and she scrambled down the rocky slope with a really happy feeling.",part top field run road feel do wrong know mother think feel one right scramble rocky slope happy feeling 
76,"Phyllis and Peter met her at the back door. They were unnaturally clean and neat, and Phyllis had a red bow in her hair. There was only just time for Bobbie to make herself tidy and tie up her hair with a blue bow before a little bell rang.",meet back door clean neat have red bow hair be time make tidy tie hair blue bow little bell ring 
77,"“There!” said Phyllis, “that’s to show the surprise is ready. Now you wait till the bell rings again and then you may come into the dining-room.”",say show surprise ready wait bell ring come dining room 
78,So Bobbie waited.,wait 
79,"“Tinkle, tinkle,” said the little bell, and Bobbie went into the dining-room, feeling rather shy. Directly she opened the door she found herself, as it seemed, in a new world of light and flowers and singing. Mother and Peter and Phyllis were standing in a row at the end of the table. The shutters were shut and there were twelve candles on the table, one for each of Roberta’s years. The table was covered with a sort of pattern of flowers, and at Roberta’s place was a thick wreath of forget-me-nots and several most interesting little packages. And Mother and Phyllis and Peter were singing--to the first part of the tune of St. Patrick’s Day. Roberta knew that Mother had written the words on purpose for her birthday. It was a little way of Mother’s on birthdays. It had begun on Bobbie’s fourth birthday when Phyllis was a baby. Bobbie remembered learning the verses to say to Father ‘for a surprise.’ She wondered if Mother had remembered, too. The four-year-old verse had been:--",tinkle tinkle say little bell go dining room feel shy open door find seem new world light flower singing mother stand row end table shutter shut be candle table year table cover sort pattern flower place thick wreath forget not several interesting little package sing first part tune know write word purpose birthday little way mother birthday begin fourth birthday baby remember learn verse say surprise wonder mother remember year old verse

83,"When they had finished singing they cried, “Three cheers for our Bobbie!” and gave them very loudly. Bobbie felt exactly as though she were going to cry--you know that odd feeling in the bridge of your nose and the pricking in your eyelids? But before she had time to begin they were all kissing and hugging her.",finish sing cry cheer give feel go cry know odd feeling bridge nose pricking eyelid have time begin kiss hug 
84,"“Now,” said Mother, “look at your presents.”",say mother look present 
85,"They were very nice presents. There was a green and red needle-book that Phyllis had made herself in secret moments. There was a darling little silver brooch of Mother’s shaped like a buttercup, which Bobbie had known and loved for years, but which she had never, never thought would come to be her very own. There was also a pair of blue glass vases from Mrs. Viney. Roberta had seen and admired them in the village shop. And there were three birthday cards with pretty pictures and wishes.",nice present be green red needle book make secret moment be darling little silver brooch shape buttercup know love year think come own be pair blue glass vase see admire village shop be birthday card pretty picture wish

87,"“And now look at the table,” she said.",look table say 
88,"There was a cake on the table covered with white sugar, with ‘Dear Bobbie’ on it in pink sweets, and there were buns and jam; but the nicest thing was that the big table was almost covered with flowers--wallflowers were laid all round the tea-tray--there was a ring of forget-me-nots round each plate. The cake had a wreath of white lilac round it, and in the middle was something that looked like a pattern all done with single blooms of lilac or wallflower or laburnum.",be cake table cover white sugar dear pink sweet be bun jam nice thing big table cover flower wallflower lay tea tray be ring forget not plate cake have wreath white lilac middle look pattern do single bloom lilac wallflower laburnum

The laburnum is the train, and there are the signal-boxes, and the road up to here--and those fat red daisies are us three waving to the old gentleman--that’s him, the pansy in the laburnum train.”",map map railway cry look lilac line metal be station do brown wallflower laburnum train be signal box road fat red daisy wave old gentleman pansy laburnum train

Peter invented it all, and we got all the flowers from the station. We thought you’d like it better.”",be chimney do purple primrose say little tiny rose bud mother look late tea invent get flower station think like good 
91,"“That’s my present,” said Peter, suddenly dumping down his adored steam-engine on the table in front of her. Its tender had been lined with fresh white paper, and was full of sweets.",present say dump adore steam engine table front tender line fresh white paper full sweet 
92,"“Oh, Peter!” cried Bobbie, quite overcome by this munificence, “not your own dear little engine that you’re so fond of?”",cry overcome munificence own dear little engine fond 
93,"“Oh, no,” said Peter, very promptly, “not the engine. Only the sweets.”",say engine sweet 
94,"Bobbie couldn’t help her face changing a little--not so much because she was disappointed at not getting the engine, as because she had thought it so very noble of Peter, and now she felt she had been silly to think it. Also she felt she must have seemed greedy to expect the engine as well as the sweets. So her face changed. Peter saw it. He hesitated a minute; then his face changed, too, and he said: “I mean not ALL the engine. I’ll let you go halves if you like.”",help face change little much disappointed get engine think noble feel silly think feel seem greedy expect engine sweet face change see hesitate minute face change say mean engine let go half like 
95,"“You’re a brick,” cried Bobbie; “it’s a splendid present.” She said no more aloud, but to herself she said:--",brick cry splendid present say say 
96,"“That was awfully jolly decent of Peter because I know he didn’t mean to. Well, the broken half shall be my half of the engine, and I’ll get it mended and give it back to Peter for his birthday.”--“Yes, Mother dear, I should like to cut the cake,” she added, and tea began.",jolly decent know mean break half half engine get mend give birthday mother dear like cut cake add tea begin 
97,"It was a delightful birthday. After tea Mother played games with them--any game they liked--and of course their first choice was blindman’s-buff, in the course of which Bobbie’s forget-me-not wreath twisted itself crookedly over one of her ears and stayed there. Then, when it was near bed-time and time to calm down, Mother had a lovely new story to read to them.",delightful birthday tea mother play game game like course first choice blindman buff course forget wreath twist ear stay bed time time calm mother have lovely new story read 
98,"“You won’t sit up late working, will you, Mother?” Bobbie asked as they said good night.",sit work mother ask say good night 
99,"And Mother said no, she wouldn’t--she would only just write to Father and then go to bed.",mother say write go bed 
100,"But when Bobbie crept down later to bring up her presents--for she felt she really could not be separated from them all night--Mother was not writing, but leaning her head on her arms and her arms on the table. I think it was rather good of Bobbie to slip quietly away, saying over and over, “She doesn’t want me to know she’s unhappy, and I won’t know; I won’t know.” But it made a sad end to the birthday.",creep bring present feel separate night mother write lean head arm arm table think good slip say want know unhappy know know make sad end birthday

102,The very next morning Bobbie began to watch her opportunity to get Peter’s engine mended secretly. And the opportunity came the very next afternoon.,next morning begin watch opportunity get engine mend opportunity come very next afternoon 
103,"Mother went by train to the nearest town to do shopping. When she went there, she always went to the Post-office. Perhaps to post her letters to Father, for she never gave them to the children or Mrs. Viney to post, and she never went to the village herself. Peter and Phyllis went with her. Bobbie wanted an excuse not to go, but try as she would she couldn’t think of a good one. And just when she felt that all was lost, her frock caught on a big nail by the kitchen door and there was a great criss-cross tear all along the front of the skirt. I assure you this was really an accident. So the others pitied her and went without her, for there was no time for her to change, because they were rather late already and had to hurry to the station to catch the train.",mother go train near town do shopping go go office post letter give child post go village go want excuse go try think good one feel lose frock catch big nail kitchen door be great criss cross tear front skirt assure accident other pity go be time change late have hurry station catch train 
104,"When they had gone, Bobbie put on her everyday frock, and went down to the railway. She did not go into the station, but she went along the line to the end of the platform where the engine is when the down train is alongside the platform--the place where there are a water tank and a long, limp, leather hose, like an elephant’s trunk. She hid behind a bush on the other side of the railway. She had the toy engine done up in brown paper, and she waited patiently with it under her arm.",go put everyday frock go railway go station go line end platform engine down train platform place be water tank long limp leather hose elephant trunk hide bush other side railway have toy engine do brown paper wait arm 
105,"Then when the next train came in and stopped, Bobbie went across the metals of the up-line and stood beside the engine. She had never been so close to an engine before. It looked much larger and harder than she had expected, and it made her feel very small indeed, and, somehow, very soft--as if she could very, very easily be hurt rather badly.",next train come stop go metal line stand engine close engine look large hard expect make feel small soft hurt 
106,"“I know what silk-worms feel like now,” said Bobbie to herself.",know silk worm feel say

108,"“If you please,” said Roberta--but the engine was blowing off steam and no one heard her.",say engine blow steam hear 
109,"“If you please, Mr. Engineer,” she spoke a little louder, but the Engine happened to speak at the same moment, and of course Roberta’s soft little voice hadn’t a chance.",speak little louder engine happen speak same moment course soft little voice have chance 
110,"It seemed to her that the only way would be to climb on to the engine and pull at their coats. The step was high, but she got her knee on it, and clambered into the cab; she stumbled and fell on hands and knees on the base of the great heap of coals that led up to the square opening in the tender. The engine was not above the weaknesses of its fellows; it was making a great deal more noise than there was the slightest need for. And just as Roberta fell on the coals, the engine-driver, who had turned without seeing her, started the engine, and when Bobbie had picked herself up, the train was moving--not fast, but much too fast for her to get off.",seem only way climb engine pull coat step high get knee clamber cab stumble fall hand knee base great heap coal lead square opening tender engine weakness fellow make great deal more noise be slight need fall coal engine driver turn see start engine pick train move fast fast get 
111,"All sorts of dreadful thoughts came to her all together in one horrible flash. There were such things as express trains that went on, she supposed, for hundreds of miles without stopping. Suppose this should be one of them? How would she get home again? She had no money to pay for the return journey.",sort dreadful thought come horrible flash be such thing express train go suppose hundred mile stop suppose get have money pay return journey

113,There was something in her throat that made it impossible for her to speak. She tried twice. The men had their backs to her. They were doing something to things that looked like taps.,be throat make impossible speak try man have back do thing look tap 
114,"Suddenly she put out her hand and caught hold of the nearest sleeve. The man turned with a start, and he and Roberta stood for a minute looking at each other in silence. Then the silence was broken by them both.",put hand catch hold near sleeve man turn start stand minute look other silence silence break

119,"She did stop, as soon as she could. One thing that helped her was the thought that Peter would give almost his ears to be in her place--on a real engine--really going. The children had often wondered whether any engine-driver could be found noble enough to take them for a ride on an engine--and now there she was. She dried her eyes and sniffed earnestly.",stop thing help thought give ear place real engine go child wonder engine driver find noble take ride engine dry eye sniff
