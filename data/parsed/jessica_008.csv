1,CHAPTER VIII. AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.,unexpected visitor 
2," When Jessica came to the street into which the court where she lived opened, she saw an unusual degree of excitement among the inhabitants, a group of whom were gathered about a tall gentleman whom she recognized in an instant to be the minister. She elbowed her way through the midst of them, and the minister’s face brightened as she presented herself before him. He followed her up the low entry, across the squalid court, through the stable, empty of the donkeys just then, up the creaking rounds of the ladder, and into the miserable loft where the tiles were falling in and the broken window-panes were stuffed with rags and paper. Near to the old rusty stove, which served as a grate when there was any fire, there was a short board laid across some bricks, and upon this the minister took his seat, while Jessica sat upon the floor before him.",come street court live open see unusual degree excitement inhabitant group gather tall gentleman recognize instant minister elbow way midst minister face brighten present follow low entry squalid court stable empty donkey creaking round ladder miserable loft tile fall break window pane stuff rag paper old rusty stove serve grate be fire be short board lay brick minister take seat sit floor

24,"“Jessica,” he answered, “I will tell you what I will do. I will trust you with a shilling every Sunday, if you’ll promise to give it to your friend the very first time you see him. I shall be sure to know if you cheat me.” And the keen, piercing eyes of the minister looked down into Jessica’s, and once more the tender and pitying smile returned to his face.",answer tell do trust shilling promise give friend very first time see sure know cheat keen piercing eye minister look tender pitying smile return face

27,"“I will tell you one thing about him now,” he replied. “If I took you to live in my house with my little daughters you would have to be washed and clothed in new clothing to make you fit for it. God wanted us to go and live at home with him in heaven, but we were so sinful that we could never have been fit for it. So he sent his own Son to live among us, and die for us, to wash us from our sins, and to give us new clothing, and to make us ready to live in God’s house. When you ask God for any thing you must say, ‘For Jesus Christ’s sake.’ Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”",tell thing reply take live house little daughter have wash cloth new clothing make fit want go live home heaven sinful fit send own son live die wash sin give new clothing make ready live house ask thing say sake son 
28,"After these words the minister carefully descended the ladder, followed by Jessica’s bare and nimble feet, and she led him by the nearest way into one of the great thoroughfares of the city, where he said good-by to her, adding, “God bless you, my child,” in a tone which sank into Jessica’s heart.",word minister descend ladder follow bare nimble foot lead near way great thoroughfare city say good add bless child tone sink heart

31,"He felt a little troubled as he heard her story, lest the minister should endeavor to find him out; but he could not refuse to let the child come daily for her comfortable breakfast. If he was detected, he would promise to give up his coffee-stall rather than offend the great people of the chapel; but unless he was it would be foolish of him to lose the money it brought in week after week.",feel little troubled hear story minister endeavor find refuse let child come comfortable breakfast detect promise give coffee stall offend great person chapel foolish lose money bring week week
