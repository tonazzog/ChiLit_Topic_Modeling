2," The secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in.  Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones.  Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother.  In the company of his ""creatures"" he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed.  While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.",secret garden only one work cottage moor be piece ground enclose low wall rough stone morning fade twilight day see work plant tend potato cabbage turnip carrot herb mother company creature wonder tired do seem dig weed whistle sing bit song talk brother sister teach help

4,When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him. After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time.  She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day.  She loved this time.  There were not only vegetables in this garden.  Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps.  The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.,find moment spare like go talk supper be long clear twilight work quiet time sit low rough wall look hear story day love time be vegetable garden buy penny package flower seed sow bright sweet scent thing gooseberry bush cabbage grow border mignonette pink pansie thing seed save year year root bloom spring spread time fine clump low wall prettiest thing tuck moorland foxglove fern rock cress hedgerow flower crevice glimpse stone see

6,"It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor.  At first she was only told that ""Mester Colin"" had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good.  But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might ""come into the secret."" Somehow it was not doubted that she was ""safe for sure.""",twilight hour hear happen first tell take fancy go grounds do good agree child mother come secret doubt safe sure 
7,"So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal.  The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.",beautiful evening tell whole story thrilling detail bury key robin gray haze seem deadness secret plan reveal coming tell doubt final drama introduction hide domain combine incident angry face peer wall sudden indignant strength make nice look face change color several time

Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table--particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover--they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.",make mind eat less possible carry brilliant idea waken morning amazing appetite table sofa set breakfast home make bread fresh butter snow white egg raspberry jam clote cream breakfast find table be delicate slice sizzle ham send tempting odor hot silver cover look other eye desperation

Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king--besides being deliciously satisfying.  You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.,make stimulate discovery wood park garden find pipe wild creature deep little hollow build sort tiny oven stone roast potato egg roasted egg unknown luxury hot potato salt fresh butter fit woodland king satisfy buy potato egg eat many like feel take food mouth person 
53,Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended.  After the ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals.  Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground.  And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger--as well it might.  He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.,beautiful morning work mystic circle plum tree provide canopy thicken green leave brief blossom time end ceremony take walking exercise day exercise find power interval day grow strong walk cover more ground day belief grow strong try experiment feel gain strength show good thing

59,"Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises.  Colin watched them with widening eyes.  He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet.  Mary began to do them also.

It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost.  But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again.

63,"Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at--but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa and examined him.  He had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks.  When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly.  The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out.  His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life.  His lips were fuller and of a normal color.  In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight.
