3,"At Roslyn, even in summer, the hour for going to bed was half-past nine. It was hardly likely that so many boys, overflowing with turbulent life, should lie down quietly, and get to sleep. They never dreamt of doing so. Very soon after the masters were gone, the sconces were often relighted, sometimes in separate dormitories, sometimes in all of them, and the boys amused themselves by reading novels or making a row. They would play various games about the bedrooms, vaulting or jumping over the beds, running races in sheets, getting through the windows upon the roofs, to frighten the study-boys with sham ghosts, or playing the thousand other pranks which suggested themselves to the fertile imagination of fifteen. But the favorite amusement was a bolstering match. One room would challenge another, and, stripping the covers off their bolsters, would meet in mortal fray. A bolster well wielded, especially when dexterously applied to the legs, is a very efficient instrument to bring a boy to the ground; but it doesn't hurt very much, even when the blows fall on the head. Hence these matches were excellent trials of strength and temper, and were generally accompanied with shouts of laughter, never ending until one side was driven back to its own room. Many a long and tough struggle had Eric enjoyed, and his prowess was so universally acknowledged, that his dormitory, No. 7, was a match for any other, and far stronger in this warfare than most of the rest. At bolstering, Duncan was a perfect champion; his strength and activity were marvellous, and his mirth uproarious. Eric and Graham backed him up brilliantly; while Llewellyn and Attlay, with sturdy vigor, supported the skirmishers. Bull, the sixth boy in No. 7, was the only _fainéant_ among them, though he did occasionally help to keep off the smaller fry.",summer hour go bed half past likely many boy overflow turbulent life lie get sleep dreamt do master gone sconce relight separate dormitory boy amuse read novel make row play various game bedroom vault jump bed run race sheet get window roof frighten study boy sham ghost play other prank suggest fertile imagination favorite amusement bolster match room challenge stripp cover bolster meet mortal fray bolster wield apply leg efficient instrument bring boy ground hurt blow fall head match excellent trial strength temper accompany shout laughter end side drive own room many long tough struggle enjoy prowess acknowledge dormitory no. match other strong warfare most rest bolster perfect champion strength activity marvellous mirth uproarious back sturdy vigor support skirmisher sixth boy no. only _fainéant_ help keep small fry 
4,"Happy would it have been for all of them if Bull had never been placed in No. 7; happier still if he had never come to Roslyn school. Backward in work, overflowing with vanity at his supposed good looks, of mean disposition and feeble intellect, he was the very worst specimen of a boy that Eric had ever seen. Not even Barker so deeply excited Eric's repulsion and contempt. And yet, since the affair of Upton, Barker and Eric were declared enemies, and, much to the satisfaction of the latter, never spoke to each other; but with Bull--much as he inwardly loathed him--he was professedly and apparently on good terms. His silly love of universal popularity made him accept and tolerate the society even of this worthless boy.",happy place no. happy come school work overflow vanity suppose good look mean disposition feeble intellect bad specimen boy see excite repulsion contempt affair declare enemy much satisfaction latter speak other much loath good term silly love universal popularity make accept tolerate society worthless boy 
5,"Any two boys talking to each other about Bull would probably profess to like him ""well enough,"" but if they were honest, they would generally end by allowing their contempt.",boy talk other profess like honest end allow contempt

20,"Bull had been to school before, and of this school he often bragged as the acmé of desirability and wickedness. He was always telling boys what they did at ""his old school,"" and he quite inflamed the minds of such as fell under his influence by marvellous tales of the wild and wilful things which he and his former school-fellows had done. Many and many a scheme of sin and mischief, at Roslyn was suggested, planned, and carried out on the model of Bull's reminiscences of his previous life.",school school bragg acmé desirability wickedness tell boy do old school inflame mind such fall influence marvellous tale wild wilful thing former school fellow do many many scheme sin mischief suggest plan carry model reminiscence previous life 
21,"He had tasted more largely of the tree of the knowledge of evil than any other boy, and strange to say, this was the secret why the general odium was never expressed. He claimed his guilty experience so often as a ground of superiority, that at last the claim was silently allowed. He spoke from the platform of more advanced iniquity, and the others listened first curiously, then eagerly to his words.",taste tree knowledge evil other boy strange say secret general odium express claim guilty experience ground superiority last claim allow speak platform advanced iniquity other listen word 
22,"""Ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."" Such was the temptation which assailed the other boys in dormitory No. 7; and Eric among the number. Bull was the tempter. Secretly, gradually, he dropped into their too willing ears the poison of his polluting acquirements.",god know good evil such temptation assail other boy dormitory no. number tempter drop willing ear poison pollute acquirement 
23,"In brief, Bull was cursed with a degraded and corrupting mind.",brief curse degrade corrupt mind

25,"The first time that Eric heard indecent words in dormitory No. 7, he was shocked beyond bound or measure. Dark though it was, he felt himself blushing scarlet to the roots of his hair, and then growing pale again, while a hot dew was left upon his forehead. Bull was the speaker; but this time there was a silence, and the subject instantly dropped. The others felt that ""a new boy"" was in the room; they did not know how he would take it; they were unconsciously abashed.",first time hear indecent word dormitory no. shocked bound measure dark feel blush scarlet root hair grow pale hot dew leave forehead speaker time be silence subject drop other feel new boy room know take abash 
26,"Besides, though they had themselves joined in such conversation before, they did not love it, and on the contrary, felt ashamed of yielding to it.",have join such conversation love contrary feel ashamed yield 
27,"Now, Eric, now or never! Life and death, ruin and salvation, corruption and purity, are perhaps in the balance together, and the scale of your destiny may hang on a single word of yours. Speak out, boy! Tell these fellows that unseemly words wound your conscience; tell them that they are ruinous, sinful, damnable; speak out and save yourself and the rest. Virtue is strong and beautiful, Eric, and vice is downcast in her awful presence. Lose your purity of heart, Eric, and you have lost a jewel which the whole world, if it were ""one entire and perfect chrysolite,"" cannot replace.",life death ruin salvation corruption purity balance scale destiny hang single word speak tell fellow unseemly word wind conscience tell ruinous sinful damnable speak save rest virtue strong beautiful vice downcast awful presence lose purity heart lose jewel whole world entire perfect chrysolite replace 
28,"Good spirits guard that young boy, and give him grace in this his hour of trial! Open his eyes that he may see the fiery horses and the fiery chariots of the angels who would defend him, and the dark array of spiritual foes who throng around his bed. Point a pitying finger to the yawning abyss of shame, ruin, and despair that even now perhaps is being cleft under his feet. Show him the garlands of the present and the past, withering at the touch of the Erinnys in the future. In pity, in pity show him the canker which he is introducing into the sap of the tree of life, which shall cause its root to be hereafter as bitterness, and its blossom to go up as dust.",good spirit guard young boy give grace hour trial open eye see fiery horse fiery chariot angel defend dark array spiritual foe throng bed point pity finger yawn abyss shame ruin despair cleft foot show garland present past wither touch future pity pity show canker introduce sap tree life cause root bitterness blossom go dust 
29,"But the sense of sin was on Eric's mind. How _could_ he speak? was not his own language sometimes profane? How--how could he profess to reprove another boy on the ground of morality, when he himself said did things less ruinous perhaps, but equally forbidden?",sense sin mind speak own language profane profess reprove boy ground morality say thing ruinous forbidden 
30,"For half an hour, in an agony of struggle with himself, Eric lay silent. Since Bull's last words nobody had spoken. They were going to sleep. It was too late to speak now, Eric thought. The moment passed by for ever; Eric had listened without objection to foul words, and the irreparable harm was done.",hour agony struggle lay silent last word speak go sleep late speak think moment pass listen objection foul word irreparable harm do 
31,"How easy it would have been to speak! With the temptation, God had provided also a way to escape. Next time it came, it was far harder to resist, and it soon became, to men, impossible.",easy speak temptation provide way escape next time come hard resist become man impossible 
32,"Ah Eric, Eric! how little we know the moments which decide the destinies of life. We live on as usual. The day is a common day, the hour a common hour. We never thought twice about the change of intention, which by one of the accidents--(accidents!)--of life determined for good or for evil, for happiness or misery, the color of our remaining years. The stroke of the pen was done in a moment which led unconsciously to our ruin; the word was uttered quite heedlessly, on which turned for ever the decision of our weal or woe.",little know moment decide destiny life live usual day common day hour common hour think change intention accident accident life determine good evil happiness misery color remain year stroke pen do moment lead ruin word utter turn decision weal woe 
33,"Eric lay silent. The darkness was not broken by the flashing of an angel's wing, the stillness was not syllabled by the sound of an angel's voice; but to his dying day Eric never forgot the moments which passed, until, weary and self-reproachful, he fell asleep.",lay silent darkness break flash angel wing stillness syllabl sound angel voice die day forget moment pass weary self reproachful fall asleep 
34,"Next morning he awoke, restless and feverish. He at once remembered what had passed. Bull's words haunted him; he could not forget them; they burnt within him like the flame of a moral fever. He was moody and petulant, and for a time could hardly conceal his aversion to Bull. Ah Eric! moodiness and petulance cannot save you, but prayerfulness would; one word, Eric, at the throne of grace--one prayer before you go down among the boys, that God in his mercy would wash away, in the blood of his dear Son, your crimson stains, and keep your conscience and memory clean.",next morning awoke restless feverish remember pass word haunt forget burn flame moral fever moody petulant time conceal aversion moodiness petulance save prayerfulness word throne grace prayer go boy mercy wash blood dear son crimson stain keep conscience memory clean 
35,"The boy knelt down for a few minutes, and repeated to himself a few formal words. Had he stayed longer on his knees, he might have given way to a burst of penitence and supplication--but he heard Bull's footstep, and getting up, he ran down stairs to breakfast; so Eric did not pray.",boy knolt few minute repeat few formal word stay knee give way burst penitence supplication hear footstep get run stair breakfast pray 
36,"Conversations did not generally drop so suddenly in dormitory No. 7. On the contrary, they generally flashed along in the liveliest way, till some one said ""Good night;"" and then the boys turned off to sleep. Eric knew this, and instantly conjectured that it was only a sort of respect for him, and ignorance of the manner in which he would consider it, that prevented Duncan and the rest from taking any further notice of Bull's remark. It was therefore no good disburdening his mind to any of them; but he determined to speak about the matter to Russell in their next walk.",conversation drop dormitory no. contrary flash liveliest way one say good night boy turn sleep know conjecture sort respect ignorance manner consider prevent rest take further notice remark good disburden mind determine speak matter next walk 
37,"They usually walked together on Sunday. Dr. Rowlands had discontinued the odious and ridiculous custom of the younger boys taking their exercise under a master's inspection. Boys are not generally fond of constitutionals, so that on the half-holidays they almost entirely confined their open-air exercise to the regular games, and many of them hardly left the play-ground boundaries once a week. But on Sundays they often went walks, each with his favorite friend or companion. When Eric first came as a boarder, he invariably went with Russell on Sunday, and many a pleasant stroll they had taken together, sometimes accompanied by Duncan, Montagu, or Owen. The latter, however, had dropped even this intercourse with Eric, who for the last few weeks had more often gone with his new friend Upton.",walk discontinue odious ridiculous custom young boy take exercise master inspection boy fond constitutionalal half holiday confine open air exercise regular game many leave play ground boundary week go walk favorite friend companion come border go many pleasant stroll take accompany latter drop intercourse last few week go new friend

39,"""O excuse me to-day, Upton,"" said Eric, ""I'm going with your cousin.""",excuse day say go cousin

41,"Russell was rather surprised when Eric came to him and said, ""Come a stroll to Fort Island, Edwin--will you?""",surprised come say come stroll 
42,"""O yes,"" said Russell cheerfully; ""why, we haven't seen each other for some time lately! I was beginning to fancy that you meant to drop me, Eric.""",say see other time begin fancy mean drop 
43,"He spoke with a smile, and in a rallying tone, but Eric hung his head, for the charge was true. Proud of his popularity among all the school, and especially at his friendship with so leading a fellow as Upton, Eric had _not_ seen much of his friend since their last conversation about swearing. Indeed, conscious of failure, he felt sometimes uneasy in Russell's company.",speak smile rallying tone hang head charge true proud popularity school friendship lead fellow see much friend last conversation swearing conscious failure feel uneasy company

48,"Russell only spoke in fun; but, unintentionally, his words jarred in Eric's heart. He was silent, and answered in monosyllables, so the walk was provokingly dull. At last they reached Fort Island, and sat down by the ruined chapel looking on the sea.",speak fun word jarr heart silent answer monosyllable walk dull last reach sit ruin chapel look sea 
49,"""Why what's the row with you, old boy,"" said Montagu, playfully shaking Eric by the shoulder, ""you're as silent as Zimmerman on Solitude, and as doleful as Harvey on the Tombs. I expect you've been going through a select course of Blair's Grave, Young's Night Thoughts, and Drelincourt on Death.""",row old boy say shake shoulder silent doleful expect go select course 
50,"To his surprise Eric's head was still bent, and, at last, he heard a deep suppressed sigh.",surprise head bent last hear deep suppress sigh

52,"Eric had not liked to speak while Montagu was by, but now he gulped down his rising emotion, and briefly told them of Bull's vile words the night before. They listened in silence.",like speak gulp rise emotion tell vile word night listen silence

58,"""Let me tell you,"" said Russell solemnly; ""my father (he is dead now you know, Eric), when I was sent to school, warned me of this kind of thing. I had been brought up in utter ignorance of such coarse knowledge as is forced upon one here, and with my reminiscences of home, I could not bear even that much of it which was impossible to avoid. But the very first time such talk was begun in my dormitory I spoke out. What I said I don't know, but I felt as if I was trampling on a slimy poisonous adder, and, at any rate, I showed such pain and distress that the fellows dropped it at the time. Since then I have absolutely refused to stay in the room if ever such talk is begun. So it never is now, and I do think the fellows are very glad of it themselves.""",let tell say father dead know send school warn kind thing bring utter ignorance such coarse knowledge force reminiscence home bear much impossible avoid very first time such talk begin dormitory speak say know feel trample slimy poisonous adder rate show such pain distress fellow drop time refuse stay room such talk begin think fellow glad 
59,"""Well,"" said Montagu, ""I don't profess to look on it from the religious ground, you know, but I thought it blackguardly, and in bad taste, and said so. The fellow who began it, threatened to kick me for a conceited little fool, but he didn't; and they hardly ever venture on that ground now.""",say profess look religious ground know think bad taste say fellow begin threaten kick conceited little fool venture ground 
60,"""It is more than blackguardly--it is deadly,"" answered Russell; ""my father said it was the most fatal curse which could ever become rife in a public school.""",more deadly answer father say fatal curse become rife public school 
61,"""Why do masters never give us any help or advice on these matters?"" asked Eric thoughtfully.",master give help advice matter ask 
62,"""In sermons they do. Don't you remember Rowlands' sermon not two weeks ago on Kibroth-Hattaavah? But I for one think them quite right not to speak to us privately on such subjects, unless we invite confidence. Besides, they cannot know that any boys talk in this way. After all, it is only a very few of the worst who ever do.""",sermon remember sermon week think right speak such subject invite confidence know boy talk way few bad do

67,"He did for a time, but a general laugh awoke him. He pretended to be asleep, but he listened. Iniquity of this kind was utterly new to him; his curiosity was awakened; he no longer feigned indifference, and the poison flowed deep into his veins. Before that evening was over, Eric Williams was ""a god, knowing good from evil.""",do time general laugh awoke pretend asleep listen iniquity kind new curiosity awaken feign indifference poison flow vein evening god know good evil 
68,"O young boys, if your eyes ever read these pages, pause and beware. The knowledge of evil is ruin, and the continuance in it hell. That little matter--that beginning of evil,--it will be like the snowflake detached by the breath of air from the mountain-top, which, as it rushes down, gains size, and strength, and impetus, till it has swollen to the mighty and irresistible avalanche that overwhelms garden, and field, and village, in a chaos of undistinguishable death.",young boy eye read page pause beware knowledge evil ruin continuance hell little matter beginning evil snowflake detach breath air mountain top rush gain size strength impetus swollen mighty irresistible avalanche overwhelm garden field village chaos undistinguishable death

From the sea and the sod, from foreign graves and English churchyards, they start up and throng around us in the paleness of their fall.
