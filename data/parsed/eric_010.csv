3,"For a few days after the Sunday walk narrated in the last chapter, Upton and Eric cut each other dead. Upton was angry at Eric's declining the honor of his company, and Eric was piqued at Upton's unreasonableness. In the ""taking up"" system, such quarrels were of frequent occurrence, and as the existence of a misunderstanding was generally indicated in this very public way, the variations of good will between such friends generally excited no little notice and amusement among the other boys. But both Upton and Eric were too sensible to carry their differences so far as others similarly circumstanced; each thoroughly enjoyed the other's company, and they generally seized an early opportunity for effecting a reconciliation, which united them more firmly than ever.",few day walk narrate last chapter cut other dead angry decline honor company pique unreasonableness taking system such quarrel frequent occurrence existence misunderstanding indicate public way variation good will such friend excite little notice amusement other boy sensible carry difference other circumstance enjoy other company seize early opportunity effect reconciliation unite 
4,"As soon as Eric had got over his little pique, he made the first advances, by writing a note to Upton, which he slipped under his study door, and which ran as follows:--",get little pique make first advance write note slip study door run follow 
5,"""Dear Horace--Don't let us quarrel about nothing. Silly fellow, why should you be angry with me because for once I wanted to go a walk with Russell, who, by the bye, is twice as good a fellow as you? I shall expect you to make it up directly after prayers.--Yours, if you are not silly, E.W.""",dear let quarrel silly fellow angry want go walk bye good fellow expect make prayer silly 
6,"The consequence was, that as they came out from prayers, Upton seized Eric's hand, and slapped him on the back, after which they had a good laugh over their own foolish fracas, and ran up stairs chattering merrily.",consequence come prayer seize hand slap back have good laugh own foolish fraca run stair chatter 
7,"""There's to be an awful lark in the dormitories tonight,"" said Eric; ""the doctor's gone to a dinner-party, and we're going to have no end of fun.""",be be awful lark dormitory tonight say doctor go dinner party go have end fun 
8,"""Are you? Well, if it gets amusing, come to my study and tell me, I'll come and look on.""",get amusing come study tell come look 
9,"""Very well; depend upon it, I'll come."" And they parted at the foot of the study stairs.",depend come part foot study stair 
10,"It was Mr. Rose's night of duty. He walked slowly up and down the range of Dormitories until every boy seemed ready to get into bed, and then he put out all the candles. So long as he was present, the boys observed the utmost quiet and decorum. All continued quite orderly until he had passed away through the lavatory, and one of the boys following him as a scout, had seen the last glimmer of his candle disappear round the corner at the foot of the great staircase, and heard the library door close behind him.",night duty walk range dormitory boy seem ready get bed put candle present boy observe utmost quiet decorum continue orderly pass lavatory boy follow scout see last glimmer candle disappear corner foot great staircase hear library door close 
11,"After that, particularly as Dr. Rowlands was absent, the boys knew that they were safe from disturbance, and the occupants of No. 7 were the first to stir.",absent boy know safe disturbance occupant no. first stir 
12,"""Now for some fun,"" said Duncan, starting up, and by way of initiative pitching his pillow at Eric's head.",fun say start way initiative pitch pillow head 
13,"""I'll pay you out for that when I'm ready,"" said Eric, laughing; ""but give us a match, first.""",pay ready say laugh give match 
14,"Duncan produced some vestas, and no sooner had they lighted their candle, than several of the dormitory doors began to be thrown open, and one after another all requested a light, which Duncan and Eric conveyed to them in a sort of emulous lampadephoria, so that a length all the twelve dormitories had their sconces lit, and the boys began all sorts of amusement, some in their night-shirts and others with their trousers slipped on. Leap-frog was the prevalent game for a time, but at last Graham suggested theatricals, and they were agreed on.",produce vesta light candle several dormitory door begin throw open request light convey sort emulous lampadephoria length dormitory have sconce light boy begin sort amusement night shirt other trousers slip leap frog prevalent game time last suggest theatrical agree 
15,"""But we're making a regular knock-me-down shindy,"" said Llewellyn; ""somebody must keep cavè.""",make regular knock shindy say keep cavè 
16,"""O, old Rose is safe enough at his Hebrew in the library; no fear of disturbing him if we were dancing hippopotami,"" answered Graham.",old safe library fear disturbing dance hippopotami answer 
17,"But it was generally considered safest to put some one at the top of the stairs, in case of an unexpected diversion in that direction, and little Wright consented to go first. He had only to leave the lavatory door open; and stand at the top of the staircase, and he then commanded for a great distance the only avenue in which danger was expected. If any master's candle appeared n the hall, the boys had full three minutes' warning, and a single loudly-whispered ""cave"" would cause some one in each dormitory instantly to ""douse the glim,"" and shut the door; so that by the time of the adversary's arrival, they would all be (of course) fast asleep in bed, some of them snoring in an alarming manner. Whatever noise the master might have heard, it would be impossible to fix it on any of the sleepers.",consider safe put one top stair case unexpected diversion direction little consent go have leave lavatory door open stand top staircase command great distance only avenue danger expect master candle appear hall boy have full minute warning single whisper cave cause one dormitory douse glim shut door time adversary arrival course asleep bed snore alarming manner noise master hear impossible fix sleeper 
18,"So at the top of the stairs stood little Wright, shoeless, and shivering in his night-gown, but keenly entering into the fun, and not unconscious of the dignity of his position. Meanwhile the rest were getting up a scenic representation of Bombastes Furioso, arranging a stage, piling a lot of beds together for a theatre, and dressing up the actors in the most fantastic apparel.",top stair stand little shoeless shiver night gown enter fun unconscious dignity position rest get scenic representation arrange stage pile lot bed theatre dress actor fantastic apparel 
19,"The impromptu Bombastes excited universal applause, and just at the end Wright ran in through the lavatory.",impromptu excite universal applause end run lavatory 
20,"""I say,"" said the little fellow, ""it's jolly cold standing at the top of the stairs. Won't some one relieve guard?""",say say little fellow jolly cold standing top stair relieve guard 
21,"""O, I will,"" answered Eric, good-naturedly; ""it's a shame that one fellow should have all the bother and none of the fun;"" and he ran to take Wright's post.",answer good shame fellow have bother fun run take post 
22,"After watching a minute or two, he felt sure that there was no danger, and therefore ran up to Upton's study for a change.",watch minute feel sure be danger run study change 
23,"""Well, what's up?"" said the study-boy, approvingly, as he glanced at Eric's laughing eyes.",say study boy glance laugh eye 
24,"""O, we've been having leap-frog, and then Bombastes Furioso. But I'm keeping 'cavè' now; only it's so cold that I thought I'd run up to your study.""",have leap frog keep cavè cold think run study 
25,"""Little traitor; we'll shoot you for a deserting sentinel.""",little traitor shoot desert sentinel 
26,"""O no;"" said Eric, ""it's all serene; Rowley's out, and dear old Rose'd never dream of supposing us elsewhere than in the arms of Morpheus. Besides the fellows are making less row now.""",say serene dear old dream suppose arm fellow make less row 
27,"""Well! look here! let's go and look on, and I'll tell you a dodge; put one of the tin washing-basins against the iron door of the lavatory, and then if any one comes he'll make clang enough to wake dead; and while he's amusing himself with this, there'll be lots of time to 'extinguish the superfluous abundance of the nocturnal illuminators.' Eh?""",look let go look tell dodge put tin washing basin iron door lavatory one come make clang wake dead amusing be lot time extinguish superfluous abundance nocturnal illuminator 
28,"""Capital!"" said Eric, ""come along.""",capital say come 
29,"They went down and arranged the signal very artistically, leaving the iron door ajar a little, and then neatly poising the large tin basin on its edge, so as to lean against it. Having extremely enjoyed this part of the proceeding, they went to look at the theatricals again, the boys being highly delighted at Upton's appearance among them.",go arrange signal leave iron door little poise large tin basin edge lean enjoy part proceeding go look theatrical boy delight appearance 
30,"They at once made Eric take a part in some very distant reminiscences of Macbeth, and corked his cheeks with whiskers and mustachios to make him resemble Banquo, his costume being completed by a girdle round his nightshirt, consisting of a very fine crimson silk handkerchief, richly broidered with gold, which had been brought to him from India, and which at first, in the innocence of his heart, he used to wear on Sundays, until he acquired the sobriquet of ""the Dragon."" Duncan made a superb Macbeth.",make take part distant reminiscence cork cheek whisker mustachios make resemble costume complete girdle nightshirt consist fine crimson silk handkerchief broider gold bring first innocence heart use wear acquire sobriquet make superb 
31,"They were doing the dagger-scene, which was put on the stage in a most novel manner. A sheet had been pinned from the top of the room, on one side of which stood a boy with a broken dinner knife, the handle end of which he was pushing through a hole in the middle of the sheet at the shadow of Duncan on the other side.",do dagger scene put stage novel manner sheet pinn top room side stand boy break dinner knife handle end push hole middle sheet shadow other side 
32,"Duncan himself, in an attitude of intensely affected melodrama, was spouting--",attitude affect melodrama spout 
33,"     ""Is this a dagger which I see before me?      The handle towards me now? come, let me clutch thee;""",dagger see handle come let clutch 
34,"And he snatched convulsively at the handle of the protruded knife; but as soon as he nearly touched it, this end was immediately withdrawn, and the blade end substituted, which made the comic Macbeth instantly draw back again, and recommence his apostrophe. This scene had tickled the audience immensely, and Duncan, amid shouts of laughter, was just drawing the somewhat unwarrantable conclusion that it was",snatch handle protrude knife touch end withdraw blade end substitute make comic draw recommence apostrophe scene tickle audience shout laughter draw unwarrantable conclusion 
35,"     ""A dagger of the mind, a false creation,""",dagger mind false creation 
36,"when a sudden grating, followed by a reverbrated clang, produced a dead silence.",sudden grating follow reverbrate clang produce dead silence 
37,"""Cavè,"" shouted Eric, and took a flying leap into his bed. Instantly there was a bolt in different directions; the sheet was torn down, the candles dashed out, the beds shoved aside, and the dormitories at once plunged in profound silence, only broken by the heavy breathing of sleepers, when in strode--not Mr. Rose or any of the under masters--but--Dr. Rowlands himself!",cavè shout take fly leap bed be bolt different direction sheet tear candle dash bed shove dormitory plunge profound silence break heavy breathing sleeper strode under master 
38,"He stood for a moment to survey the scene. All the dormitory doors were wide open; the sheet which had formed the stage curtain lay torn on the floor of No. 7; the beds in all the adjoining rooms were in the strangest positions; and half-extinguished wicks still smouldered in several of the sconces. Every boy was in bed, but the extraordinary way in which the bed clothes were huddled about told an unmistakeable tale.",stand moment survey scene dormitory door wide open sheet form stage curtain lay tear floor no. bed adjoin room strangest position half extinguish wick smoulder several sconce boy bed extraordinary way bed clothes huddle tell unmistakeable tale 
39,"He glanced quickly round, but the moment he had passed into No. 8, he heard a run, and, turning, just caught sight of Upton's figure vanishing into the darkness of the lavatory, towards the study stairs.",glance moment pass no. hear run turn catch sight figure vanish darkness lavatory study stair 
40,"He said not a word, but stalked hastily through all dormitories, again stopping at No. 7 on his return.",say word stalked dormitory stop no. return 
41,"He heard nothing but the deep snores of Duncan, and instantly fixed on him as a chief culprit.",hear deep snore fix chief culprit 
42,"""Duncan!""",
43,No reply; but calm stertorous music from Duncan's bed.,reply calm stertorous music bed 
44,"""Duncan!"" he said, still louder and more sternly, ""you sleep soundly, sir, too soundly; get up directly,"" and he laid his hand on the boy's arm.",say louder sleep sir get lay hand boy arm 
45,"""Get away, you old donkey,"" said Duncan sleepily; ""'t, aint time to get up yet. First bell hasn't rung.""",get old donkey say time get first bell rung 
46,"""Come, sir, this shamming will only increase your punishment;"" but the imperturbable Duncan stretched himself lazily, gave a great yawn, and then awoke with such an admirably feigned start at seeing Dr. Rowlands, that Eric, who had been peeping at the scene from over his bed-clothes, burst into an irresistible explosion of laughter.",come sir shamming increase punishment imperturbable stretch give great yawn awoke feign start see peep scene bed clothes burst irresistible explosion laughter 
47,"Dr. Rowlands swung round on his heel--""What! Williams! get out of bed, sir, this instant.""",swing heel get bed sir instant 
48,"Eric, forgetful of his disguise, sheepishly obeyed; but when he stood on the floor, he looked so odd in his crimson girdle and corked cheeks, with Dr. Rowlands surveying him in intense astonishment, that the scene became overpoweringly ludicrous to Duncan, who now in his turn was convulsed with a storm of laughter, faintly echoed in stifled titterings from other beds.",forgetful disguise obey stand floor look odd crimson girdle cork cheek survey intense astonishment scene become ludicrous turn convulse storm laughter echoe stifle tittering other bed 
49,"""_Very_ good,"" said Dr. Rowlands, now thoroughly angry, ""you will hear of this to-morrow;"" and he walked away with a heavy step, stopping at the lavatory door to restore the tin basin to its proper place, and then mounting to the studies.",good say angry hear walk heavy step stop lavatory door restore tin basin proper place mount study 
50,"Standing in the passage into which the studies opened, he knocked at one of the doors, and told a boy to summon all their occupants at once to the library.",stand passage study open knock door tell boy summon occupant library 
51,"Meanwhile, the dormitory-boys were aghast, and as soon as they heard the doctor's retreating footsteps, began flocking in the dark to No. 7, not daring to relight their candles.",dormitory boy aghast hear doctor retreating footstep begin flock dark no. dare relight candle 
52,"""Good gracious!"" said Attlay, ""only to think of Rowley appearing! How could he have twigged?""",good gracious say think appear twigg

56,"""Just like your mean chaff,"" retorted Duncan. ""But I say, Williams,"" he continued, laughing, ""you _did_ look so funny in the whiskers.""",mean chaff retort say continue laugh look funny whisker 
57,"At this juncture they heard all the study-boys running down stairs to the library, and, lost in conjecture, retired to their different rooms.",juncture hear study boy run stair library lose conjecture retire different room 
58,"""What do you think he'll do to us?"" asked Eric.",think do ask 
59,"""I don't know,"" said Duncan uneasily; ""flog us, for one thing, that's certain. I'm so sorry about that basin, Eric; but it's no good fretting. We've had our cake, and now we must pay for it, that's all.""",know say flog thing certain sorry basin good fretting have cake pay 
60,"Eric's cogitations began to be unpleasant, when the door opened, and somebody stole noiselessly in.",cogitation begin unpleasant door open steal 
61,"""Who's there?""",
62,"""Upton. I've come to have a chat. The Doctor's like a turkey-cock in sight of a red handkerchief. Never saw him in such a rage.""",come have chat turkey cock sight red handkerchief see rage 
63,"""Why, what's he been saying?"" asked Eric, as Upton came and took a seat on his bed.",say ask come take seat bed 
64,"""Oh! he's been rowing us like six o'clock,"" said Upton, ""about 'moral responsibility,' 'abetting the follies of children,' 'forgetting our position in the school,' and I don't know what all; and he ended by asking who'd been in the dormitories. Of course I confessed the soft impeachment, whereon he snorted 'Ha! I suspected so. Very well, Sir, you don't know how to use a study; you shall be deprived of it till the end of term.'""",row o'clock say moral responsibility abet follie child forget position school know end ask dormitory course confess soft impeachment snort suspect know use study deprive end term

66,"""Bosh! My dear fellow,"" said Upton, ""it's twice as much my fault as yours; and, after all, it was only a bit of fun. It's rather a bore losing the study, certainly; but never mind, we shall see all the more of each other. Good night; I must be off.""",dear fellow say much fault bit fun bore lose study mind see more other good night 
67,"Next morning, prayers were no sooner over than Dr. Rowlands said to the boys, ""Stop! I have a word to say to you.""",next morning prayer say boy stop have word say 
68,"""I find that there was the utmost disorder in the dormitories yesterday evening. All the candles were relighted at forbidden hours, and the noise made was so great that it was heard through the whole building. I am grieved that I cannot leave you, even for a few hours, without your taking such advantage of my absence; and that the upper boys, so far from using their influence to prevent these infractions of discipline, seem inclined rather to join in them themselves. On this occasion I have punished Upton, by depriving him of a privilege which he has abused; and as I myself detected Duncan and Williams, they will be flogged in the library at twelve. But I now come to the worst part of the proceeding. Somebody had been reckless enough to try and prevent surprise by the dangerous expedient of putting a tin basin against the iron door. The consequence was, that I was severely hurt, and _might_ have been seriously injured in entering the lavatory. I must know the name of the delinquent.""",find be utmost disorder dormitory yesterday evening candle relight forbidden hour noise make great hear whole building grieve leave few hour take such advantage absence upper boy use influence prevent infraction discipline seem inclined join occasion punish deprive privilege abuse detect flogge library come bad part proceeding reckless try prevent surprise dangerous expedient put tin basin iron door consequence hurt injure enter lavatory know name delinquent 
69,"Upton and Eric immediately stood up. Dr. Rowlands looked surprised, and there was an expression of grieved interest in Mr. Rose's face.",stand look surprise be expression grieve interest face 
70,"""Very well,"" said the Doctor, ""I shall speak to you both privately.""",say speak 
71,"Twelve o'clock came, and Duncan and Eric received a severe caning. Corporal punishment, however necessary and desirable for some dispositions, always produced on Eric the worst effects. He burned, not with remorse or regret, but with shame and violent indignation, and listened, with a glare in his eye, to Dr. Rowlands' warnings. When the flogging was over, he almost rushed out of the room, to choke in solitude his sense of humiliation, nor would he suffer any one for an instant to allude to his disgrace. Dr. Rowlands had hinted that Upton was doing him no good; but he passionately resented the suggestion, and determined, with obstinate perversity, to cling more than ever to the boy whom he had helped to involve in the same trouble with himself.",o'clock come receive severe caning corporal punishment necessary desirable disposition produce bad effect burn remorse regret shame violent indignation listen glare eye warning flog rush room choke solitude sense humiliation suffer one instant allude disgrace hint do good resent suggestion determine obstinate perversity cling more boy help involve same trouble 
72,"Any attempt on the part of masters to interfere in the friendships of boys is usually unsuccessful. The boy who has been warned against his new acquaintance not seldom repeats to him the fact that Mr. So-and-so doesn't like seeing them together, and after that they fancy themselves bound in honor to show that they are not afraid of continuing their connection. It was not strange, therefore, that Eric and Upton were thrown more than ever into each other's society, and consequently, that Eric, while he improved daily in strength, activity, and prowess, neglected more and more his school duties and honorable ambitions.",attempt part master interfere friendship boy unsuccessful boy warn new acquaintance repeat fact like see fancy bind honor show afraid continue connection strange throw more other society improve strength activity prowess neglect more more school duty honorable ambition 
73,"Mr. Rose sadly remarked the failure of promise in his character and abilities, and did all that could be done, by gentle firmness and unwavering kindness, to recal his pupil to a sense of duty. One night he sent for him to supper, and invited no one else. During the evening he drew out Eric's exercise, and compared it with, those of Russell and Owen, who were now getting easily ahead of him in marks. Eric's was careless, hurried, and untidy; the other two were neat, spirited, and painstaking, and had, therefore, been marked much higher.",remark failure promise character ability do do gentle firmness unwavering kindness recal pupil sense duty night send supper invite else evening draw exercise compare get mark careless hurry untidy other neat spirit painstake mark high

75,Eric was silent.,silent 
76,"Mr. Rose laid his hand gently on his head. ""I fear, my boy, you have not been improving lately. You have got into many scrapes, and are letting boys beat you in form who are far your inferiors in ability. That is a very bad _sign_, Eric; in itself it is a discouraging fact, but I fear it indicates worse evils. You are wasting the golden hours, my boy, that can never return. I only hope and trust that no other change for the worse is going on in your character.""",lay hand head fear boy improve get many scrape let boy beat form inferior ability bad _sign_ discouraging fact fear indicate bad evil waste golden hour boy return hope trust other change bad go character 
77,"And so he talked on till the boy's sorrow was undisguised. ""Come,"" he said gently, ""let us kneel down together before we part.""",talk boy sorrow undisguised come say let kneel part 
78,"Boy and master knelt down humbly side by side, and, from a full heart, the young man poured out his fervent petitions for the child beside him. Eric's heart seemed to catch a glow from his words, and he loved him as a brother. He rose from his knees full of the strongest resolutions, and earnestly promised amendment for the future.",boy master knolt side side full heart young man pour fervent petition child heart seem catch glow word love brother rise knee full strong resolution promise amendment future 
79,"But poor Eric did not yet know his own infirmity. For a time, indeed, there was a marked improvement; but daily life flowed on with its usual allurements, and when the hours of temptation came, his good intentions melted away, so that, in a few more weeks, the prayer, and the vows that followed it, had been obliterated from his memory without leaving any traces in his life.",poor know own infirmity time be mark improvement daily life flow usual allurement hour temptation come good intention melt few more week prayer vow follow obliterate memory leave trace life
