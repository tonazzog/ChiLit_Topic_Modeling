1,"CHAPTER XXIII. CISSY CARTER, BOYS' GIRL.",boy girl 
2," Now Prissy Smith was a girls' girl, while Cissy Carter was a boys' girl. That was mainly the difference between them. Not that Prissy did not love boys' play upon occasion, for which indeed her fleetness of foot particularly fitted her. Also if Hugh John teased her she never cried nor told on him, but waited till he was looking the other way and then gave him something for himself on the ear. But on the whole she was a girls' girl, and her idea of the way to fight was slapping her dolls when they were naughty.",girl girl boy girl difference love boy play occasion fleetness foot fit tease cry tell wait look other way give ear whole girl girl idea way fight slap doll naughty 
3,"Now, Mr. Picton Smith said that most religion was summed up in two maxims, ""Don't tell lies,"" and ""Don't tell tales."" To these Hugh John added a third, at least equal in canonicity, ""Don't be dasht-mean."" In these you have briefly comprehended all the Law and the Prophets of the house of Windy Standard.",say most religion sum maxim tell lie tell tale add third least equal canonicity dasht mean comprehend house windy 
4,"Cissy Carter, however, was a tom-boy: you could not get over that. There was no other word for her. She never played with girls if she could better herself. She despised dolls; she hated botany and the piano. Her governess had a hard but lively time of it, and had it not been for her brother Sammy coaching her in short cuts to knowledge, she would have been left far behind in the exact sciences of spelling and the multiplication-table. As it was, between a tendency to scramble for scraps of information and the run of a pretty wide library, Cissy knew more than any one gave her credit for.",tom boy get be other word play girl despise doll hate botany piano governess have hard lively time brother coach short cut knowledge leave exact science spelling multiplication table tendency scramble scrap information run wide library know more one give credit 
5,"On one memorable occasion it was Cissy's duty to take her grandmother for a walk. Now the Dowager Mrs. Davenant Carter was the dearest and most fairy-like old lady in the world, and Cissy was very proud to walk into Edam with her. For her grandmother had not forgotten how good confections tasted to girls of thirteen, and there was quite a nice shop in the High Street. Their rose-drops especially were almost as good as doing-what-you-were-told-not-to, and their peppermints for use in church had quite the force of a religious observance.",memorable occasion duty take grandmother walk dearest fairy like old lady world proud walk grandmother forget good confection taste girl be nice shop high rose drop good do tell peppermint use church have force religious observance 
6,"But Mrs. Davenant Carter had a weak eye, and whenever she went out, she put a large green shade over it. So one day it happened that Cissy was walking abroad with her grandmother, with a vision of rose-drop-shop in the offing. As they were passing one of the villas nearest to their house, a certain rude boy, Wedgwood Baker the name of him, seeing the lame old lady tripping by on her stick like a fairy godmother, called out loudly ""Go it, old blind patch!""",have weak eye go put large green shade day happen walk grandmother vision rose drop shop offing pass villa near house certain rude boy name see lame old lady trip stick fairy godmother call go old blind patch 
7,"He was sorry the minute after, for in one moment Cissy Carter had pulled off her white thread gloves, climbed the fence, and had landed what Hugh John would have called ""One, two, three--and a tiger"" upon the person of Master Wedgwood Baker.",sorry minute moment pull white thread glove climb fence land call tiger person 
8,"I do not say that all Cissy Carter's blows were strictly according to Queensberry rules. But at any rate the ungallant youth was promptly doubled up, and retreated yelling into the house, as it were falling back upon his reserves.",say blow accord rule rate ungallant youth double retreat yell house fall reserve 
9,"That same evening the card of Mrs. Baker, Laurel Villa, Edam, was brought to the diningtable of Mrs. Davenant Carter.",same evening card bring diningtable 
10,"""The lady declines to come in, m'am. She says she must see you immediately at the door,"" said the scandalised housemaid.",lady decline come say see door say scandalise housemaid 
11,"Cissy's mother went into the hall with the card in her hand, and a look of gentle surprised inquiry on her face. There, on the doorstep was Mrs. Baker, with a young and hopeful but sadly damaged Wedgwood tagging behind her, like a weak-minded punt in tow of an ancient threedecker.",mother go hall card hand look gentle surprise inquiry face doorstep young hopeful damage tagg weak minded punt tow ancient threedecker

14,"""Look at him, madam. That is the handiwork of your daughter. The poor boy was quietly digging in the garden, cultivating a few unpretending flowers, when your daughter, madam, suddenly flew at him over the railings and struck him on the face so furiously that, if I had not come to the rescue, the dear boy might have lost the use of both his eyes. But most happily I heard the disturbance and went out and stopped her.""",look madam handiwork daughter poor boy digg garden cultivate few unpretending flower daughter madam fly railing strike face come rescue dear boy lose use eye hear disturbance go stop

16,"""Mistake! No, indeed, madam, there is no mistake, I saw her with my own eyes--a great girl twice Wedgwood's size.""",mistake madam be mistake see own eye great girl size 
17,At this point Mr. Davenant Carter came to the door with his table-napkin in his hand.,point come door table napkin hand 
18,"""What's this--what's this?"" he demanded in his quick way--""Cissy and your son been fighting?""",demand quick way son fight 
19,"""No indeed, sir,"" said the complainant indignantly; ""this dear boy never so much as lifted a hand to her. Ah, here she comes--the very--ahem, young lady herself.""",sir say complainant dear boy lift hand come very young lady 
20,"All ignorant of the trouble in store for her, Cissy came whistling through the laurels with half-a-dozen dogs at her heels. At sight of her Mrs. Baker bridled and perked her chin with indignation till all her black bugles clashed and twinkled.",ignorant trouble store come whistle laurel half dog heel sight bridl perk chin indignation black bugle clash twinkle

22,"""Yes, I did,"" quoth the undaunted Cissy, ""and what's more, I'll do it again, and give him twice as much, if he ever dares to call _my_ grandmother 'Old Blind Patch' again--I don't care if he is two years and three months older than me!""",do undaunted more do give much dare call grandmother old blind care year month old

28,"""Oh, you little liar! Wait till I catch you out!"" said Cissy, going a step nearer as if she would like to begin again. ""I'll teach you to tell lies on me.""",little liar wait catch say go step like begin teach tell lie 
29,"Mrs. Baker of Laurel Villa held up her hands so that the lace mitts came together like the fingers of a figure of grief upon a tomb. ""What a dreadful girl!"" she said, looking up as if to ask Heaven to support her.",hold hand lace mitt come finger figure grief tomb dreadful girl say look ask support 
30,Mr. Davenant Carter remembered his position as a county magistrate. Also he desired to stand well with all his neighbours.,remember position county magistrate desire stand neighbour 
31,"""Madam,"" he said to Mrs. Baker, in the impressive tone in which he addressed public meetings, ""I regret exceedingly that you should have been put to this trouble. I think that for the future you will have no reason to complain of my daughter. Will you allow me to conduct you across the policies by the shorter way? Cissy, go to bed _at once_, and stop there till I bid you get up! That will teach you to take the law into you own hands when your father is a Justice of the Peace!""",say impressive tone address public meeting regret put trouble think future have reason complain daughter allow conduct policy short way go bed once_ stop bid get teach take law own hand father 
32,"This he said in such a stern voice that Mrs. Baker was much flattered and quite appeased. He walked with the lady to the small gate in the boundary wall, opened it with his private key, and last of all shook hands with his visitor with the most distinguished courtesy. Some day he meant to stand for the burgh and her brothers were well-to-do grocers in the town.",say stern voice flattered appease walk lady small gate boundary wall open private key last shake hand visitor distinguished courtesy day mean stand burgh brother do grocer town

35,"""It shows what a humbug pa is,"" muttered Cissy, as she went upstairs; ""he knows very well it is bed-time anyway. I don't believe he is angry one bit!""",show humbug pa mutter go know bed time believe angry bit 
36,"When her father came in, he looked over at his wife. I am afraid he deliberately winked, though in the interests of morality I trust I may be mistaken. For how could a Justice of the Peace and a future Member of Parliament demean himself to wink?",father come look wife afraid wink interest morality trust mistaken future demean wink 
37,"""Jane,"" he said to Mrs. Carter, ""what does Cissy like most of all for supper?""",say like most supper
