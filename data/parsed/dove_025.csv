2," THE clear sunshine of early summer was becoming low on the hillsides. Sparkling and dimpling, the clear amber-coloured stream of the Braunwasser rippled along its stony bed, winding in and out among the rocks so humbly that it seemed to be mocked by the wide span of the arch that crossed it in all the might of massive bulwarks, and dignified masonry of huge stones.",clear sunshine early summer become low hillside sparkle dimple clear amber coloured stream ripple stony bed wind rock seem mock wide span arch cross might massive bulwark dignified masonry huge stone 
3,"Some way above, a clearing of the wood below the mountain showed huts, and labourers apparently constructing a mill so as to take advantage of the leap of the water from the height above; and, on the left bank, an enclosure was traced out, within which were rising the walls of a small church, while the noise of the mallet and chisel echoed back from the mountain side, and masons, white with stone-dust, swarmed around.",way clear wood mountain show hut labourer construct mill take advantage leap water height left bank enclosure trace rise wall small church noise mallet chisel echoe mountain side mason white stone dust swarm 
4,"Across the bridge came a pilgrim, marked out as such by hat, wallet, and long staff, on which he leant heavily, stumbling along as if both halting and footsore, and bending as one bowed down by past toil and present fatigue.  Pausing in the centre, he gazed round with a strange disconcerted air—at the castle on the terraced hillside, looking down with bright eyes of glass glittering in the sunshine, and lighting up even that grim old pile; at the banner hanging so lazily that the tinctures and bearings were hidden in the folds; then at the crags, rosy purple in evening glow, rising in broad step above step up to the Red Eyrie, bathed in sunset majesty of dark crimson; and above it the sweep of the descending eagle, discernible for a moment in the pearly light of the sky.  The pilgrim’s eye lighted up as he watched it; but then, looking down at bridge, and church, and trodden wheel-tracked path, he frowned with perplexity, and each painful step grew heavier and more uncertain.",bridge come pilgrim mark such hat wallet long staff lean stumble halt footsore bending bow past toil present fatigue pause centre gaze strange disconcert air castle terrace hillside look bright eye glass glitter sunshine light grim old pile banner hang tincture bearing hide fold crag rosy purple evening glow rise broad step step red bath sunset majesty dark crimson sweep descend eagle discernible moment pearly light sky pilgrim eye light watch look bridge church trodd wheel track path frown perplexity painful step grow heavy uncertain 
5,"Near the opposite side of the enclosure there waited a tall, rugged-looking, elderly man with two horses—one an aged mare, mane, tail, and all of the snowiest silvery white; the other a little shaggy dark mountain pony, with a pad-saddle.  And close to the bank of the stream might be seen its owner, a little girl of some seven years, whose tight round lace cap had slipped back, as well as her blue silk hood, and exposed a profusion of loose flaxen hair, and a plump, innocent face, intent upon some private little bit of building of her own with some pebbles from the brook, and some mortar filched from the operations above, to the great detriment of her soft pinky fingers.",opposite side enclosure wait tall rugged look elderly man horse aged mare mane tail snowiest silvery white other little shaggy dark mountain pony pad saddle bank stream see owner little girl year tight round lace cap slip blue silk hood expose profusion loose flaxen hair plump innocent face intent private little bit building own pebble brook mortar filch operation great detriment soft pinky finger 
6,"The pilgrim looked at her unperceived, and for a moment was about to address her; but then, with a strange air of repulsion, dragged himself on to the porch of the rising church, where, seated on a block of stone, he could look into the interior.  All was unfinished, but the portion which had made the most progress was a chantry-chapel opposite to the porch, and containing what were evidently designed to be two monuments. One was merely blocked out, but it showed the outline of a warrior, bearing a shield on which a coiled serpent was rudely sketched in red chalk.  The other, in a much more forward state, was actually under the hands of the sculptor, and represented a slender youth, almost a boy, though in the full armour of a knight, his hands clasped on his breast over a lute, an eagle on his shield, an eagle-crest on his helmet, and, under the arcade supporting the altar-tomb, shields alternately of eagles and doves.",pilgrim look unperceived moment about address strange air repulsion drag porch rise church seat block stone look interior unfinished portion make most progress chantry chapel porch contain design monument block show outline warrior bear shield coiled serpent sketch red chalk other forward state hand sculptor represent slender youth boy full armour knight hand clasp breast lute eagle shield eagle crest helmet arcade support altar tomb shield eagle dove 
7,"But the strangest thing was that this young knight seemed to be sitting for his own effigy.  The very same face, under the very same helmet, only with the varied, warm hues of life, instead of in cold white marble, was to be seen on the shoulders of a young man in a gray cloth dress, with a black scarf passing from shoulder to waist, crossed by a sword-belt.  The hair was hidden by the helmet, whose raised visor showed keen, finely-cut features, and a pair of dark brown eyes, of somewhat grave and sad expression.",strangest thing young knight seem sit own effigy same face same helmet varied warm hue life cold white marble see shoulder young man gray cloth dress black scarf pass shoulder waist cross sword belt hair hide helmet raise visor show keen cut feature pair dark brown eye grave sad expression 
8,"“Have a care, Lucas,” he presently said; “I fear me you are chiselling away too much.  It must be a softer, more rounded face than mine has become; and, above all, let it not catch any saddened look.  Keep that air of solemn waiting in glad hope, as though he saw the dawn through his closed eyelids, and were about to take up his song again!”",have care say fear chisell much softer round face become let catch sadden look keep air solemn waiting glad hope see dawn close eyelid about take song

If I cannot get letters from the Kaisar, I shall go in search of him, that he may see that my lameness is no more an impediment.”",well last sitting set week get letter go search see lameness impediment 
11,"The pilgrim passed his hand over his face, as though to dissipate a bewildering dream; and just then the little girl, all flushed and dabbled, flew rushing up from the stream, but came to a sudden standstill at sight of the stranger, who at length addressed her.  “Little lady,” he said, “is this the Debateable Ford?”",pilgrim pass hand face dissipate bewildering dream little girl flush dabble fly rush stream come sudden standstill sight stranger length address little lady say debateable

13,"The pilgrim started, as with a pang of recollection.  “And what is yonder castle?” he further asked.",pilgrim start pang recollection yonder castle ask 
14,"“Schloss Adlerstein,” she said, proudly.",say 
15,“And you are the little lady of Adlerstein Wildschloss?”,little lady 
16,"“Yes,” again she answered; and then, gathering courage—“You are a holy pilgrim!  Come up to the castle for supper and rest.”  And then, springing past him, she flew up to the knight, crying, “Herr Freiherr, here is a holy pilgrim, weary and hungry.  Let us take him home to the mother.”",answer gather courage holy pilgrim come castle supper rest spring fly knight cry holy pilgrim weary hungry let take mother 
17,"“Did he take thee for a wild elf?” said the young man, with an elder-brotherly endeavour to right the little cap that had slidden under the chin, and to push back the unmanageable wealth of hair under it, ere he rose; and he came forward and spoke with kind courtesy, as he observed the wanderer’s worn air and feeble step.  “Dost need a night’s lodging, holy palmer?  My mother will make thee welcome, if thou canst climb as high as the castle yonder.”",take wild elf say young man elder brotherly endeavour right little cap slidd chin push unmanageable wealth hair rise come speak kind courtesy observe wanderer wear air feeble step need night lodging holy palmer mother make welcome climb high castle yonder 
18,"The pilgrim made an obeisance, but, instead of answering, demanded hastily, “See I yonder the bearing of Schlangenwald?”",pilgrim make obeisance answer demand yonder bear 
19,"“Even so.  Schloss Schlangenwald is about a league further on, and thou wilt find a kind reception there, if thither thou art bent.”",league find kind reception art bend

21,“He fell in a skirmish.”,fall skirmish 
22,“By whose hand?”,hand 
23,“By mine.”,
24,"“Ha!” and the pilgrim surveyed him with undisguised astonishment; then, without another word, took up his staff and limped out of the building, but not on the road to Schlangenwald.  It was nearly a quarter of an hour afterwards that he was overtaken by the young knight and the little lady on their horses, just where the new road to the castle parted from the old way by the Eagle’s Ladder.  The knight reined up as he saw the poor man’s slow, painful steps, and said, “So thou art not bound for Schlangenwald?”",pilgrim survey undisguised astonishment word take staff limp building road quarter hour overtake young knight little lady horse new road castle part old way knight rein see poor man slow painful step say art bind

26,"“Nay, at this rate thou wilt not be there till midnight,” said the young knight, springing off his horse; “thou canst never brook our sharp stones!  See, Thekla, do thou ride on with Heinz to tell the mother I am bringing her a holy pilgrim to tend.  And thou, good man, mount my old gray.  Fear not; she is steady and sure-footed, and hath of late been used to a lame rider.  Ah! that is well.  Thou hast been in the saddle before.”",rate midnight say young knight spring horse briok sharp stone see ride tell mother bring holy pilgrim tend good man mount old gray fear steady sure footed have use lame rider well saddle 
27,"To go afoot for the sake of giving a lift to a holy wayfarer was one of the most esteemed acts of piety of the Middle Age, so that no one durst object to it, and the palmer did no more than utter a suppressed murmur of acknowledgment as he seated himself on horseback, the young knight walking by his rein.  “But what is this?” he exclaimed, almost with dismay.  “A road to the castle up here!”",go afoot sake give lift holy wayfarer esteemed act piety middle durst object palmer do more utter suppress murmur acknowledgment seat horseback young knight walk rein exclaim dismay road castle

30,“What!—of my grandfather!” was the exclamation.,grandfather exclamation 
31,“No!” gruffly.  “Of old Freiherr Eberhard.  Not of any of the Wildschloss crew.”,old crew 
32,"“But I am not a Wildschloss!  I am grandson to Freiherr Eberhard!  Oh, wast thou with him and my father when they were set upon in the hostel?” he cried, looking eagerly up to the pilgrim; but the man kept his broad-leaved hat slouched over his face, and only muttered, “The son of Christina!” the last word so low that Ebbo was not sure that he caught it, and the next moment the old warrior exclaimed exultingly, “And you have had vengeance on them!  When—how—where?”",grandson father set hostel cry look pilgrim man keep broad leaved hat slouch face mutter son last word low sure catch next moment old warrior exclaim have vengeance 
33,"“Last harvest-tide—at the Debateable Strand,” said Ebbo, never able to speak of the encounter without a weight at his heart, but drawn on by the earnestness of the old foe of Schlangenwald.  “It was a meeting in full career—lances broken, sword-stroke on either hand.  I was sore wounded, but my sword went through his collar-bone.”",last harvest tide debateable say able speak encounter weight heart draw earnestness old foe meeting full career lance break sword stroke hand sore wound sword go collar bone 
34,"“Well struck! good stroke!” cried the pilgrim, in rapture.  “And with that sword?”",strike good stroke cry pilgrim rapture sword 
35,"“With this sword.  Didst know it?” said Ebbo, drawing the weapon, and giving it to the old man, who held it for a few moments, weighed it affectionately, and with a long low sigh restored it, saying, “It is well.  You and that blade have paid off the score.  I should be content. Let me dismount.  I know my way to the hermitage.”",sword know say draw weapon give old man hold few moment weigh long low sigh restore say well blade pay score content let dismount know way hermitage

39,"“Not when his wife has taken a new lord,” growled the stranger, bitterly, “and he a Wildschloss!  Young man, I could have pardoned aught else!”",wife take new lord growl stranger young man pardon aught else 
40,"“I know not who you may be who talk of pardoning my lady-mother,” said Ebbo, “but new lord she has neither taken nor will take.  She has refused every offer; and, now that Schlangenwald with his last breath confessed that he slew not my father, but sold him to the Turks, I have been only awaiting recovery from my wound to go in search of him.”",know talk pardon lady mother say new lord take take refuse offer last breath confess slew father sell await recovery wound go search 
41,"“Who then is yonder child, who told me she was Wildschloss?”",child tell 
42,"“That child,” said Ebbo, with half a smile and half a blush, “is my wife, the daughter of Wildschloss, who prayed me to espouse her thus early, that so my mother might bring her up.”",child say smile blush wife daughter pray espouse mother bring 
43,"By this time they had reached the castle court, now a well-kept, lordly-looking enclosure, where the pilgrim looked about him as one bewildered.  He was so infirm that Ebbo carefully helped him up the stone stairs to the hall, where he already saw his mother prepared for the hospitable reception of the palmer.  Leaving him at the entrance, Ebbo crossed the hall to say to her in a low voice, “This pilgrim is one of the old lanzknechts of my grandfather’s time.  I wonder whether you or Heinz will know him.  One of the old sort—supremely discontented at change.”",time reach castle court keep look enclosure pilgrim look bewilder infirm help stone stair hall see mother prepare hospitable reception palmer leave entrance cross hall say low voice pilgrim old lanzknecht grandfather time wonder know old sort discontent change 
44,"“And thou hast walked up, and wearied thyself!” exclaimed Christina, grieved to see her son’s halting step.",hast walk weary exclaim grieve see son halt step 
45,"“A rest will soon cure that,” said Ebbo, seating himself as he spoke on a settle near the hall fire; but the next moment a strange wild low shriek from his mother made him start up and spring to her side.  She stood with hands clasped, and wondering eyes.  The pilgrim—his hat on the ground, his white head and rugged face displayed—was gazing as though devouring her with his eyes, murmuring, “Unchanged! unchanged!”",rest cure say seating speak settle hall fire next moment strange wild low shriek mother make start spring side stand hand clasp wonder eye pilgrim hat ground white head rugged face display gaze devour eye murmure unchange unchanged 
46,“What is this!” thundered the young Baron.  “What are you doing to the lady?”,thunder young do lady 
47,"“Hush! hush, Ebbo!” exclaimed Christina.  “It is thy father!  On thy knees!  Thy father is come!  It is our son, my own lord.  Oh, embrace him!  Kneel to him, Ebbo!” she wildly cried.",exclaim father knee father come son own lord embrace kneel cry 
48,"“Hold, mother,” said Ebbo, keeping his arm round her, though she struggled against him, for he felt some doubts as he looked back at his walk with the stranger, and remembered Heinz’s want of recognition.  “Is it certain that this is indeed my father?”",hold mother say keep arm struggle feel doubt look walk stranger remember want recognition certain father 
49,"“Oh, Ebbo,” was the cry of poor Christina, almost beside herself, “how could I not be sure?  I know him!  I feel it!  Oh, my lord, bear with him.  It is his wont to be so loving!  Ebbo, cannot you see it is himself?”",cry poor sure know feel lord bear loving see 
50,"“The young fellow is right,” said the stranger, slowly.  “I will answer all he may demand.”",young fellow right say stranger answer demand 
51,"“Forgive me,” said Ebbo, abashed, “forgive me;” and, as his mother broke from him, he fell upon his knee; but he only heard his father’s cry, “Ah! Stine, Stine, thou alone art the same,” and, looking up, saw her, with her face hidden in the white beard, quivering with a rapture such as he had never seen in her before.  It seemed long to him ere she looked up again in her husband’s face to sob on: “My son!  Oh! my beautiful twins! Our son!  Oh, see him, dear lord!”  And the pilgrim turned to hear Ebbo’s “Pardon, honoured father, and your blessing.”",forgive say abash forgive mother break fall knee hear father cry alone art same look see face hide white beard quiver rapture such see seem look husband face sob son beautiful twin son see dear lord pilgrim turn hear pardon honoure father blessing 
52,"Almost bashfully the pilgrim laid his hand on the dark head, and murmured something; then said, “Up, then!  The slayer of Schlangenwald kneeling! Ah!  Stine, I knew thy little head was wondrous wise, but I little thought thou wouldst breed him up to avenge us on old Wolfgang!  So slender a lad too!  Ha!  Schneiderlein, old rogue, I knew thee,” holding out his hand.  “So thou didst get home safe?”",pilgrim lay hand dark head murmure say slayer kneel know little head wondrous wise think breed avenge old slender lad old rogue know hold hand get safe 
53,"“Ay, my lord; though, if I left you alive, never more will I call a man dead,” said Heinz.",lord leave alive call man dead say 
54,"“Worse luck for me—till now,” said Sir Eberhard, whose tones, rather than his looks, carried perfect conviction of his identity.  It was the old homely accent, and gruff good-humoured voice, but with something subdued and broken in the tone.  His features had grown like his father’s, but he looked much older than ever the hale old mountaineer had done, or than his real age; so worn and lined was his face, his skin tanned, his eyelids and temples puckered by burning sun, his hair and beard white as the inane of his old mare, the proud Adlerstein port entirely gone.  He stooped even more without his staff than with it; and, when he yielded himself with a sigh of repose to his wife’s tendance, she found that he had not merely the ordinary hurts of travelling, but that there were old festering scars on his ankles.  “The gyves,” he said, as she looked up at him, with startled, pitying eyes.  “Little deemed I that they would ever come under thy tender hands.”  As he almost timidly smoothed the braid of dark hair on her brow—“So they never burnt thee for a witch after all, little one?  I thought my mother would never keep her hands off thee, and used to fancy I heard the crackling of the flame.”",bad luck say tone look carry perfect conviction identity old homely accent gruff good humoured voice subdued break tone feature grow father look old hale old mountaineer do real age wear line face skin tann eyelid temple pucker burn sun hair beard white inane old mare proud port gone stoop staff yield sigh repose wife tendance find ordinary hurt travel be old fester scar ankle gyve say look startle pity eye little deem come tender hand smooth braid dark hair brow burn witch little one think mother keep hand use fancy hear crackling flame 
55,"“She spared me for my children’s sake,” said Christina; “and truly Heaven has been very good to us, but never so much as now.  My dear lord, will it weary thee too much to come to the castle chapel and give thanks?” she said, timidly.",spare child sake say heaven good dear lord weary much come castle chapel give thanks say 
56,"“With all my heart,” he answered, earnestly.  “I would go even on my knees.  We were not without masses even in Tunis; but, when Italian and Spaniard would be ransomed, and there was no mind of the German, I little thought I should ever sing Brother Lambert’s psalm about turning our captivity as rivers in the south.”",heart answer go knee mass italian ransome be mind think sing psalm turn captivity river south 
57,"Ebbo was hovering round, supplying all that was needed for his father’s comfort; but his parents were so completely absorbed in one another that he was scarcely noticed, and, what perhaps pained him more, there was no word about Friedel.  He felt this almost an injustice to the brother who had been foremost in embracing the idea of the unknown father, and scarcely understood how his parents shrank from any sorrowful thought that might break in on their new-found joy, nor that he himself was so strange and new a being in his father’s eyes, that to imagine him doubled was hardly possible to the tardy, dulled capacity, which as yet seemed unable to feel anything but that here was home, and Christina.",hover supply need father comfort parent absorb notice pain be word feel injustice brother foremost embrace idea unknown father understand parent shrank sorrowful thought break new find joy strange new father eye imagine double possible tardy dull capacity seem unable feel home 
58,"When the chapel bell rang, and the pair rose to offer their thanksgiving, Ebbo dutifully offered his support, but was absolutely unseen, so fondly was Sir Eberhard leaning on his wife; and her bright exulting smile and shake of the head gave an absolute pang to the son who had hitherto been all in all to her.",chapel bell ring pair rise offer thanksgiving offer support unseen lean wife bright exult smile shake head give absolute pang son 
59,"He followed, and, as they passed Friedmund’s coffin, he thought his mother pointed to it, but even of this he was uncertain.  The pair knelt side by side with hands locked together, while notes of praise rose from all voices; and meantime Ebbo, close to that coffin, strove to share the joy, and to lift up a heart that _would_ sink in the midst of self-reproach for undutifulness, and would dislike the thought of the rude untaught man, holding aloof from him, likely to view him with distrust and jealousy, and to undo all he had achieved, and further absorbing the mother, the mother who was to him all the world, and for whose sake he had given his best years to the child-wife, as yet nothing to him.",follow pass coffin think mother point uncertain pair knolt side side hand lock note praise rise voice meantime close coffin strive share joy lift heart sink midst self reproach undutifulness dislike thought rude untaught man hold aloof likely view distrust jealousy undo achieve absorb mother mother world sake give good year child wife 
60,"It was reversing the natural order of things that, after reigning from infancy, he should have to give up at eighteen to one of the last generation; and some such thought rankled in his mind when the whole household trooped joyfully out of the chapel to prepare a banquet for their old new lord, and their young old lord was left alone.",reverse natural order thing reign infancy have give last generation such thought rankle mind whole household troop chapel prepare banquet old new lord young old lord leave alone 
61,"Alone with the coffin where the armour lay upon the white cross, Ebbo threw himself on his knees, and laid his head upon it, murmuring, “Ah, Friedel!  Friedel!  Would that we had changed places!  Thou wouldst brook it better.  At least thou didst never know what it is to be lonely.”",coffin armour lay white cross throw knee lay head murmure change place briok good least know lonely 
62,“Herr Baron!” said a little voice.,say little voice 
63,"His first movement was impatient.  Thekla was apt to pursue him wherever he did not want her; but here he had least expected her, for she had a great fear of that coffin, and could hardly be brought to the chapel at prayer times, when she generally occupied herself with fancies that the empty helmet glared at her.  But now Ebbo saw her standing as near as she durst, with a sweet wistfulness in her eyes, such as he had never seen there before.",first movement impatient apt pursue want least expect have great fear coffin bring chapel prayer time occupy fancy empty helmet glare see standing durst sweet wistfulness eye such see

68,"“But you have me!” cried Thekla; and, as he looked up between amusement and melancholy, he met such a loving eager little face, that he could not help holding out his arms, and letting her cling to him.  “Indeed,” she said, “I’ll never be afraid of the helmet again, if only you will not lay down your head there, and say you are alone.”",have cry look amusement melancholy meet loving eager little face help hold arm let cling say afraid helmet lay head say alone 
69,"“Never, Thekla! while you are my little wife,” said he; and, child as she was, there was strange solace to his heart in the eyes that, once vacant and wondering, had now gained a look of love and intelligence.",little wife say child be strange solace heart eye vacant wonder gain look love intelligence 
70,"“What are you going to do?” she said, shuddering a little, as he rose and laid his hand on Friedel’s sword.",go do say shudder little rise lay hand sword 
71,"“To make thee gird on thine own knight’s sword,” said Ebbo, unbuckling that which he had so long worn.  “Friedel,” he added, “thou wouldst give me thine.  Let me take up thy temper with it, thine open-hearted love and humility.”",make gird own knight sword say unbuckle have wear add give let take temper open hearted love humility

Remember, it is thy husband’s first secret.”",guide happy little finger fastening belt lay hand say speak say mother remember husband first secret 
73,"And feeling no longer solitary when his hand was in the clasp of hers, he returned to the hall, where his father was installed in the baronial chair, in which Ebbo had been at home from babyhood.  His mother’s exclamation showed that her son had been wanting to her; and she looked fuller than ever of bliss when Ebbo gravely stood before his father, and presented him with the good old sword that he had sent to his unborn son.",feel solitary hand clasp return hall father install baronial chair home babyhood mother exclamation show son want look fuller bliss stand father present good old sword send unborn son 
74,"“You are like to use it more than I,—nay, you have used it to some purpose,” said he.  “Yet must I keep mine old comrade at least a little while.  Wife, son, sword, should make one feel the same man again, but it is all too wonderful!”",use more use purpose say keep old comrade least little while wife son sword make feel same man wonderful 
75,"All that evening, and long after, his hand from time to time sought the hilt of his sword, as if that touch above all proved to him that he was again a free noble in his own castle.",evening hand time time seek hilt sword touch prove free noble own castle 
76,"The story he told was thus.  The swoon in which Heinz had left him had probably saved his life by checking the gush of blood, and he had known no more till he found himself in a rough cart among the corpses.  At Schlangenwald’s castle he had been found still breathing, and had been flung into a dungeon, where he lay unattended, for how long he never knew, since all the early part of the time was lost in the clouds of fever.  On coarse fare and scanty drink, in that dark vault, he had struggled by sheer obstinacy of vitality into recovery.  In the very height of midsummer alone did the sun peep through the grating of his cell, and he had newly hailed this cheerful visitor when he was roughly summoned, placed on horseback with eyes and hands bound, and only allowed sight again to find himself among a herd of his fellow Germans in the Turkish camp.  They were the prisoners of the terrible Turkish raid of 1475, when Georg von Schenk and fourteen other noblemen of Austria and Styria were all taken in one unhappy fight, and dragged away into captivity, with hundreds of lower rank.",story tell swoon leave save life check gush blood know more find rough cart corpse castle find breathe flung dungeon lay unattend know early part time lose cloud fever coarse fare scanty drink dark vault struggle sheer obstinacy vitality recovery very height sun peep grating cell hail cheerful visitor summon place horseback eye hand bind allow sight find herd fellow turkish camp prisoner terrible turkish raid other noblemen take unhappy fight drag captivity hundred low rank 
77,"To Sir Eberhard the change had been greatly for the better.  The Turk had treated him much better than the Christian; and walking in the open air, chained to a German comrade, was far pleasanter than pining in his lonely dungeon.  At Adrianople, an offer had been made to each of the captives, if they would become Moslems, of entering the Ottoman service as Spahis; but with one voice they had refused, and had then been draughted into different divisions.  The fifteen nobles, who had been offered for ransom, were taken to Constantinople, to await its arrival, and they had promised Sir Eberhard to publish his fate on their return to their homes; and, though he knew the family resources too well to have many hopes, he was rather hurt to find that their promise had been unfulfilled.",change good treat good walk open air chain german comrade pleasanter pine lonely dungeon offer make captive become enter ottoman service voice refuse draught different division noble offer ransom take await arrival promise publish fate return home know family resource have many hope hurt find promise unfulfilled 
78,"“Alas! they had no opportunity,” said Ebbo.  “Gulden were scarce, or were all in Kaisar Friedrich’s great chest; the ransoms could not be raised, and all died in captivity.  I heard about it when I was at Wurms last month.”",have opportunity say scarce great chest ransom raise die captivity hear last month 
79,“The boy at Wurms?” almost gasped Sir Eberhard in amaze.,boy gasp amaze 
80,"“I had to be there about matters concerning the Wildschloss lands and the bridge,” said Ebbo; “and both Dankwart von Schlangenwald and I made special inquiries about that company in case you should have shared their fate.

81,"“You would not have found me,” said his father, narrating how he with a large troop of captives had been driven down to the coast; where they were transferred to a Moorish slave-dealer, who shipped them off for Tunis.  Here, after their first taste of the miseries of a sea life, the alternative of Islam or slavery was again put before them.  “And, by the holy stone of Nicæa,” said Sir Eberhard, “I thought by that time that the infidels had the advantage of us in good-will and friendliness; but, when they told me women had no souls at all, no more than a horse or dog, I knew it was but an empty dream of a religion; for did I not know that my little Ermentrude, and thou, Stine, had finer, clearer, wiser souls than ever a man I had known?  ‘Nay, nay,’ quoth I, ‘I’ll cast in my lot where I may meet my wife hereafter, should I never see her here.’”  He had then been allotted to a corsair, and had thenceforth been chained to the bench of rowers, between the two decks, where, in stifling heat and stench, in storm or calm, healthy or diseased, the wretched oarsmen were compelled to play the part of machinery in propelling the vessel, in order to capture Christian ships—making exertions to which only the perpetual lash of the galley-master could have urged their exhausted frames; often not desisting for twenty or thirty hours, and rowing still while sustenance was put into their mouths by their drivers.  Many a man drew has last breath with his last stroke, and was at the first leisure moment hurled into the waves.  It was the description that had so deeply moved Friedel long ago, and Christina wept over it, as she looked at the bowed form once so proud and free, and thought of the unhealed scars.  But there, her husband added, he had been chained next to a holy friar of German blood, like himself a captive of the great Styrian raid; and, while some blasphemed in their misery, or wildly chid their patron saints, this good man strove to show that all was to work out good; he had a pious saying for all that befell, and adored the will of God in thus purifying him; “And, if it were thus with a saint like him, I thought, what must it be with a rough freebooting godless sinner such as I had been?  See”—and he took out a rosary of strung bladders of seaweed; “that is what he left me when he died, and what I meant to have been telling for ever up in the hermitage.”",find say father narrate large troop captive drive coast transfer moorish slave dealer ship first taste misery sea life alternative slavery put holy stone say think time infidel have advantage good will friendliness tell woman have soul more horse dog know empty dream religion know little have finer clear wise soul man know cast lot meet wife see allot corsair thenceforth chain bench rower deck stifling heat stench storm calm healthy diseased wretch oarsmen compel play part machinery propell vessel order capture christian ship make exertion perpetual lash galley master urge exhaust frame desist hour row sustenance put mouth driver many man draw have last breath last stroke first leisure moment hurl wave description move goot look bow form proud free think unhealed scar husband add chain holy friar german blood captive great styrian raid blasphem misery chid patron saint good man strive show work good have pious say befell adore will purify saint think rough freebooting godless sinner such see take rosary string bladder seaweed leave die mean tell hermitage

How would a lad have fared who so acted in my time?  My poor old mother!

96,"He was led back to his narration, and it appeared that, after some years spent at the oar, certain bleedings from the lungs, the remains of his wound, had become so much more severe as to render him useless for naval purposes; and, as he escaped actually dying during a voyage, he was allowed to lie by on coming into port till he had in some degree recovered, and then had been set to labour at the fortifications, chained to another prisoner, and toiling between the burning sand and burning sun, but treated with less horrible severity than the necessities of the sea had occasioned on board ship, and experiencing the benefit of intercourse with the better class of captives, whom their miserable fate had thrown into the hands of the Moors.",lead narration appear year spend oar certain bleeding lung remains wound become severe render useless naval purpose escape die voyage allow lie come port have degree recover set labour fortification chain prisoner toil burning sand burning sun treat horrible severity necessity sea occasion board ship experience benefit intercourse good class captive miserable fate throw hand

By him Sir Eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality, and treated as befitted his original station, but Battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him.  He had but acted, he said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had received orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been his fellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his ransom, and bring him home.",length own slave name shout call captain gang expect fresh punishment find sell domestic form slavery set jewish agent examine name country station compare answer paper instruction inform ransome cause fetter strike ship order captain consign merchant receive warmest hospitality treat befit original station disclaim merit ransome have act say agent austrian gentleman receive order inquire swabian baron fellow captive live pay ransom bring

It was he who treasured up the thought of the captive German described by the merchant, and even dreamt of it, while never doubting of your death; it was he who caught up Schlangenwald’s first hint that you lived, while I, in my pride, passed it by as merely meant to perplex me; it was he who had formed an absolute purpose of obtaining some certainty; and at last, when my impetuosity had brought on the fatal battle, it was he who bought with his own life the avowal of your captivity.  I had hoped to have fulfilled Friedel’s trust, and to have redeemed my own backwardness; but it is not to be.  While I was yet lying helpless on my bed, the Emperor has taken it out of my power.

112,"This, it appeared, was far from being his deliverer’s fault.  Money had been supplied, and Sir Eberhard had travelled as far as Aosta with a party of Italian merchants; but no sooner had he parted with them than he was completely astray.  His whole experience of life had been as a robber baron or as a slave, and he knew not how to take care of himself as a peaceful traveller; he suffered fresh extortions at every stage, and after a few days was plundered by his guides, beaten, and left devoid of all means of continuing the journey to which he could hardly hope for a cheerful end.  He did not expect to find his mother living,—far less that his unowned wife could have survived the perils in which he had involved her; and he believed that his ancestral home would, if not a ruin, be held by his foes, or at best by the rival branch of the family, whose welcome of the outlawed heir would probably be to a dungeon, if not a halter.  Yet the only magnet on earth for the lonely wanderer was his native mountain, where from some old peasant he might learn how his fair young bride had perished, and perhaps the sins of his youth might be expiated by continual prayer in the hermitage chapel where his sister lay buried, and whence he could see the crags for which his eye and heart had craved so long with the home-sickness of a mountaineer.",appear deliverer fault money supply travel party italian merchant part astray whole experience life robber baron slave know take care peaceful traveller suffer fresh extortion stage few day plunder guide beat leave devoid means continue journey hope cheerful end expect find mother live less unowned wife survive peril involve believe ancestral home ruin hold foe good rival branch family welcome outlaw heir dungeon halter only magnet earth lonely wanderer native mountain old peasant learn fair young bride perish sin youth expiate continual prayer hermitage chapel sister bury see crag eye heart crave home sickness mountaineer 
113,"And now, when his own Christina had welcomed him with all the overflow of her loving heart, unchanged save that hers had become a tenderer yet more dignified loveliness; when his gallant son, in all the bloom of young manhood, received him with dutiful submission; when the castle, in a state of defence, prosperity, and comfort of which he had never dreamt, was again his own;—still the old man was bewildered, and sometimes oppressed almost to distress.  He had, as it were, fallen asleep in one age of the world, and wakened in another, and it seemed as if he really wished to defer his wakening, or else that repose was an absolute novelty to him; for he sat dozing in his chair in the sun the whole of the next day, and scarcely spoke.",own welcome overflow loving heart unchanged become tenderer dignified loveliness gallant son bloom young manhood receive dutiful submission castle state defence prosperity comfort dreamt own old man bewilder oppress distress fall asleep age world waken seem wish defer wakening repose absolute novelty sit doze chair sun whole next day speak 
114,"Ebbo, who felt it a necessity to come to an understanding of the terms on which they were to stand, tried to refer matters to him, and to explain the past, but he was met sometimes by a shake of the head, sometimes by a nod—not of assent, but of sleep; and his mother advised him not to harass the wearied traveller, but to leave him to himself at least for that day, and let him take his own time for exertion, letting things meantime go on as usual.  Ebbo obeyed, but with a load at his heart, as he felt that all he was doing was but provisional, and that it would be his duty to resign all that he had planned, and partly executed, to this incompetent, ignorant rule.  He could certainly, when not serving the Emperor, go and act for himself at Thekla’s dower castle of Felsenbach, and his mother might save things from going to utter ruin at Adlerstein; but no reflection or self-reproach could make it otherwise than a bitter pill to any Telemachus to have to resign to one so unlike Ulysses in all but the length of his wanderings,—one, also, who seemed only half to like, and not at all to comprehend, his Telemachus.",feel necessity come understanding term stand try refer matter explain past meet shake head nod assent sleep mother advise harass weary traveller leave least day let take own time exertion let thing go usual obey load heart feel do provisional duty resign plan execute incompetent ignorant rule serve emperor go act dower castle mother save thing go utter ruin reflection self reproach make bitter pill have resign length wandering seem half comprehend 
115,"Meantime Ebbo attended to such matters as were sure to come each day before the Herr Freiherr.  Now it was a question whether the stone for the mill should be quarried where it would undermine a bit of grass land, or further on, where the road was rougher; now Berend’s swine had got into Barthel’s rye, and Barthel had severely hurt one of them—the Herr Freiherr’s interference could alone prevent a hopeless quarrel; now a waggon with ironwork for the mill claimed exemption from toll as being for the Baron: and he must send down the toll, to obviate injustice towards Schlangenwald and Ulm.  Old Ulrich’s grandson, who had run away for a lanzknecht, had sent a letter home (written by a comrade), the Baron must read and answer it.  Steinmark’s son wanted to be a poor student: the Herr Freiherr must write him a letter of recommendation. Mother Grethel’s ewe had fallen into a cleft; her son came to borrow a rope, and ask aid, and the Baron must superintend the hoisting the poor beast up again.  Hans had found the track of a wolf, and knew the hole where a litter of cubs abode; the Freiherr, his wolf-hound, and his spear were wanted for their destruction.  Dietrich could not tell how to manage his new arquebus: the Baron must teach him to take aim.  Then there was a letter from Ulm to invite the Baron to consult on the tax demanded by the Emperor for his Italian war, and how far it should concern the profits of the bridge; and another letter from the Markgraf of Wurtemburg, as chief of the Swabian League, requesting the Lord of Adlerstein to be on the look-out for a band of robbers, who were reported to be in neighbouring hills, after being hunted out of some of their other lurking-places.",attend such matter sure come day question stone mill quarry undermine bit grass land road rougher swine get rye hurt interference prevent hopeless quarrel waggon ironwork mill claim exemption toll send toll obviate injustice old grandson run lanzknecht send letter home write comrade read answer son want poor student write letter recommendation ewe fall cleft son come borrow rope ask aid superintend hoist poor beast find track wolf know hole litter cub abode wolf hound spear want destruction tell manage new arquebus teach take aim be letter invite consult tax demand italian war concern profit bridge letter chief swabian request look band robber report neighbour hill hunt other lurking place 
116,"That very night, or rather nearly at the dawn of a summer morning, there was a yelling below the castle, and a flashing of torches, and tidings rang through it that a boor on the outskirts of the mountain had had his ricks fired and his cattle driven by the robbers, and his young daughters carried off.  Old Sir Eberhard hobbled down to the hall in time to see weapons flashing as they were dealt out, to hear a clear decided voice giving orders, to listen to the tramp of horse, and watch more reitern pass out under the gateway than ever the castle had counted in his father’s time.  Then he went back to his bed, and when he came down in the morning, found all the womankind of the castle roasting and boiling. And, at noon, little Thekla came rushing down from the watch-tower with news that all were coming home up the Eagle’s Steps, and she was sure _her_ baron had sent her, and waved to her.  Soon after, _her_ baron in his glittering steel rode his cream-coloured charger (once Friedel’s) into the castle court, followed by his exultant merrymen.  They had overtaken the thieves in good time, made them captives, and recovered the spoil unhurt; and Heinz and Koppel made the castle ring with the deed of their young lord, who had forced the huge leader of the band to the earth, and kept him down by main strength till they could come to bind him.",very night dawn summer morning be yelling castle flash torche tiding ring boor outskirt mountain have rick fire cattle drive robber young daughter carry old hobble hall time see weapon flash deal hear clear decide voice give order listen tramp horse watch more reitern pass gateway castle count father time go bed come morning find womankind castle roasting boil noon little come rush watch tower news come sure _her_ baron send wave baron glitter steel ride cream coloured charge castle court follow exultant merrymen overtake thief good time make captive recover spoil unhurt make castle ring deed young lord force huge leader band earth keep main strength come bind
