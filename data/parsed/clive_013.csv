2," Handsome rooms, with a suite of attendants, were assigned to Charlie in the rajah's palace; and he was formally appointed commander of his forces. The four Sepoys were appointed to junior ranks, as was also Tim Kelly; who, however, insisted on remaining in the position of chief attendant upon his master; being, in fact, a sort of majordomo and valet in one, looking after his comforts when in the palace, and accompanying him as personal guard whenever he rode out.",handsome room suite attendant assign palace appoint commander force appoint junior rank insist remain position chief attendant master fact sort majordomo valet look comfort palace accompany personal guard ride

4,"At first, Charlie perceived that his position excited some jealousy in the minds of those surrounding the rajah. He therefore did all in his power to show to them that he, in no way, aspired to interfere in the internal politics or affairs of the little state--that he was a soldier and nothing more. He urged upon the rajah, who wished to have him always by him, that it was far better that he should appear to hold aloof, and to avoid all appearance of favouritism, or of a desire to obtain dominance in the counsels of the rajah. He wished that the appointments to the posts of officers in the new force should be made by the rajah, who should lend an ear to the advice of his usual councillors; but that, once appointed, they should be under his absolute command and control, and that he should have power to dismiss those who proved themselves indolent and incapable, to promote active and energetic men, wholly regardless of influence or position.",perceive position excite jealousy mind surround do power show way aspire interfere internal politics affair little state soldier more urge wish have good appear hold aloof avoid appearance favouritism desire obtain dominance counsel rajah wish appointment post officer new force make lend ear advice usual councillor appoint absolute command control have power dismiss prove indolent incapable promote active energetic man influence position 
5,"The next morning, Charlie and his four assistants set to work to drill the three hundred men of the garrison, taking them in parties of twenty. They were thus able, in the course of a few days, to pick out the most active and intelligent for the sub-officers; and these, with the existing officers of the body, and the new ones appointed by the rajah, were at once taken in hand to be taught their duty.",next morning assistant set work drill man garrison take party able course few day pick active intelligent sub officer exist officer body new one appoint rajah take hand teach duty 
6,"For a month, the work went on steadily and without interruption, and from morn till night the courtyard echoed with the words of command. At the end of that time, the twenty officers and forty sub-officers had fairly learned their duty. The natives of India are very quick in learning drill, and a regiment of newly-raised Sepoys will perform manoeuvres and answer to words of command, in the course of a fortnight, as promptly and regularly as would one of English recruits in three months.",month work go interruption morn night courtyard echoe word command end time officer sub -officer learn duty native quick learning drill regiment raise sepoy perform manoeuvre answer word command course fortnight english recruit month 
7,"A good many changes had taken place during the month's work. Many of the officers became disgusted with hard and continuous work, to which they were unaccustomed, while some of the sub-officers showed a deficiency of the quickness and intelligence needed for the work. Their places, however, were easily filled, and as the days went on, all took an increasing degree of interest, as they acquired facility of movement, and saw how quickly, according to the European methods, manoeuvres were gone through. At the end of a month, then, the sixty men were able in turn to instruct others; and, a body of five hundred men being called out, the work of drilling on a large scale began.",good many change take place month work many officer become disgusted hard continuous work unaccustom sub officer show deficiency quickness intelligence need work place fill day go take increase degree interest acquire facility movement see accord european method manoeuvre go end month man able turn instruct other body man call work drilling large scale begin 
8,"The drill ground now was a level space in the valley below the town, and the whole population assembled, day after day, to look on with astonishment at the exercises. The four great companies, or battalions, as Charlie called them, were kept entirely separate, each under the command of one of the Sepoys, under whom were a proportion of the officers and sub-officers. Every evening, Charlie came down for an hour, and put each body through its drill, distributing blame or praise as it was deserved, thus keeping up a spirit of emulation between the battalions. At the end of a fortnight, when the simpler manoeuvres had been learned, Charlie, for two hours each day, worked the whole together as one regiment; and was surprised, himself, to find how rapid was the progress which each day effected.",drill ground level space valley town whole population assemble day day look astonishment exercise great company battalion call keep separate command proportion officer sub-officer evening come hour put body drill distribute blame praise deserve keep spirit emulation battalion end fortnight simple manoeuvre learn hour day work whole regiment surprise find rapid progress day effect 
9,"The rajah himself often came down to the drill ground, and took the highest interest in the work. He himself would fain have had regular uniforms, similar to those worn by the Sepoys in the service of the European powers, provided for the men; but Charlie strongly urged him not to do so. He admitted that the troops would look immensely better, if clad in regular uniform; than as a motley band, each dressed according to his own fancy. He pointed out, however, that while the news that the rajah was having some of his men drilled by European deserters would attract but little attention among his neighbours, the report that he was raising Sepoy battalions would certainly be received by them in a hostile spirit.",come drill ground take high interest work have regular uniform similar wear service european power provide man urge do admit troops look good clad regular uniform motley band dress accord own fancy point news rajah have man drill european deserter attract little attention neighbour report raise battalion receive hostile spirit 
10,"""By all means,"" Charlie said, ""get the uniforms made for the whole force, and keep them by you in store. They can be at once served out in case of war, and the sight of a number of Sepoy battalions, where they expected only to meet an irregular force, will have an immense effect upon any force opposed to you.""",means say get uniform make whole force keep store serve case war sight number battalion expect meet irregular force have immense effect force oppose 
11,"The rajah saw the force of this argument, and at once ordered five thousand suits of white uniforms, similar to those worn by the Sepoys in the English and French service, to be made and stored up in the magazines.",see force argument order suit white uniform similar wear english french service make store magazine 
12,"While his lieutenants were drilling the main body, Charlie himself took in hand a party of forty picked men, and instructed them in the use of field guns. The superiority of Europeans in artillery was one of the reasons which gave to them such easy victory, in their early battles with the native forces in India. The latter possessed a very powerful artillery, in point of numbers, but there was no regular drill nor manner of loading. They were in the habit, too, of allowing each gun to cool after it was fired, before being loaded again. It was thought, therefore, good practice if a gun were discharged once in a quarter of an hour. They were, then, utterly astounded and dismayed at the effects of the European guns, each of which could be loaded and fired twice, or even three times, a minute.",lieutenant drill main body take hand party pick man instruct use field gun superiority artillery reason give such easy victory early battle native force latter possess powerful artillery point number be regular drill manner loading habit allow gun cool fire load think good practice gun discharge quarter hour astound dismay effect european gun load fire time minute 
13,"So month passed after month, until Rajah Boorhau was in a position to put, if necessary, five battalions of Sepoys, each seven hundred strong, into the field; with thirty guns, served by trained artillerymen. So quietly had the work gone on, that it attracted no attention among his neighbours. The mere rumour that the rajah had some European deserters in his service, and that these were drilling four or five hundred men, was considered of so little moment that it passed altogether unheeded.",month pass month position put necessary battalion strong field gun serve train artillerymen have work go attract attention neighbour mere rumour have european deserter service drill man consider little moment pass unheeded 
14,"The accounts of the state of affairs in the Carnatic, which reached Charlie, were not satisfactory--Dupleix, with his usual energy, was aiding the son of Chunda Sahib, with men and money, in his combat with the British protege; and most of the native allies of the latter had fallen away from him. Trichinopoli was again besieged, and the fortunes of England, lately so flourishing, were waning again. In the Deccan, French influence was supreme. Bussy, with a strong and well-disciplined French force, maintained Salabut Jung, whom the French had placed on the throne, against all opponents. At one time it was the Peishwar, at another the Mahrattas against whom Bussy turned his arms; and always with success, and the French had acquired the four districts on the coast, known as the Northern Sircas.",account state affair reach satisfactory usual energy aid son man money combat british protege most native ally latter fall besiege fortune flourish wane french influence supreme strong disciplined french force maintain place throne opponent time turn arm success acquire district coast know northern 
15,"It was in vain that Charlie endeavoured to gain an accurate knowledge of the political position, so quickly and continually did this change. At one time the Peishwar and the Nizam, as the Subadar of the Deccan was now called, would be fighting in alliance against one or other of the Mahratta chiefs. At another time they would be in conflict with each other, while the Rajah of Mysore, Murari Reo, and other chiefs were sometimes fighting on one side, sometimes on another.",vain endeavour gain accurate knowledge political position do change time call fight alliance other chief time conflict other other chief fight side 
16,"Proud of his rapidly increasing force, Boorhau Reo would, more than once in the course of the year, have joined in the warfare going on around. Charlie, however, succeeded in restraining him from doing so; pointing out that the victor of one day was the vanquished of the next, and that it was worse than useless to join in a struggle of which the conditions were so uncertain, and the changes of fortune so rapid, that none could count upon others for aid, however great the assistance they might have rendered only a short time before.",proud increase force more course year join warfare go succeed restrain do point victor day vanquish next bad useless join struggle condition uncertain change fortune rapid count other aid great assistance render short time 
17,"""Were you to gain territory, Rajah, which you might, perhaps, largely do, from the efficient aid which you might render to one party or the other, you would be the object of a hostile combination against which you could not hope to struggle.""",gain territory do efficient aid render party other object hostile combination hope struggle 
18,"The rajah yielded at once to Charlie's arguments; but the influence of the latter added to the hostility, which the favour shown him by the rajah had provoked, among many of the leading men of the state. Where the sides were often so closely balanced as was the case in these intestine struggles, the aid of every rajah, however small his following, was sought by one or other of the combatants; and the counsellors of those able to place a respectable force in the field were heavily bribed, by one side or the other. Those around Rajah Boorhau found their efforts completely baffled by the influence of the English commander of his forces, and a faction of increasing strength and power was formed to overthrow him. The rajah himself had kept his secret well, and one or two, only, of his advisers knew that the Englishman was a trusted agent of the Company.",yield argument influence latter add hostility favour show provoke many lead man state side balance case intestine struggle aid rajah small follow seek other combatant counsellor able place respectable force field bribe side other find effort baffle influence english commander force faction increase strength power form overthrow keep secret adviser know trust agent company 
19,"The soldiers were much attached to their English leader. They found him always just and firm. Complaints were always listened to, tyranny or ill treatment by the officers suppressed and punished, merit rewarded. Among the officers the strictness of the discipline alienated many, who contrasted the easy life which they had led before the introduction of the European system, with that which they now endured. So long as they were engaged in mastering the rudiments of drill they felt their disadvantage; but when this was acquired, each thought himself capable of taking the place of the English adventurer, and of leading the troops he had organized to victory. Already, Charlie had received several anonymous warnings that danger threatened him. The rajah was, he knew, his warm friend; and he, in his delight at seeing the formidable force which had been formed from his irregular levies, had presented him, as a token of his gratitude, with large sums of money.",soldier attach english leader find firm complaint listen tyranny ill treatment officer suppress punish merit reward officer strictness discipline alienate many contrast easy life lead introduction european system endure engage master rudiment drill feel disadvantage acquire think capable take place english adventurer lead troops organize victory receive several anonymous warning danger threaten rajah know warm friend delight see formidable force form irregular levy present token gratitude large sum money 
20,"In those days, this was the method by which Indian princes rewarded European officers who rendered them service, and it was considered by no means derogatory to the latter to accept the money. This was, indeed, the universal custom, and Charlie, knowing that Captain Clive had received large presents of this kind, had no hesitation in following his example. The treasures stored up by many of these Indian princes were immense, and a lac of rupees, equivalent to ten thousand pounds, was considered by no means a large present. Charlie, foreseeing that, sooner or later, the little state would become involved in hostilities, took the precaution of forwarding the money he had received down to Madras; sending it piecemeal, in charge of native merchants and traders. It was, by these, paid into the Madras treasury, where a large rate of interest, for all monies lent by its employees, was given by the Company.",day method indian prince reward european officer render service consider means derogatory latter accept money universal custom know receive large present kind have hesitation follow example treasure store many indian prince immense lac rupee equivalent pound consider mean large present foresee little state become involve hostility take precaution forward money receive send piecemeal charge native merchant trader pay treasury large rate interest money loan employee give company 
21,"For those at home he felt no uneasiness. It was very seldom that their letters reached him; but he learned that they were still in high favour with his uncle, that his mother continued installed at the head of the house, and that the girls were both at excellent schools.",home feel uneasiness seldom letter reach learn high favour uncle mother continue install head house girl excellent school 
22,"Charlie mentioned, to the rajah, the rumours which had reached him of a plot against him. The rajah assured him of his own support, under all circumstances, and offered that a strong guard should be placed, night and day, over the apartments he occupied.",mention rajah rumour reach plot assure own support circumstance offer strong guard place night day apartment occupy 
23,This Charlie declined.,decline 
24,"""A guard can always be corrupted,"" he said. ""My Irish servant sleeps in my anteroom, my four lieutenants are close at hand, and knowing that the soldiers are, for the most part, attached to me, I do not think that open force will be used. I will, however, cause a large bell to be suspended above my quarters. Its ringing will be a signal that I am attacked, in which case I rely upon your highness putting yourself at the head of the guard, and coming to my assistance.""",guard corrupt say irish servant sleep anteroom lieutenant close hand know soldier most part attach think open force use cause large bell suspend quarter ring signal attack case rely highness put head guard come assistance 
25,"Tim Kelly was at once furious and alarmed, at the news that danger threatened his master, and took every precaution that he could imagine to ensure his safety. He took to going down to the town, himself, to purchase provisions; and, so far as possible, prepared these himself. He procured two or three monkeys, animals which he held in horror, and offered them a portion of everything that came on the table, before he placed it before his master.",furious alarmed news danger threaten master take precaution imagine ensure safety take go town purchase provision possible prepare procure monkey animal hold horror offer portion come table place master 
26,"Charlie at first protested against this, as his dinner became cold by waiting; but Tim had an oven prepared, and ordered dinner half an hour before the time fixed by his master. Each dish as brought in was, after a portion had been given to a monkey, placed in the oven, and thus half an hour was given to allow the poison to work. This was done without Charlie's knowledge, the oven being placed in the anteroom, and the dishes thence brought in, in regular order, by the body servant, whom even Tim allowed to be devoted to his master.",protest dinner become cold wait have oven prepare order dinner hour time fix master dish bring portion give monkey place oven hour give allow poison work do knowledge oven place anteroom dish bring regular order body servant allow devote master

I will go across to the rajah.""",look serious say go call man guardhouse seize cook place man sentry other servant go

43,"""I would rather let ten guilty men escape,"" Charlie replied, ""than run the risk of putting one innocent one to death. I propose, sir, that you order the eight dishes of food, which have been prepared for my dinner, to be carefully weighed. Let these be all placed in the cell of the prisoner, and there let him be left. In the course of two or three days he will, if guilty, endeavour to assuage his hunger by eating little bits of food, from every dish except that which he knows to be poisoned, but will take such a small portion from each that he will think it will not be detected. If he is innocent, and is really ignorant which dish is poisoned, he will not touch any of them, until driven to desperation by hunger. Then he will seize on one or more, and devour them to the end, running the chance of death by poison, rather than endure the pangs of hunger longer.""",let guilty man escape reply run risk put innocent one death propose sir order dish food prepare dinner weigh let place cell prisoner let leave course day guilty endeavour assuage hunger eat little bit food dish know poison take small portion think detect innocent ignorant dish poison touch drive desperation hunger seize more devour end run chance death poison endure pang hunger

45,"These orders were carried out, and on the following morning the dishes were placed in the cell of the prisoner. When removed at night, they were found to be untouched.

67,"Tim Kelly, who felt the strongest doubts as to the prudence of the proceeding, observed that Hossein no longer bought articles from men who brought them up to sell to the soldiers, but that every morning he went out early, and purchased all the supplies he desired from the shopkeepers in the town. Tim mentioned the fact to his master, who said:",feel strong doubt prudence proceeding observe buy article man bring sell soldier morning go purchase supplies desire shopkeeper town mention fact master say
