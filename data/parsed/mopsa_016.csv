1,CHAPTER XVI. FAILURE.,failure 
2,"  We are much bound to them that do succeed;     But, in a more pathetic sense, are bound     To such as fail. They all our loss expound;   They comfort us for work that will not speed,   And life--itself a failure. Ay, his deed,     Sweetest in story, who the dusk profound     Of Hades flooded with entrancing sound,   Music's own tears, was failure. Doth it read   Therefore the worse? Ah, no! so much to dare,     He fronts the regnant Darkness on its throne.--   So much to do; impetuous even there,     He pours out love's disconsolate sweet moan--   He wins; but few for that his deed recall:   Its power is in the look which costs him all.",bound succeed pathetic sense bind such fail loss expound comfort work speed life failure deed sweetest story dusk profound flood entrancing sound own tear failure read bad much dare front regnant throne much do impetuous pour love disconsolate sweet moan win few deed recall power look cost 
3," At this moment Jack observed that a strange woman was standing among them, and that the trainbearing fairies fell back, as if they were afraid of her. As no one spoke, he did, and said, ""Good-morning!""",moment observe strange woman stand trainbearing fairy fall afraid speak say good morning

9,"""As you please,"" said the black fairy, and walked away.",say black fairy walk 
10,"Then they all observed that a brown woman was standing there; and she stepped up and whispered in the boy-king's ear. As he listened his sullen face became good tempered, and at last he said, in a gentle tone, ""Jack, I'm quite ready to begin if you are.""",observe brown woman stand step whisper boy king ear listen sullen face become good temper last say gentle tone ready begin 
11,"""But where are we to dig?"" asked Jack.",dig ask 
12,"""There,"" said a white fairy, stepping up and setting her foot on the grass just under the little hole. ""Dig down as deep as you can.""",say white fairy step set foot grass little hole dig deep 
13,"So Mopsa and the crowd stood back, and the two boys began to dig; and greatly they enjoyed it, for people can dig so fast in Fairyland.",crowd stand boy begin dig enjoy person dig 
14,"Very soon the hole was so deep that they had to jump into it, because they could not reach the bottom with their spades. ""This is very jolly indeed,"" said Jack, when they had dug so much deeper that they could only see out of the hole by standing on tiptoe.",hole deep have jump reach bottom spade jolly say dig deep see hole stand tiptoe 
15,"""Go on,"" said the white fairy; so they dug till they came to a flat stone, and then she said, ""Now you can stamp. Stamp on the stone, and don't be afraid."" So the two Jacks began to stamp, and in such a little time that she had only half turned her head round, the flat stone gave way, for there was a hollow underneath it, and down went the boys, and utterly disappeared.",go say white fairy dig come flat stone say stamp stamp stone afraid begin stamp little time half turn head flat stone give way be hollow go boy disappear 
16,"Then, while Mopsa and the crowd silently looked on, the white fairy lightly pushed the clods of earth towards the hole with the side of her foot, and in a very few minutes the hole was filled in, and that so completely and so neatly, that when she had spread the turf on it, and given it a pat with her foot, you could not have told where it had been. Mopsa said not a word, for no fairy ever interferes with a stronger fairy; but she looked on earnestly, and when the white stranger smiled she was satisfied.",crowd look white fairy push clod earth hole side foot few minute hole fill spread turf give pat foot tell say word fairy interfere strong fairy look white stranger smile satisfied 
17,"Then the white stranger walked away, and Mopsa and the fairies sat down on a bank under some splendid cedar-trees. The beautiful castle looked fairer than ever in the afternoon sunshine; a lovely waterfall tumbled with a tinkling noise near at hand, and the bank was covered with beautiful wild flowers.",white stranger walk fairy sit bank splendid cedar tree beautiful castle look fair afternoon sunshine lovely waterfall tumble tinkling noise hand bank cover beautiful wild flower 
18,"They sat for a long while, and no one spoke: what they were thinking of is not known, but sweet Mopsa often sighed.",sit long while speak think know sweet sigh 
19,"At last a noise,--a very, very slight noise, as of the footsteps of people running,--was heard inside the rock, and then a little quivering was seen in the wand. It quivered more and more as the sound increased. At last that which had looked like a door began to shake as if some one was pushing it from within. Then a noise was distinctly heard as of a key turning in the hole, and out burst the two Jacks, shouting for joy, and a whole troop of knights and squires and serving-men came rushing wildly forth behind them.",last noise slight noise footstep person run hear rock little quivering see wand quiver more more sound increase last look door begin shake one push noise hear key turning hole burst shouting joy whole troop knight squire serving man come rush 
20,"Oh, the joy of that meeting! who shall describe it? Fairies by dozens came up to kiss the boy-king's hand, and Jack shook hands with every one that could reach him. Then Mopsa proceeded to the castle between the two Jacks, and the king's aunt came out to meet them, and welcomed her husband with tears of joy; for these fairies could laugh and cry when they pleased, and they naturally considered this a great proof of superiority.",joy meeting describe fairy dozen come kiss boy king hand shake hand one reach proceed castle king aunt come meet welcome husband tear joy fairy laugh cry pleased consider great proof superiority 
21,"After this a splendid feast was served under the great dome. The other fairy feasts that Jack had seen were nothing to it. The prince and his dame sat at one board, but Mopsa sat at the head of the great table, with the two Jacks, one on each side of her.",splendid feast serve great dome other fairy feast see prince dame sit board sit head great table side 
22,"Mopsa was not happy, Jack was sure of that, for she often sighed; and he thought this strange. But he did not ask her any questions, and he, with the boy-king, related their adventures to her: how, when the stone gave way, they tumbled in and rolled down a sloping bank till they found themselves at the entrance of a beautiful cave, which was all lighted up with torches, and glittering with stars and crystals of all the colors in the world. There was a table spread with what looked like a splendid luncheon in this great cave, and chairs were set round, but Jack and the boy-king felt no inclination to eat anything, though they were hungry, for a whole nation of ants were creeping up the honey-pots. There were snails walking about over the table-cloth, and toads peeping out of some of the dishes.",happy sure sigh think strange ask question boy king relate adventure stone give way tumble roll slope bank find entrance beautiful cave light torche glitter star crystal color world be table spread look splendid luncheon great cave chair set boy king feel inclination eat hungry whole nation ant creep honey pot be snail walk table cloth toad peep dish 
23,"So they turned away, and, looking for some other door to lead them farther in, they at last found a very small one,--so small that only one of them could pass through at a time.",turn look other door lead find small one small pass time 
24,They did not tell Mopsa all that had occurred on this occasion. It was thus:,tell occur occasion 
25,"The boy-king said, ""I shall go in first, of course, because of my rank.""",boy king say go course rank 
26,"""Very well,"" said Jack, ""I don't mind. I shall say to myself that you've gone in first to find the way for me, because you're my double. Besides, now I think of it, our Queen always goes last in a procession; so it's grand to go last. Pass in, Jack.""",say mind say go first find way double think go last procession grand go last pass 
27,"""No,"" answered the other Jack; ""now you have said that I will not. You may go first.""",answer other say go 
28,"So they began to quarrel and argue about this, and it is impossible to say how long they would have gone on if they had not begun to hear a terrible and mournful sort of moaning and groaning, which frightened them both and instantly made them friends. They took tight hold of one another's hand, and again there came by a loud sighing, and a noise of all sorts of lamentation, and it seemed to reach them through the little door.",begin quarrel argue impossible say go begin hear terrible mournful sort moan groan frighten make friend take tight hold hand come loud sighing noise sort lamentation seem reach little door 
29,"Each of the boys would now have been very glad to go back, but neither liked to speak. At last Jack thought anything would be less terrible than listening to those dismal moans, so he suddenly dashed through the door, and the other Jack followed.",boy glad go like speak last think terrible listen dismal moan dash door other follow 
30,"There was nothing terrible to be seen. They found themselves in a place like an immensely long stable; but it was nearly dark, and when their eyes got used to the dimness, they saw that it was strewed with quantities of fresh hay, from which curious things like sticks stuck up in all directions. What were they?",be terrible see find place long stable dark eye use dimness see strew quantity fresh hay curious thing stick stick direction 
31,"""They are dry branches of trees,"" said the boy-king.",dry branch tree say boy king 
32,"""They are table-legs turned upside down,"" said Jack: but then the other Jack suddenly perceived the real nature of the thing, and he shouted out, ""No; they are antlers!""",table leg turn say other perceive real nature thing shout antler 
33,"The moment he said this the moaning ceased, hundreds of beautiful antlered heads were lifted up, and the two boys stood before a splendid herd of stags; but they had had hardly time to be sure of this when the beautiful multitude rose and fled away into the darkness, leaving the two boys to follow as well as they could.",moment say moan cease hundred beautiful antlered head lift boy stand splendid herd stag have time sure beautiful multitude rise flead darkness leave boy follow 
34,"They were sure they ought to run after the herd, and they ran and ran, but they soon lost sight of it, though they heard far on in front what seemed at first like a pattering of deer's feet, but the sound changed from time to time. It became heavier and louder, and then the clattering ceased, and it was evidently the tramping of a great crowd of men. At last they heard words, very glad and thankful words; people were crying to one another to make haste, lest the spell should come upon them again. Then the two Jacks, still running, came into a grand hall, which was quite full of knights and all sorts of fairy men, and there was the boy-king's uncle, but he looked very pale. ""Unlock the door!"" they cried. ""We shall not be safe till we see our new Queen. Unlock the door; we see light coming through the keyhole.""",sure run herd run run lose sight hear front seem first pattering deer foot sound change time time become heavy louder clattering cease tramping great crowd man last hear word glad thankful word person cry make haste spell come run come grand hall full knight sort fairy man be boy king uncle look pale unlock door cry safe see new unlock door see light come keyhole 
35,"The two Jacks came on to the front, and felt and shook the door. At last the boy-king saw a little golden key glittering on the floor, just where the one narrow sunbeam fell that came through the keyhole; so he snatched it up. It fitted, and out they all came, as you have been told.",come front feel shake door last boy king see little golden key glitter floor narrow sunbeam fall come keyhole snatch fit come tell 
36,"When they had done relating their adventures, the new Queen's health was drunk. And then they drank the health of the boy-king, who stood up to return thanks, and, as is the fashion there, he sang a song. Jack thought it the most ridiculous song he had ever heard; but as everybody else looked extremely grave, he tried to be grave too. It was about Cock-Robin and Jenny Wren, how they made a wedding feast, and how the wren said she should wear her brown gown, and the old dog brought a bone to the feast.",do relate adventure new health drunk drink health boy king stand return thanks fashion sing song think ridiculous song hear else look grave try grave make wedding feast wren say wear brown gown old dog bring bone feast 
37,"  ""He had brought them,"" he said, ""some meat on a bone:   They were welcome to pick it or leave it alone.""",bring say meat bone welcome pick leave 
38,"The fairies were very attentive to this song; they seemed, if one may judge by their looks, to think it was rather a serious one. Then they drank Jack's health, and afterwards looked at him as if they expected him to sing too; but as he did not begin, he presently heard them whispering, and one asking another, ""Do you think he knows manners?""",fairy attentive song seem judge look think serious one drink health look expect sing begin hear whisper ask think know manners 
39,"So he thought he had better try what he could do, and he stood up and sang a song that he had often heard his nurse sing in the nursery at home.",think try do stand sing song hear nurse sing nursery home 
40,"  One morning, oh! so early, my belovèd, my belovèd,   All the birds were singing blithely, as if never they would cease;   'Twas a thrush sang in my garden, ""Hear the story, hear the story!""

And the dove said, ""Give us peace!""",morning belovèd belovèd bird sing cease thrush sing garden hear story hear story lark sing give glory dove say give peace

She made answer, ""Give us love!""",listen belovèd belovèd murmur woodland dove dear dove nightingale come give fame sweet duty wren sing give beauty make answer give love 
42,"  Sweet is spring, and sweet the morning, my belovèd, my belovèd;   Now for us doth spring, doth morning, wait upon the year's         increase,   And my prayer goes up, ""Oh, give us, crowned in youth with marriage         glory,             Give for all our life's dear story,             Give us love, and give us peace!""",sweet spring sweet morning belovèd belovèd doth spring doth morning wait year increase prayer go give crown youth marriage glory give life dear story give love give peace 
43,"""A very good song too,"" said the dame, at the other end of the table; ""only you made a mistake in the first verse. What the dove really said was, no doubt, 'Give us peas.' All kinds of doves and pigeons are very fond of peas.""",good song say dame other end table make mistake first verse dove say doubt give pea kind dove pigeon fond pea 
44,"""It isn't peas, though,"" said Jack. However, the court historian was sent for to write down the song, and he came with a quill pen, and wrote it down as the dame said it ought to be.",pea say court historian send write song come quill pen write dame say 
45,"Now all this time Mopsa sat between the two Jacks, and she looked very mournful,--she hardly said a word.",time sit look mournful say word 
46,"When the feast was over, and everything had vanished, the musicians came in, for there was to be dancing; but while they were striking up, the white fairy stepped in, and, coming up, whispered something in Jack's ear; but he could not hear what she said, so she repeated it more slowly, and still he could neither hear nor understand it.",feast vanish musician come be dancing strike white fairy step come whisper ear hear say repeat hear understand 
47,"Mopsa did not seem to like the white fairy; she leaned her face on her hand and sighed; but when she found that Jack could not hear the message, she said, ""That is well. Cannot you let things alone for this one day?"" The fairy then spoke to Mopsa, but she would not listen; she made a gesture of dislike and moved away. So then this strange fairy turned and went out again, but on the door-step she looked round, and beckoned to Jack to come to her. So he did; and then, as they two stood together outside, she made him understand what she had said. It was this:",seem like white fairy learn face hand sigh find hear message say well let thing alone day fairy speak listen make gesture dislike move strange fairy turn go door step look beckon come stand make understand say

50,"He walked up and down, up and down, outside, and his heart swelled and his eyes filled with tears. The bells had said he was to go home, and the fairy had told him how to go. Mopsa did not need him, she had so many people to take care of her; and then there was that boy, so exactly like himself that she would not miss him. Oh, how sorrowful it all was! Had he really come up the fairy river, and seen those strange countries, and run away with Mopsa over those dangerous mountains, only to bring her to the very place she wished to fly from, and there to leave her, knowing that she wanted him no more, and that she was quite content?",walk heart swell eye fill tear bell say go fairy tell go need have many person take care be boy miss sorrowful come fairy river see strange country run dangerous mountain bring very place wish fly leave know want more content

52,"As he spoke, he drew near to the great yawning door, and looked in. The fairy folk were singing inside; he could hear their pretty chirping voices, and see their beautiful faces, but he could not bear it, and he turned away.",speak draw great yawning door look fairy folk sing hear pretty chirping voice see beautiful face bear turn 
53,"The sun began to get low, and all the west was dyed with crimson. Jack dried his eyes, and, not liking to go in, took one turn more.",sun begin get low west dyed crimson dry eye like go take turn more

66,"Suddenly he perceived that reeds were growing up between him and the great doors: the grass, which had all day grown about the steps, was getting taller; it had long spear-like leaves, it pushed up long pipes of green stem, and they whistled.",perceive reed grow great door grass have day grow step get tall have long spear like leave push long pipe green stem whistle 
67,"They were up to his ankles, they were presently up to his waist; soon they were as high as his head. He drew back that he might see over them; they sprang up faster as he retired, and again he went back. It seemed to him that the castle also receded; there was a long reach of these great reeds between it and him, and now they were growing behind also, and on all sides of him. He kept moving back and back: it was of no use, they sprang up and grew yet more tall, till very shortly the last glimpse of the fairy castle was hidden from his sorrowful eyes.",ankle waist high head draw see spring fast retire go seem castle reced be long reach great reed grow side keep move use spring grow tall last glimpse fairy castle hide sorrowful eye 
68,"The sun was just touching the tops of the purple mountains when Jack lost sight of Mopsa's home; but he remembered how he had penetrated the bed of reeds in the morning, and he hoped to have the same good fortune again. So on and on he walked, pressing his way among them as well as he could, till the sun went down behind the mountains, and the rosy sky turned gold color, and the gold began to burn itself away, and then all on a sudden he came to the edge of the reed-bed, and walked out upon a rising ground.",sun touch top purple mountain lose sight home remember penetrate bed reed morning hope have same good fortune walk press way sun go mountain rosy sky turn gold color gold begin burn sudden come edge reed bed walk rise ground 
69,"Jack ran up it, looking for the castle. He could not see it, so he climbed a far higher hill; still he could not see it. At last, after a toilsome ascent to the very top of the green mountain, he saw the castle lying so far, so very far off, that its peaks and its battlements were on the edge of the horizon, and the evening mist rose while he was gazing, so that all its outlines were lost, and very soon they seemed to mingle with the shapes of the hill and the forest, till they had utterly vanished away.",run look castle see climb high hill see last toilsome ascent very top green mountain see castle lie peak battlement edge horizon evening mist rise gaze outline lose seem mingle shape hill forest vanish

72,"In a minute or two he saw a little black mark overhead, a small speck, and it grew larger, and larger, and larger still, as it fell headlong down like a stone. In another instant he saw a red light and a green light, then he heard the winnowing noise of the bird's great wings, and she alighted at his feet, and said, ""Here I am.""",minute see little black mark small speck grow large large large fall stone instant see red light green light hear winnow noise bird great wing alight foot say

74,"""That is well,"" answered the bird. She took Jack on her back, and in three minutes they were floating among the clouds.",answer bird take back minute float cloud 
75,"As Jack's feet were lifted up from Fairyland he felt a little consoled. He began to have a curious feeling, as if this had all happened a good while ago, and then half the sorrow he had felt faded into wonder, and the feeling still grew upon him that these things had passed some great while since, so that he repeated to himself, ""It was a long time ago.""",foot lift feel little console begin have curious feeling happen good while sorrow feel fade wonder feeling grow thing pass great while repeat long time

80,"They were falling so fast that Jack dared not look; but he saw the church, and the wood, and his father's house, which seemed to be starting up to meet him.

85,"He drew a little nearer. His mother sat with her back to the open window, but a candle was burning, and she was reading aloud. Jack listened as she read, and knew that this was not in the least like anything that he had seen in Fairyland, nor the reading like anything that he had heard, and he began to forget the boy-king, and the apple-woman, and even his little Mopsa, more and more.",draw little nearer mother sit open window candle burn read listen read know least see reading hear begin forget boy king apple woman little more more

So Jack did, and got upon his father's knee, where he curled himself up comfortably, laid his head on his father's waistcoat, and wondered what he would think if he should be told about the fairies in somebody else's waistcoat pocket. He thought, besides, what a great thing a man was; he had never seen anything so large in Fairyland, nor so important; so, on the whole, he was glad he had come back, and felt very comfortable. Then his mother, turning over the leaf, lifted up her eyes and looked at Jack, but not as if she was in the least surprised, or more glad to see him than usual; but she smoothed the leaf with her hand, and began again to read, and this time it was about the Shepherd Lady:--",last father notice look surprise beckon finger come get father knee curl lay head father waistcoat wonder think tell fairy else waistcoat pocket think great thing man see large important whole glad come feel comfortable mother turn leaf lift eye look least surprise glad see usual smooth leaf hand begin read time
