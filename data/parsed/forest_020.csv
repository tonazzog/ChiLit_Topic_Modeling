8,"""I will certainly speak to him on the subject,"" said Edward, at the ""risk of his displeasure; and join the army I will, if I find what you say is true.

11,"Edward, much excited by the intelligence, went into the room where he usually sat with the intendant. The latter, who was at his desk, looked up, and saw how flushed Edward was, and said very quietly,",excite intelligence go room sit intendant latter desk look see flush say 
12,"""Edward, you are excited, I presume, from hearing the news which has arrived?""",excited presume hear news arrive

17,"""Such is my intention, I candidly confess, sir. It is my duty.""",such intention confess sir duty 
18,"""Perhaps you may be persuaded to the contrary before we part,"" replied the intendant. ""The first duty you owe is to your family in their present position; they depend upon you; and a false step on your part would be their ruin. How can you leave them, and leave my employ, without it being known for what purpose you are gone? It is impossible! I must myself make it known, and even then it would be very injurious to me, the very circumstance of my having one of your party in my service. I am suspected by many already, in consequence of the part I have taken against the murder of the late king, and also of the lords who have since suffered. But, Edward, I did not communicate this intelligence to you for many reasons. I knew that it would soon come to your ears, and I thought it better that I should be more prepared to show you that you may do yourself and me harm, and can do no good to the king. I will now show you that I do put confidence in you; and if you will read these letters, they will prove to you that I am correct in what I assert.""",persuade contrary part reply intendant first duty owe family present position depend false step part ruin leave leave employ know purpose gone impossible make know injurious very circumstance have party service suspect many consequence part take murder late king lord suffer communicate intelligence many reason know come ear think good prepare show do harm do good king show put confidence read letter prove correct assert 
19,"The intendant handed three letters to Edward, by which it was evident that all the king's friends in England were of opinion that the time was not ripe for the attempt, and that it would be only a sacrifice to stir in the matter; that the Scotch army raised was composed of those who were the greatest enemies to the king, and that the best thing that could happen for the king's interest would be that they were destroyed by Cromwell; that it was impossible for the English adherents of Charles to join them, and that the Scotch did not wish them so to do.",intendant hand letter evident king friend opinion time ripe attempt sacrifice stir matter army raise compose great enemy king good thing happen king interest destroy impossible english adherent join wish do

24,"""That is all I require of you; and, after that promise, you shall hear all the news as soon as it arrives. There are thousands who are just as anxious to see the king on the throne again as you are, Edward--and you now know that I am one of them; but the hour is not yet come, and we must bide our time. Depend upon it, General Cromwell will scatter that army like chaff. He is on his march now.

27,"Edward left the intendant, much pleased with the interview. The intendant kept his word, and concealed nothing from Edward. All turned out as the intendant had foretold. The Scotch army was cut to pieces by Cromwell, and the king retreated to the Highlands; and Edward now felt satisfied that he could do no better than be guided by the intendant in all his future undertakings.",leave intendant pleased interview intendant keep word conceal turn intendant foretell army cut piece king retreat feel satisfied do good guide intendant future undertaking 
28,"We must now pass over some time in a few words. Edward continued at the intendant's, and gave great satisfaction to Mr. Heatherstone. He passed his time very agreeably, sometimes going out to shoot deer with Oswald, and often supplying venison to his brother and sisters at the cottage. During the autumn, Patience very often went to the cottage, and occasionally Mr. Heatherstone paid them a visit; but after the winter set in, Edward came over by himself, shooting as he went; and when he and Smoker came to the cottage, Billy always had a journey to go for the venison left in the forest. Patience sent Alice many little things for the use of her and Edith, and some very good books for them to read; and Humphrey, during the evenings, read with his sisters, that they might learn what he could teach them. Pablo also learned to read and write. Humphrey and Pablo had worked at the saw-pit, and had sawed out a large quantity of boards and timber for building, but the building was put off till the spring.",pass time few word continue intendant give great satisfaction pass time go shoot deer supply venison brother sister cottage autumn patience go cottage pay visit winter set come shoot go come cottage have journey go venison leave forest patience send many little thing use good book read evening read sister learn teach learn read write work saw pit saw large quantity board timber building building put spring 
29,"The reader may recollect that Edward had proposed to Humphrey that he should ascertain whether what the robber had stated before his death relative to his having concealed his ill-gotten wealth under the tree which was struck by lightning was true. About ten days afterward Humphrey set off on this expedition. He did not take Pablo with him, as, although he had a very good opinion of him, he agreed with Oswald that temptation should not be put in his way. Humphrey considered that it would be the best plan to go at once to Clara's cottage, and from that proceed to find the oak-tree mentioned by the robber. When he arrived at the thicket which surrounded the cottage, it occurred to him that he would just go through it and see if it was in the state which they had left it in; for after the intendant had been there, he had given directions to his men to remain and bury the bodies, and then to lock up the doors of the cottage, and bring the keys to him, which had been done. Humphrey tied Billy and the cart to a tree, and walked through the thicket. As he approached the cottage he heard voices; this induced him to advance very carefully, for he had not brought his gun with him. He crouched down as he came to the opening before the cottage. The doors and windows were open, and there were two men sitting outside, cleaning their guns; and in one of them Humphrey recognized the man Corbould, who had been discharged by the intendant as soon as his wound had been cured, and who was supposed to have gone to London. Humphrey was too far off to hear what they said; he remained there some time, and three more men came out of the cottage. Satisfied with what he had seen, Humphrey cautiously retreated, and, gaining the outside of the thicket, led away Billy and the cart over the turf, that the noise of the wheels might not be heard.",reader recollect propose ascertain robber state death relative conceal ill get wealth tree strike lightning true day set expedition take have good opinion agree temptation put way consider good plan go cottage proceed find oak tree mention robber arrive thicket surround cottage occur go see state leave intendant give direction man remain bury body lock door cottage bring key do tie cart tree walk thicket approach cottage hear voice induce advance bring gun crouch come opening cottage door window open be man sit clean gun recognize man discharge intendant wound cure suppose go hear say remain time more man come cottage satisfied see retreat gain outside thicket lead cart turf noise wheel hear 
30,"""This bodes no good,"" thought Humphrey as he went along, every now and then looking back to ascertain if the men had come out and seen him. ""That Corbould we know has vowed vengeance against Edward, and all of us; and has, no doubt, joined those robbers--for robbers they must be--that he may fulfill his vow. It is fortunate that I have made the discovery and I will send over immediately to the intendant."" As soon as a clump of trees had shut out the thicket, and he had no longer any fear of being seen by these people, Humphrey went in the direction which the robber had mentioned, and soon afterward he perceived the oak scathed with lightning, which stood by itself on a green spot of about twenty acres. It had been a noble tree before it had been destroyed; now it spread its long naked arms, covering a large space of ground, but without the least sign of vegetation or life remaining. The trunk was many feet in diameter, and was apparently quite sound, although the tree was dead. Humphrey left Billy to feed on the herbage close by, and then, from the position of the sun in the heavens, ascertained the point at which he was to dig. First looking around him to see that he was not overlooked, he took his spade and pick-ax out of the cart and begun his task. There was a spot not quite so green as the rest, which Humphrey thought likely to be the very place that he should dig at, as probably it was not green from the soil having been removed. He commenced at this spot, and, after a few moments' labor, his pick-ax struck upon something hard, which, on clearing away the earth, he discovered to be a wooden lid of a box. Satisfied that he was right, Humphrey now worked hard, and in a few minutes he had cleared away sufficiently to be able to lift out the box and place it on the turf. He was about to examine it, when he perceived, at about five hundred yards' distance, three men coming toward him. ""They have discovered me,"" thought Humphrey; ""and I must be off as soon as I can."" He ran to Billy, who was close to him, and bringing the cart to where the box lay, he lifted it in. As he was getting in himself, with the reins in his hands, he perceived that the three men were running toward him as fast as they could, and that they all had guns in their hands. They were not more than a hundred and fifty yards from him when Humphrey set off, putting Billy to a full trot.",bode good think go look ascertain man come see know vow vengeance doubt join robber robber fulfill vow fortunate make discovery send intendant clump tree shut thicket have fear see person go direction robber mention perceive oak scath lightning stand green spot acre noble tree destroy spread long naked arm cover large space ground least sign vegetation life remain trunk many foot diameter sound tree dead leave feed herbage position sun heaven ascertain point dig look see overlook take spade pick ax cart begin task be spot green rest think likely very place dig green soil remove commence spot few moment labor pick ax strike hard clear earth discover wooden lid box satisfied right work few minute clear able lift box place turf about examine perceive yard distance man come discover think run close bring cart box lay lift get rein hand perceive man run have gun hand more yard set put full trot 
31,"The three men, observing this, called out to Humphrey to stop, or they would fire; but Humphrey's only reply was giving a lash to Billy, which set him off at a gallop. The men immediately fired, and the bullets whistled past Humphrey without doing any harm. Humphrey looked round, and finding that he had increased his distance, pulled up the pony, and went at a more moderate pace. ""You'll not catch me,"" thought Humphrey; ""and your guns are not loaded, so I'll tantalize you a little."" He made Billy walk, and turned round to see what the men were about; they had arrived at where he had dug out the box, and were standing round the hole, evidently aware that it was no use following him. ""Now,"" thought Humphrey as he went along at a faster pace, ""those fellows will wonder what I have been digging up. The villains little think that I know where to find them, and they have proved what they are by firing at me. Now, what must I do? They may follow me to the cottage, for I have no doubt that they know where we live, and that Edward is at the intendant's. They may come and attack us, and I dare not leave the cottage tonight, or send Pablo away, in case they should; but I will tomorrow morning."" Humphrey considered, as he went along, all the circumstances and probabilities, and decided that he would act as he at first proposed to himself. In an hour he was at the cottage; and as soon as Alice had given him his dinner--for he was later than the usual dinner hour--he told her what had taken place.",man observe call stop fire only reply give lash set gallop man fire bullet whistle do harm look find increase distance pull pony go moderate pace catch think gun load tantalize little make walk turn see man arrive dig box stand hole aware use follow think go fast pace fellow wonder digg villain little think know find prove fire do follow cottage have doubt know live intendant come attack leave cottage tonight send case tomorrow morning consider go circumstance probability decide act propose hour cottage give dinner late usual dinner hour tell take place

33,"""He has been working in the garden with Edith all the day,"" replied Alice.",work garden day reply 
34,"""Well, dear, I hope they will not come tonight: tomorrow I will have them all in custody; but if they do come, we must do our best to beat them off. It is fortunate that Edward left the guns and pistols which he found in Clara's cottage, as we shall have no want of firearms; and we can barricade the doors and windows, so that they can not get in in a hurry; but I must have Pablo to help me, for there is no time to be lost.""",dear hope come tonight tomorrow have custody come do good beat fortunate leave gun pistol find cottage have want firearm barricade door window get hurry have help be time lose

38,"""Pablo,"" said Humphrey, ""we must bring to the cottage some of the large pieces we sawed out for rafters; for I should not be surprised if the cottage were attacked this night.""

41,"""No; fight hard for Missy Alice and Missy Edith,"" said Pablo; ""fight for you too, Massa Humphrey, and fight for myself,"" added Pablo, laughing.",fight say fight fight add laugh 
42,"They then went for the pieces of squared timber, brought them from the saw-pit to the cottage, and very soon fitted them to the doors and windows, so as to prevent several men, with using all their strength, from forcing them open.",go piece square timber bring saw pit cottage fit door window prevent several man use strength force open

48,"""Yes, I will bring you the guns, Humphrey, and you shall shoot them,"" replied Edith.",bring gun shoot reply 
49,"Humphrey kissed his sisters, and they went to their room. He then put a light in the chimney, that he might not have to get one in case the robbers came, and then desired Pablo to go and lie down on his bed, as he intended to do the same. Humphrey remained awake till past three o'clock in the morning, but no robbers came. Pablo was snoring loud, and at last Humphrey fell asleep himself, and did not wake till broad daylight. He got up, and found Alice and Edith were already in the sitting-room, lighting the fire.",kiss sister go room put light chimney have get case robber come desire go lie bed intend do same remain o'clock morning robber come snore last fall wake broad daylight get find sitting room light fire

59,"""They won't come now, at all events, I should think,"" observed Humphrey; ""but there is no saying--they may be prowling about, and may think it easier to get in during daytime than at night.

60,"Pablo took the pistol, and then Humphrey went out of the door and looked well round in front of the cottage, but he would not leave the door till he was assured that no one was there. Pablo returned soon after, saying that he had looked round every where, and into the cow-house and yard, and there was nobody to be seen. This satisfied Humphrey, and they returned to the cottage.",take pistol go door look front cottage leave door assure return say look cow house yard be see satisfy return cottage 
61,"""Now, Pablo, get your breakfast, while I write the letter to the intendant,"" said Humphrey; ""and then you must saddle Billy, and go over to him as fast as you can with the letter. You can tell him all I have not said in it. I shall expect you back at night, and some people with you.""",get breakfast write letter intendant say saddle go letter tell say expect night person 
62,"""I see,"" said Pablo, who immediately busied himself with some cold meat which Alice put before him. Pablo had finished his breakfast and brought Billy to the door, before Humphrey had finished his letter. As soon as it was written and folded, Pablo set off, as fast as Billy could go, to the other side of the forest.",see say busy cold meat put finish breakfast bring door finish letter write fold set go other side forest 
63,"Humphrey continued on the look-out during the whole day, with his gun on his arm, and his two dogs by his side; for he knew the dogs would give notice of the approach of any one, long before he might see them; but nothing occurred during the whole day; and when the evening closed in he barricaded the doors and windows, and remained on the watch with the dogs, waiting for the coming of the robbers, or for the arrival of the party which he expected would be sent by the intendant to take the robbers. Just as it was dark, Pablo returned with a note from Edward, saying that he would be over, and at the cottage by ten o'clock, with a large party.",continue look whole day gun arm dog side know dog give notice approach one see occur whole day evening close barricade door window remain watch dog wait coming robber arrival party expect send intendant take robber dark return note say cottage o'clock large party 
64,"Humphrey had said in his letter, that it would be better that any force sent by the intendant should not arrive till after dark, as the robbers might be near and perceive them, and then they might escape; he did not therefore expect them to come till some time after dark. Humphrey was reading a book--Pablo was dozing in the chimney corner--the two girls had retired into their room and had lain down on the bed in their clothes, when the dogs both gave a low growl.",say letter good force send intendant arrive dark robber perceive escape expect come time dark read book doze chimney corner girl retire room lain bed clothes dog give low growl 
65,"""Somebody come,"" said Pablo, starting up.",come say start 
66,"Again the dogs growled, and Humphrey made a sign to Pablo to hold his tongue. A short time of anxious silence succeeded, for it was impossible to ascertain whether the parties were friends or enemies. The dogs now sprung up and barked furiously at the door, and as soon as Humphrey had silenced them, a voice was heard outside, begging for admission to a poor benighted traveler. This was sufficient; it could not be the party from the intendant's, but the robbers who wished to induce them to open the door. Pablo put a gun into Humphrey's hand, and took another for himself; he then removed the light into the chimney, and on the application from outside being repeated, Humphrey answered,",dog growl make sign hold tongue short time anxious silence succeed impossible ascertain party friend enemy dog spring bark door silence voice hear begg admission poor benighted traveler sufficient party intendant robber wish induce open door put gun hand take remove light chimney application repeat answer 
67,"""That he never opened the door at that hour of the night, and that it was useless their remaining.""",open door hour night useless remain 
68,"No answer or repetition of the request was made, but, as Humphrey retreated with Pablo into the fireplace, a gun was fired into the lock of the door, which was blown off into the room, and, had it not been for the barricades, the doors must have flown open. The robbers appeared surprised at such not being the case, and one of them inserted his arm into the hole made in the door, to ascertain what might be the further obstacle to open it, when Pablo slipped past Humphrey, and gaining the door, discharged his gun under the arm which had been thrust into the hole in the door. The party, whoever it might have been, gave a loud cry, and fell at the threshold outside.",answer repetition request make retreat fireplace gun fire lock door blow room barricade door fly open robber appear surprise such case insert arm hole make door ascertain further obstacle open slip gain door discharge gun arm thrust hole door party give loud cry fall threshold

70,"""Kill much better,"" said Pablo. ""Corbould shot through leg, come again to rob; suppose shot dead, never rob more.""",kill good say shoot leg come rob suppose shoot dead rob more 
71,"The dogs now flew to the back of the cottage, evidently pointing out that the robbers were attempting that side. Humphrey put his gun through the hole in the door, and discharged it.",dog fly back cottage point robber attempt side put gun hole door discharge 
72,"""Why you do that, Massa Humphrey? nobody there!""",do 
73,"""I know that, Pablo; but if the people are coming from the intendant's, they will see the flash and perhaps hear the report, and it will let them know what is going on.""",know person come intendant see flash hear report let know go 
74,"""There is another gun loaded, Humphrey,"" said Alice, who with Edith had joined them without Humphrey observing it.",be gun load say join observe 
75,"""Thanks, love; but you and Edith must not remain here; sit down on the hearth, and then you will be sheltered from any bullet which they may fire into the house. I have no fear of their getting in, and we shall have help directly, I have no doubt.

Do you fire another gun, as a signal, through the hole in the front door.""",thanks love remain sit hearth shelter bullet fire house have fear get have help have doubt fire back door dog have nose violent fire gun signal hole front door 
76,"Humphrey stood within four feet of the back door, and fired just above where the dogs held their noses and barked. Pablo discharged his gun as directed, and then returned to reload the guns. The dogs were now more quiet, and it appeared as if the robbers had retreated from the back door. Pablo blew out the light, which had been put more in the center of the room when Alice and Edith took possession of the fireplace.",stand foot back door fire dog hold nose bark discharge gun direct return reload gun dog quiet appear robber retreat back door blow light put center room take possession fireplace

78,"At last the attack was renewed; the dogs flew backward and forward, sometimes to one door and then to another, as if both were to be assailed; and at the same time a crash in Alice's bedchamber told them that the robbers had burst in the small window in that room, which Humphrey had not paid any attention to, as it was so small that a man could hardly introduce his body through it. Humphrey immediately called Holdfast and opened the door of the room, for he thought that a man forcing his way in would be driven back or held by the dog, and he and Pablo dared not leave the two doors. Watch, the other dog, followed Holdfast into the bedroom; and oaths and curses, mingled with the savage yells of the dogs, told them that a conflict was going on. Both doors were now battered with heavy pieces of timber at the same time, and Pablo said,",last attack renew dog fly door assail same time crash bedchamber tell robber burst small window room pay attention small man introduce body call open door room think man force way drive hold dog leave door watch other dog follow bedroom oath curse mingle savage yell dog tell conflict go door batter heavy piece timber same time say

81,"""The intendant's people are come,"" said Humphrey, ""I am sure of it.""",intendant person come say sure

91,"""In your bedroom, dearest? Well, then, let us go there first.""",bedroom dearest let go 
92,"Edward went in with Humphrey, and found a man half in the window and half out, held by the throat and apparently suffocated by the two dogs. He took the dogs off; and desiring the men to secure the robber, and ascertain whether he was alive or not, he returned to the sitting-room, and then went to examine the body outside the door.",go find man half window half hold throat suffocate dog take dog desire man secure robber ascertain alive return sitting room go examine body door

94,"""Yes,"" replied Edward, ""he has gone to his account. God forgive him!""",reply go account forgive 
95,"On inquiry they found, that of all the robbers, to the number of ten, not one had escaped--eight they had made prisoners, Corbould, and the man whom the dogs had seized, and who was found to be quite dead, made up the number. The robbers were all bound and guarded; and then, leaving them under the charge of Oswald and five of his men, Edward and Humphrey set off with seven more to Clara's cottage, to ascertain if there were any more to be found there. They arrived by two o'clock in the morning, and, on knocking several times, the door was opened and they seized another man, the only one who was found in it. They then went back to the cottage with their prisoner, and by the time that they had arrived it was daylight. As soon as the party sent by the intendant had been supplied with a breakfast, Edward bade farewell to Humphrey and his sisters, that he might return and deliver up his prisoners. Pablo went with him to bring back the cart which carried the two dead bodies. This capture cleared the forest of the robbers which had so long infested it, for they never had any more attempts made from that time.",inquiry find robber number escape make prisoner man dog seize find dead make number robber bind guard leave charge man set more cottage ascertain be more find arrive o'clock morning knock several time door open seize man only one find go cottage prisoner time arrive daylight party send intendant supply breakfast bid farewell sister return deliver prisoner go bring cart carry dead body capture clear forest robber infest have more attempt make time 
96,"Before Edward left, Humphrey and he examined the box which Humphrey had dug up from under the oak, and which had occasioned such danger to the inmates of the cottage; for one of the men stated to Edward that they suspected that the box which they had seen Humphrey dig out contained treasure, and that without they had seen him in possession of it, they never should have attacked the cottage, although Corbould had often persuaded them so to do; but as they knew that he was only seeking revenge--and they required money to stimulate them--they had refused, as they considered that there was nothing to be obtained in the cottage worth the risk, as they knew that the inmates had firearms, and would defend themselves. On examination of its contents, they found in the box a sum of 40 pounds in gold, a bag of silver, and some other valuables in silver spoons, candlesticks, and ornaments for women. Edward took a list of the contents, and when he returned he stated to the intendant all that had occurred, and requested to know what should be done with the money and other articles which Humphrey had found.",leave examine box dig oak occasion such danger inmate cottage man state suspect box see dig contain treasure see possession attack cottage persuade do know seek revenge require money stimulate refuse consider be obtain cottage worth risk know inmate have firearm defend examination content find box sum pound gold bag silver other valuable silver spoon candlestick ornament woman take list content return state intendant occur request know do money other article find 
97,"""I wish you had said nothing to me about it,"" said the intendant, ""although I am pleased with your open and fair dealing. I can not say any thing, except that you had better let Humphrey keep it till it is claimed--which, of course, it never will be. But, Edward, Humphrey must come over here and make his deposition, as I must report the capture of these robbers, and send them to trial. You had better go with the clerk and take the depositions of Pablo and your sisters, while Humphrey comes here. You can stay till his return. Their depositions are not of so much consequence as Humphrey's, as they can only speak as to the attack, but Humphrey's I must take down myself.""",wish say say intendant pleased open fair deal say thing good let keep claim course come make deposition report capture robber send trial have good go clerk take deposition sister come stay return deposition much consequence speak attack take 
98,"When Patience and Clara heard that Edward was going over, they obtained leave to go with him to see Alice and Edith, and were to be escorted back by Humphrey. This the intendant consented to, and they had a very merry party. Humphrey remained two days at the intendant's house, and then returned to the cottage, where Edward had taken his place during his absence.",hear go obtain leave go see escort intendant consent have merry party remain day intendant house return cottage take place absence
