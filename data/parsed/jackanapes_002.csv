4," The Grey Goose remembered quite well the year that Jackanapes began to walk, for it was the year that the speckled hen for the first time in all her motherly life got out of patience when she was sitting. She had been rather proud of the eggs--they are unusually large--but she never felt quite comfortable on them; and whether it was because she used to get cramp, and got off the nest, or because the season was bad, or what, she never could tell, but every egg was addled but one, and the one that did hatch gave her more trouble than any chick she had ever reared.",remember year begin walk year speckle hen first time motherly life get patience sit proud egg large feel comfortable use get cramp get nest season bad tell egg addle one hatch give more trouble chick rear 
5,"It was a fine, downy, bright yellow little thing, but it had a monstrous big nose and feet, and such an ungainly walk as she knew no other instance of in her well-bred and high-stepping family. And as to behavior, it was not that it was either quarrelsome or moping, but simply unlike the rest. When the other chicks hopped and cheeped on the Green all at their mother's feet, this solitary yellow one went waddling off on its own responsibility, and do or cluck what the spreckled hen would, it went to play in the pond.",fine downy bright yellow little thing have monstrous big nose foot ungainly walk know other instance breed high step family behavior quarrelsome mope rest other chick hopp cheep mother foot solitary yellow one go waddle own responsibility do cluck spreckled hen go play pond 
6,"It was off one day as usual, and the hen was fussing and fuming after it, when the Postman, going to deliver a letter at Miss Jessamine's door, was nearly knocked over by the good lady herself, who, bursting out of the house with her cap just off and her bonnet just not on, fell into his arms, crying--",day usual hen fuss fume go deliver letter door knock good lady burst house cap bonnet fall arm cry

8,"If the Postman loved anything on earth, he loved the Captain's yellow-haired child, so propping Miss Jessamine against her own door-post, he followed the direction of her trembling fingers and made for the Green.",love earth love yellow haired child prop own door post follow direction tremble finger make 
9,"Jackanapes had had the start of the Postman by nearly ten minutes. The world--the round green world with an oak tree on it--was just becoming very interesting to him. He had tried, vigorously but ineffectually, to mount a passing pig the last time he was taken out walking; but then he was encumbered with a nurse. Now he was his own master, and might, by courage and energy, become the master of that delightful, downy, dumpy, yellow thing, that was bobbing along over the green grass in front of him. Forward! Charge! He aimed well, and grabbed it, but only to feel the delicious downiness and dumpiness slipping through his fingers as he fell upon his face. ""Quawk!"" said the yellow thing, and wobbled off sideways. It was this oblique movement that enabled Jackanapes to come up with it, for it was bound for the Pond, and therefore obliged to come back into line. He failed again from top-heaviness, and his prey escaped sideways as before, and, as before, lost ground in getting back to the direct road to the Pond.",have start minute world round green world oak tree become interesting try mount pass pig last time take walk encumber nurse own master courage energy become master delightful downy dumpy yellow thing bob green grass front charge aim grab feel delicious downiness dumpiness slip finger fall face say yellow thing wobble oblique movement enable come bind oblige come line fail top heaviness prey escape lose ground get direct road 
10," And at the Pond the Postman found them both, one yellow thing rocking safely on the ripples that lie beyond duck-weed, and the other washing his draggled frock with tears, because he too had tried to sit upon the Pond, and it wouldn't hold him.",find yellow thing rock ripple lie duck weed other wash draggle frock tear try sit hold
