1,CHAPTER I. SHOWS HOW THE ROYAL FAMILY SATE DOWN TO BREAKFAST,chapter i. show royal family sate breakfast 
2,"This is Valoroso XXIV., King of Paflagonia, seated with his Queen and only child at their royal breakfast-table, and receiving the letter which announces to His Majesty a proposed visit from Prince Bulbo, heir of Padella, reigning King of Crim Tartary. Remark the delight upon the monarch’s royal features. He is so absorbed in the perusal of the King of Crim Tartary’s letter, that he allows his eggs to get cold, and leaves his august muffins untasted.",seat only child royal breakfast table receive letter announce propose visit heir reign remark delight monarch royal feature absorb perusal letter allow egg get cold leave august muffin untasted 
3,"‘What! that wicked, brave, delightful Prince Bulbo!’ cries Princess Angelica; ‘so handsome, so accomplished, so witty--the conqueror of Rimbombamento, where he slew ten thousand giants!’",wicked brave delightful cry handsome accomplish witty conqueror slew giant 
4,"‘Who told you of him, my dear?’ asks His Majesty.",tell dear ask 
5,"‘A little bird,’ says Angelica.",little bird say 
6,"‘Poor Giglio!’ says mamma, pouring out the tea.",poor say mamma pour tea 
7,"‘Bother Giglio!’ cries Angelica, tossing up her head, which rustled with a thousand curl-papers.",bother cry toss head rustle curl paper 
8,"‘I wish,’ growls the King--‘I wish Giglio was. . .’",wish growl wish 
9,"‘Was better? Yes, dear, he is better,’ says the Queen. ‘Angelica’s little maid, Betsinda, told me so when she came to my room this morning with my early tea.’",good dear good say little maid tell come room morning early tea 
10,"‘You are always drinking tea,’ said the monarch, with a scowl.",drink tea say monarch scowl 
11,‘It is better than drinking port or brandy and water;’ replies Her Majesty.,good drink port brandy water reply 
12,"‘Well, well, my dear, I only said you were fond of drinking tea,’ said the King of Paflagonia, with an effort as if to command his temper. ‘Angelica! I hope you have plenty of new dresses; your milliners’ bills are long enough. My dear Queen, you must see and have some parties. I prefer dinners, but of course you will be for balls. Your everlasting blue velvet quite tires me: and, my love, I should like you to have a new necklace. Order one. Not more than a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand pounds.’",dear say fond drink tea say effort command temper hope have plenty new dress milliner bill long dear see have party prefer dinner course ball everlasting blue velvet tire love like have new necklace order more pound 
13,"‘And Giglio, dear?’ says the Queen.",dear say 
14,‘GIGLIO MAY GO TO THE--’,go 
15,"‘Oh, sir,’ screams Her Majesty. ‘Your own nephew! our late King’s only son.’",sir scream own nephew late only son 
16,"‘Giglio may go to the tailor’s, and order the bills to be sent in to Glumboso to pay. Confound him! I mean bless his dear heart. He need want for nothing; give him a couple of guineas for pocket-money, my dear; and you may as well order yourself bracelets while you are about the necklace, Mrs. V.’",go tailor order bill send pay confound mean bless dear heart need want give couple guinea pocket money dear order bracelet necklace 
17,"Her Majesty, or MRS. V., as the monarch facetiously called her (for even royalty will have its sport, and this august family were very much attached), embraced her husband, and, twining her arm round her daughter’s waist, they quitted the breakfast-room in order to make all things ready for the princely stranger.",monarch call royalty have sport family attach embrace husband twin arm daughter waist quit breakfast room order make thing ready princely stranger 
18,"When they were gone, the smile that had lighted up the eyes of the HUSBAND and FATHER fled--the pride of the KING fled--the MAN was alone. Had I the pen of a G. P. R. James, I would describe Valoroso’s torments in the choicest language; in which I would also depict his flashing eye, his distended nostril--his dressing-gown, pocket-handkerchief, and boots. But I need not say I have NOT the pen of that novelist; suffice it to say, Valoroso was alone.",gone smile light eye husband father flead pride flead alone pen describe torment choicest language depict flash eye distend nostril dress gown pocket handkerchief boot say have pen novelist suffice say alone 
19,"He rushed to the cupboard, seizing from the table one of the many egg-cups with which his princely board was served for the matin meal, drew out a bottle of right Nantz or Cognac, filled and emptied the cup several times, and laid it down with a hoarse ‘Ha, ha, ha! now Valoroso is a man again!’",rush cupboard seize table many egg cup princely board serve matin meal draw bottle right fill empty cup several time lay hoarse man 
20,"‘But oh!’ he went on (still sipping, I am sorry to say), ‘ere I was a king, I needed not this intoxicating draught; once I detested the hot brandy wine, and quaffed no other fount but nature’s rill. It dashes not more quickly o’er the rocks than I did, as, with blunderbuss in hand, I brushed away the early morning dew, and shot the partridge, snipe, or antlered deer! Ah! well may England’s dramatist remark, “Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown!” Why did I steal my nephew’s, my young Giglio’s--? Steal! said I? no, no, no, not steal, not steal. Let me withdraw that odious expression. I took, and on my manly head I set, the royal crown of Paflagonia; I took, and with my royal arm I wield, the sceptral rod of Paflagonia; I took, and in my outstretched hand I hold, the royal orb of Paflagonia! Could a poor boy, a snivelling, drivelling boy--was in his nurse’s arms but yesterday, and cried for sugarplums and puled for pap--bear up the awful weight of crown, orb, sceptre? gird on the sword my royal fathers wore, and meet in fight the tough Crimean foe?’",go sip sorry say king need intoxicating draught detest hot brandy wine quaff other fount nature rill dash rock blunderbuss hand brush early morning dew shoot partridge snipe antlered deer dramatist remark uneasy lie head wear crown steal nephew young steal say steal steal let withdraw odious expression take manly head set royal crown take royal arm wield sceptral rod take outstretched hand hold royal orb poor boy snivelling drivelling boy nurse arm yesterday cry sugarplum pul pap bear awful weight crown orb sceptre gird sword royal father wear meet fight tough crimean foe 
21,"And then the monarch went on to argue in his own mind (though we need not say that blank verse is not argument) that what he had got it was his duty to keep, and that, if at one time he had entertained ideas of a certain restitution, which shall be nameless, the prospect by a CERTAIN MARRIAGE of uniting two crowns and two nations which had been engaged in bloody and expensive wars, as the Paflagonians and the Crimeans had been, put the idea of Giglio’s restoration to the throne out of the question: nay, were his own brother, King Savio, alive, he would certainly will the crown from his own son in order to bring about such a desirable union.",monarch go argue own mind say blank verse argument get duty keep time entertain idea certain restitution nameless prospect certain unite crown nation engage bloody expensive war put idea restoration throne question own brother alive crown own son order bring desirable union 
22,"Thus easily do we deceive ourselves! Thus do we fancy what we wish is right! The King took courage, read the papers, finished his muffins and eggs, and rang the bell for his Prime Minister. The Queen, after thinking whether she should go up and see Giglio, who had been sick, thought ‘Not now. Business first; pleasure afterwards. I will go and see dear Giglio this afternoon; and now I will drive to the jeweller’s, to look for the necklace and bracelets.’ The Princess went up into her own room, and made Betsinda, her maid, bring out all her dresses; and as for Giglio, they forgot him as much as I forget what I had for dinner last Tuesday twelve-month.",deceive fancy wish right take courage read paper finish muffin egg ring bell prime think go see sick think business pleasure go see dear afternoon drive jeweller look necklace bracelet go own room make maid bring dress forget much forget have dinner last month
