2," When the service was ended the minister descended the pulpit steps just as Daniel was about to hurry Jessica away, and taking her by the hand in the face of all the congregation he led her into the vestry, whither Jane and Winny quickly followed them. He was fatigued with the services of the day, and his pale face was paler than ever, as he placed Jessica before his chair, into which he threw himself with an air of exhaustion; but bowing his head upon his hands he said, in a low but clear tone, “Lord, these are the lambs of thy flock. Help me to feed thy lambs!”",service end minister descend pulpit step about hurry take hand face congregation lead vestry follow fatigue service day pale face paler place chair throw air exhaustion bow head hand say low clear tone lamb flock help feed lamb
