There were two persons in the room--a young lady, who sat drawing at the round table, and a youth, lying on a couch near the fire, surrounded with books and newspapers, and a pair of crutches near him. Both looked up with a smile of welcome at the entrance of a tall, fine-looking young man, whom each greeted with ‘Good morning, Philip.’",draw room favour apartment peculiar air home seem reside see middle summer large window open garden story commence bright fire stand fragrant green house plant contrast wintry fog leafless tree be person room young lady sit draw round table youth lie couch fire surround book newspaper pair crutch look smile welcome entrance tall fine look young man greet good morning

His father was very much offended, and there was much dreadfully violent conduct on each side. At last, the young man was driven to seek a reconciliation. He brought his wife to Moorworth, and rode to Redclyffe, to have an interview with his father. Unhappily, Sir Guy was giving a dinner to the hunt, and had been drinking. He not only refused to see him, but I am afraid he used shocking language, and said something about bidding him go back to his fiddling brother in-law.
