4," The football field was a large one, bounded on two sides by tall wooden palings, and on the other two by a hedge and a new shingled road, separated from the field by a post and rails.",football field large one bound side tall wooden paling other hedge new shingle road separate field post rail 
5,"Two of the younger boys, proud of their office, raced down to the further end to set up the goal-posts. The rest lounged idly about without attempting to begin operations, except the new boy Kiffin, who was seen walking apart from the rest, diligently studying the ""rules of the game of football,"" as laid down in a small _Boy's Own Pocket Book and Manual of Outdoor Sports_, with which he had been careful to provide himself.",young boy proud office race further end set goal post rest lounge attempt begin operation new boy see walk rest study rule game football lay small own outdoor careful provide 
6,"At last Tipping suggested that they had better begin, and proposed that Mr. Blinkhorn and himself should toss up for the choice of sides, and this being done, Mr. Bultitude presently, to his great dismay, heard his name mentioned. ""I'll have young Bultitude,"" said Tipping; ""he used to play up decently. Look here, you young beggar, you're on my side, and if you don't play up it will be the worse for you!""",last suggest begin propose toss choice side do great dismay hear name mention have young say use play look young beggar side play bad 
7,"It was not worth while, however, to protest, since he would so soon be rid of the whole crew for ever, and so Paul followed Tipping and his train with dutiful submission, and the game began.",worth while protest rid whole crew follow train dutiful submission game begin 
8,"It was not a spirited performance. Mr. Tinkler, who was not an athlete, retired at once to the post and rails, on which he settled himself to enjoy a railway novel with a highly stimulating cover. Mr. Blinkhorn, who had more conscientious views of his office, charged about vigorously, performing all kinds of wonders with the ball, though evidently more from a sense of duty than with any idea of enjoyment.",spirit performance athlete retire post rail settle enjoy railway novel stimulate cover have more conscientious view office charge perform kind wonder ball more sense duty idea enjoyment 
9,"Tipping occasionally took the trouble to oppose him, but as a concession merely, and with a parade of being under no necessity to do so; and these two, with a very small following of enthusiasts on either side, waged a private and confidential kind of warfare in different parts of the field, while the others made no pretence of playing for the present, but strolled about in knots, exchanging and bartering the treasures valuable in the sight of schoolboys, and gossiping generally.",tipping take trouble oppose concession parade necessity do small follow enthusiast side wage private confidential kind warfare different part field other make pretence play present stroll knot exchang barter treasure valuable sight schoolboy gossipe 
10,"As for Paul, he did not clearly understand what ""playing up"" might mean. He had not indulged in football since he was a genuine boy, and then only in a rudimentary and primitive form, and without any particular fondness for the exercise. But being now, in spirit at all events, a precise elderly person, with a decided notion of taking care of himself, he was resolved that not even Tipping should compel him to trust his person within range of that dirty brown globe, which whistled past his ear or seemed spinning towards his stomach with such a hideous suggestion of a cannon-ball about it.",understand play mean indulge football genuine boy rudimentary primitive form particular fondness exercise spirit event precise elderly person decide notion take care resolve compel trust person range dirty brown globe whistle ear seem spinn stomach hideous suggestion can non ball 
11,"All the ghastly instances, too, of accidents to life and limb in the football field came unpleasantly into his memory, and he saw the inadvisability of mingling with the crowd and allowing himself to be kicked violently on the shins.",ghastly instance accident life limb football field come memory see inadvisability mingle crowd allow kick shin 
12,"So he trotted industriously about at a safe distance in order to allay suspicion, while waiting for a good opportunity to put his scheme of escape into execution.",trotet safe distance order allay suspicion wait good opportunity put scheme escape execution 
13,"At last he could wait no longer, for the fearful thought occurred to him, that if he remained there much longer, the Doctor--who, as he knew from Dick, always came to superintend, if not to share the sports of his pupils--might make his appearance, and then his chance would be lost for the present, for he knew too well that he should never find courage to ask permission from _him_.",last wait fearful thought occur remain know come superintend share sport pupil make appearance chance lose present know find courage ask permission 
14,"With a beating heart he went up to Mr. Tinkler, who was still on the fence with his novel, and asked as humbly as he could bring himself to do:",beating heart go fence novel ask bring do

21,"Mr. Tinkler stared, as well he might, but making nothing of it, and being chiefly anxious not to be interrupted any longer, only said, ""Oh, well, don't bother me; I daresay it's all right. Cut along!""",stare make anxious interrupt say bother daresay right cut 
22,"So Mr. Bultitude was free; the path lay open to him now. He knew he would have little difficulty in finding his way to the station, and, once there, he would have the whole afternoon in which to wait for a train to town.",free path lay open know have little difficulty find way station have whole afternoon wait train town 
23,"""I've managed that excellently,"" he thought, as he ran blithely off, almost like the boy he seemed. ""Not the slightest hitch. I defy the fates themselves to stop me now!""",manage think run boy seem slight hitch defy fate stop 
24,"But the fates are ladies, and--not of course that it follows--occasionally spiteful. It is very rash indeed to be ungallant enough to defy them--they have such an unpleasant habit of accepting the challenge.",fate lady course follow spiteful rash ungallant defy have unpleasant habit accept challenge 
25,"Mr. Bultitude had hardly got clear of the groups scattered about the field, when he met a small flaxen-haired boy, who was just coming down to join the game. It was Porter, his neighbour of the German lesson.",get clear group scatter field meet small flaxen haired boy come join game neighbour german lesson

28,"""Another time won't do,"" said little Porter, laying hold of him by his jacket. ""I want that rabbit.""",time do say little lay hold jacket want rabbit 
29,"This outrageous demand took Mr. Bultitude's breath away. He had no idea what rabbit was referred to, or why he should be required to produce such an animal at a moment's notice. This was the second time an inconvenient small boy had interfered between him and liberty. He would not be baffled twice. He tried to shake off his persecutor.",outrageous demand take breath have idea rabbit refer require produce animal moment notice second time inconvenient small boy interfer liberty baffle try shake persecutor

40,"""It isn't in your playbox, I know,"" put in Siggers: ""because I saw it turned out yesterday and there was no rabbit then. Besides, how could a rabbit live in a playbox? He's telling lies. I can see it by his face. He hasn't any rabbit!""",playbox know put see turn yesterday be rabbit rabbit live playbox tell lie see face rabbit 
41,"""Of course I haven't!"" said Mr. Bultitude. ""How should I? I'm not a conjurer. It's not a habit of mine to go about with rabbits concealed on my person. What's the use of coming to me like this? It's absurd, you know; perfectly absurd!""",course say conjurer habit go rabbit conceal person use come absurd know absurd 
42,"The crowd increased until there was quite a ring formed round Mr. Bultitude and the indignant claimant, and presently Tipping came bustling up.",crowd increase be ring form indignant claimant come bustle

46,"Mr. Bultitude was of course exceedingly annoyed by this unlooked-for interruption, and still more by such utterly preposterous claims on him for animals; however, it was easy to explain that he had no such things in his possession, and after that of course no more could be said. He was beginning to disclaim all liability, when Siggers stopped him.",course annoy unlooked interruption more such preposterous claim animal easy explain have such thing possession course more say begin disclaim liability stop

48,"He fixed upon the goal-posts as being somehow more formal, and, as his proposal was well received, two of them grasped Mr. Bultitude by the collar and dragged him along in procession to the appointed spot between the two flags, while Siggers followed in what he conceived to be a highly judicial manner, and evidently enjoying himself prodigiously.",fix goal post formal proposal receive grasp collar drag procession appoint spot flag follow conceive judicial manner enjoy 
49,"Paul, though highly indignant, allowed himself to be led along without resistance. It was safest to humour them, for after all it would not last long, and when they were tired of baiting him he could watch his time and slip quietly away.",indignant allow lead resistance safe humour last tired bait watch time slip 
50,"When they reached the goal-posts Siggers arranged them in a circle, placing himself, the hapless Paul, and his accusers in the centre. ""You chaps had better all be jurymen,"" he said. ""I'll be judge, and unless he makes a clean breast of it,"" he added with judicial impartiality, ""the court will jolly well punch his ugly young head off.""",reach goal post arrange circle place hapless accuser centre chap have good jurymen say judge make clean breast add judicial impartiality court punch ugly young head 
51,"Siggers' father was an Old Bailey barrister in good and rather sharp practice, so that it was clearly the son's mission to preside on this occasion. But unfortunately his hour of office was doomed to be a brief one, for Mr. Blinkhorn, becoming aware that the game was being still more scantily supported, and noticing the crowd at the goal, came up to know the reason of it at a long camel-like trot, his hat on the back of his head, his mild face flushed with exertion, and his pebble glasses gleaming in the winter sunshine.",father old barrister good sharp practice son mission preside occasion hour office doom brief one become aware game support notice crowd goal come know reason long camel like trot hat back head mild face flush exertion pebble glasses gleam winter sunshine

55,"On the whole, perhaps, Mr. Bultitude was glad of this interference. At least justice would be done now, although this usher had blundered so unpardonably that morning.",whole glad interference least justice do usher blunder morning

65,"""Please, sir,"" said Porter, ""he told me last term he had a lot of rabbits at home, and if I liked he would bring me back a lop-eared one and let me have it cheap, and I gave him two shillings, sir, and sixpence for a hutch to keep it in; and now he pretends he doesn't know anything about it!""",sir say tell last term have lot rabbit home like bring lop eare let have cheap give shilling sir sixpence hutch keep pretend know 
66,"To Paul's horror two or three other boys came forward with much the same tale. He remembered now that during the holidays he had discovered that Dick was maintaining a sort of amateur menagerie in his bedroom, and that he had ordered the whole of the livestock to be got rid of or summarily destroyed.",horror other boy come much same tale remember holiday discover maintain sort amateur menagerie bedroom order whole livestock get rid destroy 
67,"Now it seemed that the wretched Dick had already disposed of it to these clamorous boys, and, what was worse, had stipulated with considerable forethought for payment in advance. For the first time he repented his paternal harshness. Like the netted lion, a paltry white mouse or two would have set him free; but, less happy than the beast in the fable, he had not one!",seem wretch dispose clamorous boy bad stipulate considerable forethought payment advance first time repent paternal harshness nett lion paltry white mouse set free happy beast fable have

69,"""None of your long words, now,"" growled Tipping. (Boys hate long words as much as even a Saturday Reviewer.) ""Why haven't you brought the rabbits?""",long word growl tipping boy hate long word much bring rabbit 
70,"""Yes,"" said Mr. Blinkhorn. ""Why, having promised to bring the rabbits with you, haven't you kept your word? You must be able to give some explanation.""",say promise bring rabbit keep word able give explanation 
71,"""Because,"" said Mr. Bultitude, wriggling with embarrassment, ""I--that is my father--found out that my young rascal of a son--I mean his young rascal of a son (_me_, you know) was, contrary to my express orders, keeping a couple of abominable rabbits in his bedroom, and a quantity of filthy little white mice which he tried to train to climb up the banisters. And I kept finding the brutes running about my bath-room, and--well, of course, I put a stop to it; and--no, what am I saying?--my father, of course, he put a stop to it; and, in point of fact, had them all drowned in a pail of water.""",say wriggle embarrassment father find young rascal son mean young rascal son know contrary express order keep couple abominable rabbit bedroom quantity filthy little white mouse try train climb banister keep find brute run bath room course put stop say father course put stop point fact have drown pail water 
72,"It might be thought that he had an excellent opportunity here of avowing himself, but there was the risk that Mr. Blinkhorn would disbelieve him, and, with the boys, he felt that the truth would do anything but increase his popularity. But dissembling fails sometimes outside the copy-books, and Mr. Bultitude's rather blundering attempt at it only landed him in worse difficulties.",think have excellent opportunity avow be risk disbelieve boy feel truth do increase popularity dissembling fail copy book blunder attempt land bad difficulty 
73,"There was a yell of rage and disappointment from the defrauded ones, who had cherished a lingering hope that young Bultitude had those rabbits somewhere, but (like Mr. Barkis and his wooden lemon) found himself unable to part with them when the time came to fulfil his contract. And as contempt is a frame of mind highly stimulating to one's self-esteem, even those who had no personal interest in the matter joined in the execrations with hearty goodwill and sympathy.",be yell rage disappointment defraud one cherish linger hope young have rabbit wooden lemon find unable part time come fulfil contract contempt frame mind stimulate self esteem have personal interest matter join execration hearty goodwill sympathy 
74,"""Why did you let him do it? They were ours, not his. What right had your governor to go and drown our rabbits, eh?"" they cried wrathfully.",let do right have governor go drown rabbit cry

76,"But this only made them angrier, and they resented his defence with hoots, and groans, and hisses.",make angry resent defence hoot groan hiss 
77,"Mr. Blinkhorn meanwhile was pondering the affair conscientiously. At last he said, ""But you know the Doctor would never allow animals to be kept in the school, if Bultitude had brought them. The whole thing is against the rules, and I shall not interfere.""",ponder affair last say know allow animal keep school bring whole thing rule interfere

84,"One boy after another brought forward his claim. One had entrusted Dick, it appeared, with a shilling, for which he was to receive a mouse with a ""plum saddle,"" and two others had invested ninepence each in white mice. With Porter's half-crown, the total came to precisely five shillings--all Paul had in the world, the one rope by which he could ever hope to haul himself up to his lost pinnacle!",boy bring claim entrust appear shilling receive mouse plum saddle other invest ninepence white mouse half crown total come shilling have world rope hope haul lose pinnacle 
85,"Mr. Blinkhorn, naturally enough, saw no reason why the money, being clearly due, should not be paid at once. ""Give me any money you have about you, Bultitude,"" he said, ""and I'll satisfy your debts with it, as far as it goes.""",see reason money due pay give money have say satisfy debt go 
86,"Paul clasped his arm convulsively. ""No!"" he cried hoarsely, ""not that! Don't make me do that! I--I can't pay them--not now. They don't understand.

He tried to save himself by flight, and with a violent plunge broke through the circle and made for the road which led towards the station.",despair do fatal thing possible try save flight violent plunge break circle make road lead station 
90,"Instantly the whole school, only too glad of the excitement, was at his heels. The unhappy Colonial Produce merchant ran as he had not run for a quarter of a century, faster even than he had on his first experience of Coggs' and Coker's society on that memorable Monday night. But in spite of his efforts the chase was a short one. Chawner and Tipping very soon had him by the collar, and brought him back, struggling and kicking out viciously, to Mr. Blinkhorn, whose good opinion he had now lost for ever.",whole school glad excitement heel unhappy colonial produce merchant run run quarter century fast have first experience society memorable night spite effort chase short one have collar bring struggle kick good opinion lose

Ten minutes before, and freedom was within his grasp, and now it had eluded him and was as hopelessly out of reach as ever!",leave field mockery permission get distance more mile penny pocket minute freedom grasp elude reach 
97,"No one pitied him; no one understood the real extent of his loss. Mr. Blinkhorn and the few enthusiasts went back to their unobtrusive game, while the rest of the school discussed the affair in groups, the popular indignation against young Bultitude's hitherto unsuspected meanness growing more marked every instant.",pity understand real extent loss few enthusiast go unobtrusive game rest school discuss affair group popular indignation young unsuspected meanness grow mark instant 
98,"It might have even taken some decided and objectionable form before long, but when it was at its height there was a sudden cry of alarm.

99,"Mr. Bultitude felt almost cheered. This coming to join his pupils' sports showed a good heart; the Doctor would almost certainly be in a good humour, and he cheated himself into believing that, at some interval in the game, he might perhaps find courage to draw near and seek to interest him in his incredible woes.",feel cheer come join pupil sport show good heart good humour cheat believe interval game find courage draw seek interest incredible woe 
100,"It was quite extraordinary to see how the game, which had hitherto decidedly languished and hung fire, now quickened into briskness and became positively spirited. Everyone developed a hearty interest in it, and it would almost seem as if the boys, with more delicacy than they are generally credited with, were unwilling to let their master guess how little his indulgence was really appreciated. Even Mr. Tinkler, whose novel had kept him spell-bound on his rail all through the recent excitement, now slipped it hurriedly into his pocket and rushed energetically into the fray, shouting encouragement rather indiscriminately to either side, till he had an opportunity of finding out privately to which leader he had been assigned.",extraordinary see game languish hang fire quicken briskness become spirit develop hearty interest seem boy more delicacy credit unwilling let master guess little indulgence appreciate novel keep spell bind rail recent excitement slip pocket rush fray shouting encouragement side have opportunity find leader assign 
101,"Dr. Grimstone came down the field at a majestic slow trot, calling out to the players as he came on--""Well done, Mutlow! Finely played, sir! Dribble it along now. Ah, you're afraid of it! Run into it, sir, run into it! No running with the ball now, Siggers; play without those petty meannesses, or leave the game!

102,"And, as the ball had rolled in his direction, he punted it up in an exceedingly dignified manner, the whole school keeping respectfully apart, until he had brought it to a reasonable distance from the goal, when he kicked it through with great solemnity, amidst faint, and it is to be feared somewhat sycophantic applause, and turned away with the air of a man surfeited of success.",ball roll direction punt dignified manner whole school keep bring reasonable distance goal kick great solemnity faint fear sycophantic applause turn air man surfeit success 
103,"""For which side did I win that?"" he asked presently, whereupon Tipping explained that his side had been the favoured one.

105,"The other side too looked unhappy, feeling themselves in a position of extreme delicacy and embarrassment. For if they played their best, they ran some risk of offending the Doctor, or, what was worse, drawing him over into their ranks; while if, on the other hand, they allowed themselves to be too easily worsted, they might be suspected of sulkiness and temper--offences which he was very ready to discover and resent.",other side look unhappy feel position extreme delicacy embarrassment play good run risk offend bad draw rank other hand allow worst suspect sulkiness temper offence ready discover resent 
106,"Dr. Grimstone for his part enjoyed the exercise, and had no idea that he was not a thoroughly welcome and valued playmate. But though it was pleasant to outsiders to see a schoolmaster permitting himself to share in the recreation of his pupils, it must be owned that to the latter the advantages of the arrangement seemed something more than dubious.",part enjoy exercise have idea welcome value playmate pleasant outsider see schoolmaster permitt share recreation pupil own latter advantage arrangement seem more dubious 
107,"Mr. Bultitude, being on the side adopted by the Doctor, found too soon that he was expected to bestir himself. More than ever anxious now to conciliate, he did his very best to conquer his natural repugnance and appear more interested than alarmed as the ball came in his way; but although (in boating slang) he ""sugared"" with some adroitness, he was promptly found out, for his son had been a dashing and plucky player.",side adopt find expect bestir more anxious conciliate do very good conquer natural repugnance appear interested alarm ball come way boating slang sugare adroitness find son dash plucky player
