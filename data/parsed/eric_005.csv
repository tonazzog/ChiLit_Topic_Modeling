3,"The second term at school is generally the great test of the strength of a boy's principles and resolutions. During the first term the novelty, the loneliness, the dread of unknown punishments, the respect for authorities, the desire to measure himself with his companions--all tend to keep him right and diligent. But many of these incentives are removed after the first brush of novelty, and many a lad who has given good promise at first, turns out, after a short probation, idle, or vicious, or indifferent.",second term school great test strength boy principle resolution first term novelty loneliness dread unknown punishment respect authority desire measure companion tend keep right diligent many incentive remove first brush novelty many lad give good promise first turn short probation idle vicious indifferent 
4,"But there was little comparative danger for Eric, so long as he continued to be a home boarder, which was for another half-year. On the contrary, he was anxious to support in his new remove the prestige of having been head boy; and as he still continued under Mr. Gordon, he really wished to turn over a new leaf in his conduct towards him, and recover, if possible, his lost esteem.",be little comparative danger continue home border half year contrary anxious support new remove prestige head boy continue wish turn new leaf conduct recover possible lose esteem 
5,"His popularity was a fatal snare. He enjoyed and was very proud of it, and was half inclined to be angry with Russell for not fully sharing his feelings; but Russell had a far larger experience of school life than his new friend, and dreaded with all his heart lest ""he should follow a multitude to do evil.""",popularity fatal snare enjoy proud half inclined angry share feeling have large experience school life new friend dread heart follow multitude do evil 
6,"The ""cribbing,"" which had astonished and pained Eric at first, was more flagrant than even in the Upper Fourth, and assumed a chronic form. In all the repetition lessons one of the boys used to write out in a large hand the passage to be learnt by heart, and dexterously pin it to the front of Mr. Gordon's desk. There any boy who chose could read it off with little danger of detection, and, as before, the only boys who refused to avail themselves of this trickery were Eric, Russell, and Owen.",cribbing astonished pain flagrant upper fourth assume chronic form repetition lesson boy use write large hand passage learn heart pin front desk boy choose read little danger detection only boy refuse avail trickery 
7,"Eric did _not_ yield to it; never once did he suffer his eyes to glance at the paper when his turn to repeat came round. But although this was the case, he never spoke against the practice to the other boys, even when he lost places by it. Nay more, he would laugh when any one told him how he had escaped ""skewing"" (_i.e._ being turned) by reading it off; and he even went so far as to allow them to suppose that he wouldn't himself object to take advantage of the master's unsuspicious confidence.",_not_ yield suffer eye glance paper turn repeat come case speak practice other boy lose place more laugh one tell escape skewing turn read go allow suppose object take advantage master unsuspicious confidence

13,"""Well, I don't much care. At any rate I'll chance it."" And off the boys ran to the racquet-court, Eric intending to occupy the last quarter of an hour before school-time in learning his lesson. Russell and he stood the other two, and they were very well matched. They had finished two splendid games, and each side had been victorious in turn, when Duncan, in the highest spirits, shouted, ""Now, Russell, for the conqueror.""",care rate chance boy run racquet court intend occupy last quarter hour school time learn lesson stand other match finish splendid game side victorious turn high spirit shout conqueror 
14,"""Get some one else in my place,"" said Russell; ""I don't know my Rep., and must cut and learn it.""",get one else place say know cut learn

17,"""O ay, I forgot. Well, after all, you're quite right; I only wish I was as good.""",forget right wish good

20,"""O no! don't go; there's Llewellyn; he'll take Russell's place, and we _must_ have the conquering game.""",go be take place have conquer game 
21,"Again Eric yielded; and when the clock struck he ran into school, hot, vexed with himself, and certain to break down, just as Russell strolled in, whispering, ""I've had lots of time to get up the Horace, and know it pat.""",yield clock strike run school hot vex certain break stroll whisper have lot time get know pat 
22,"Still he clung to the little thistledown of hope that he should have plenty of time to cram it before the form were called up. But another temptation awaited him. No sooner was he seated than Graham whispered, ""Williams, it's your turn to write out the Horace; I did last time, you know.""",cling little thistledown hope have plenty time cram form call temptation await seat whisper turn write do last time know 
23,"Poor Eric. He was reaping the fruits of his desire to keep up popularity, by never denying his complicity in the general cheating. Everybody seemed to assume now that _he_ at any rate didn't think much of it, and he had never claimed his real right up to that time of asserting his innocence. But this was a step further than he had ever gone before. He drew back--",poor reap fruit desire keep popularity deny complicity general cheating seem assume _he_ rate think much claim real right time assert innocence step go draw

30,"""Here, I'll do it,"" said Eric suddenly; ""shy us the paper.""",do say shy paper 
31,"His conscience smote him bitterly. In his silly dread of giving offence, he was doing what he heartily despised, and he felt most uncomfortable.",conscience smeat silly dread give offence do despise feel uncomfortable

33,"Just as he finished they were called up, and Barker, taking the paper, succeeded in pinning it as usual on the front of the desk. Eric had never seen it done so carelessly and clumsily before, and firmly believed, what was indeed a fact, that Barker had done it badly on purpose, in the hope that it might be discovered, and so Eric be got once more into a scrape. He was in an agony of apprehension, and when put on, was totally unable to say a word of his Rep. But low as he had fallen, he would not cheat like the rest; he kept his eyes resolutely turned away from the guilty paper, and even refused to repeat the words which were prompted in his ear by the boys on each side. Mr. Gordon, after waiting a moment, said--",finish call take paper succeed pin usual front desk see do believe fact do purpose hope discover get scrape agony apprehension put unable say word rep low fall cheat rest keep eye turn guilty paper refuse repeat word prompt ear boy side wait moment say

36,"It happened that during the lesson the fire began to smoke, and Mr. Gordon told Owen to open the window for a moment. No sooner was this done than the mischievous whiff of sea air which entered the room began to trifle and coquet with the perdulous half sheet pinned in front of the desk, causing thereby an unwonted little pattering crepitation. In alarm, Duncan thoughtlessly pulled out the pin, and immediately the paper floated gracefully over Russell's head, as he sat at the top of the form, and, after one or two gyrations, fluttered down in the centre of the room.",happen lesson fire begin smoke tell open window moment do mischievous whiff sea air enter room begin trifle coquet perdulous half sheet pinn front desk cause unwonted little patter crepitation alarm pull pin paper float head sit top form gyration flutter centre room

39,"""Did you hear? fetch me that half sheet of paper.""",hear fetch half sheet paper 
40,"A boy picked it up and handed it to him. He held it for a full minute in his hands without a word, while vexation, deep disgust, and rising anger struggled in his countenance. At last, he suddenly turned full on Eric, whose writing he recognized, and broke out,",boy pick hand hold full minute hand word vexation deep disgust rise anger struggle countenance last turn full writing recognize break 
41,"""So, Sir! a second time caught in gross deceit. I should not have thought it possible. Your face and manners belie you. You have lost my confidence forever. I _despise_ you.""",second time catch gross deceit think possible face manners belie lose confidence _despise 
42,"""Indeed, Sir,"" said the penitent Eric, ""I never meant--""",say penitent mean 
43,"""Silence--you are detected, as cheats always will be. I shall report you to Dr. Rowlands.""",silence detect cheat report

45,"Mr. Gordon's face grew blacker and blacker. The deep undisguised pain which the discovery caused him was swallowed up in unbounded indignation. ""False-hearted, dishonorable boys,"" he exclaimed, ""henceforth my treatment of you shall be very different. The whole form, except Russell and Owen, shall have an extra lesson every half-holiday; not one of the rest of you will I trust again. I took you for gentlemen. I was mistaken. Go."" And so saying, he waved them to their seats with imperious disdain.",face grow blacker blacker deep undisguised pain discovery cause swallow unbounded indignation false hearted dishonorable boy exclaim treatment different whole form have extra lesson half holiday rest trust take gentleman mistaken go say wave seat imperious disdain 
46,"They went, looking sheepish, and ashamed. Eric, deeply vexed, kept twisting and untwisting a bit of paper, without raising his eyes, and even Barker thoroughly repented his short-sighted treachery; the rest were silent and miserable.",go look sheepish ashamed vex keep twist untwist bit paper raise eye repent short sight treachery rest silent miserable 
47,"At twelve o'clock two boys lingered in the room to speak to Mr. Gordon; they were Eric Williams and Edwin Russell, but they were full of very different feelings.",o'clock boy linger room speak full different feeling

52,"Eric's passion overcame him; he stamped furiously on the ground, and burst out, ""I _will_ speak, sir; you have been unjust to me for a long time, but I will _not_ be--""",passion overcame stamp ground burst speak sir unjust long time 
53,"Mr. Gordon's cane fell sharply across the boy's back; he stopped, glared for a moment; and then saying:",cane fall boy back stop glare moment say

56,"""Well, my boy,"" said the master, softening in a moment, and laying his hand gently on Russell's head, ""what have you to say? You cannot tell how I rejoice, amid the deep sorrow that this has caused me, to find that _you_ at least are uncontaminated. But I _knew_, Edwin, that I could trust you.""",boy say master soften moment lay hand head have say tell rejoice deep sorrow cause find least uncontaminated _knew trust 
57,"""O sir, I come to speak for Eric--for Williams."" Mr. Gordon's brow darkened again, and the storm gathered, as he interrupted vehemently, ""Not a word, Russell; not a word. This is the _second_ time that he has wilfully deceived me; and this time he has involved others too in his base deceit.""",come speak brow darken storm gather interrupt word word _second_ time deceive time involve other base deceit

66,"Eric took the advice, and, full of mortification, went home. He gave his father a true and manly account of the whole occurrence, and that afternoon Mr. Williams wrote a note of apology and explanation to Mr. Gordon. Next time the form went up, Mr. Gordon said, in his most freezing tones, ""Williams, at present I shall take no further notice of your offence beyond including you in the extra lesson every half-holiday.""",take advice full mortification go give father true manly account whole occurrence afternoon write note apology explanation next time form go say freeze tone present take further notice offence include extra lesson half holiday 
67,"From that day forward Eric felt that he was marked and suspected, and the feeling worked on him with the worst effects. He grew more careless in work, and more trifling and indifferent in manner. Several boys now beat him whom he had easily surpassed before, and his energies were for a time entirely directed to keeping that supremacy in the games which he had won by his activity and strength.",day feel mark suspect feeling work bad effect grow careless work trifling indifferent manner several boy beat surpass energy time direct keep supremacy game win activity strength 
68,"It was a Sunday afternoon, towards the end of the summer term, and the boys were sauntering about in the green playground, or lying on the banks reading and chatting. Eric was with a little knot of his chief friends, enjoying the sea breeze as they sat on the grass. At last the bell of the school chapel began to ring, and they went in to the afternoon service. Eric usually sat with Duncan and Llewellyn, immediately behind the benches allotted to chance visitors. The bench in front of them happened on this afternoon to be occupied by some rather odd people, viz., an old man with long white hair, and two ladies remarkably stout, who were dressed with much juvenility, although past middle age. Their appearance immediately attracted notice, and no sooner had they taken their seats than Duncan and Llewellyn began to titter. The ladies' bonnets, which were of white, trimmed with long green leaves and flowers, just peered over the top of the boys' pew, and excited much amusement. But Eric had not yet learnt to disregard the solemnity of the place, and the sacred act in which they were engaged. He tried to look away, and attend to the service, and for a time he partially succeeded, although, seated as he was between the two triflers, who were perpetually telegraphing to each other their jokes, he found it a difficult task, and secretly he began to be much tickled.",afternoon end summer term boy saunter green playground lie bank read chat little knot chief friend enjoy sea breeze sit grass last bell school chapel begin ring go afternoon service sit bench allot chance visitor bench front happen afternoon occupy odd person viz. old man long white hair lady stout dress much juvenility past middle age appearance attract notice take seat begin titter lady bonnet white trim long green leave flower peer top boy pew excite much amusement learn disregard solemnity place sacred act engage try look attend service time succeed seat trifler telegraph other joke find difficult task begin tickle 
69,"At last the sermon commenced, and Llewellyn, who had imprisoned a grasshopper in a paper cage, suddenly let it hop out. The first hop took it to the top of the pew; the second perched it on the shoulder of the stoutest lady. Duncan and Llewellyn tittered louder, and even Eric could not resist a smile. But when the lady, feeling some irritation on her shoulder, raised her hand, and the grasshopper took a frightened leap into the centre of the green foliage which enwreathed her bonnet, none of the three could stand it, and they burst into fits of laughter, which they tried in vain to conceal by bending down their heads and cramming their handkerchiefs into their mouths. Eric, having once given way, enjoyed the joke uncontrollably, and the lady made matters worse by her uneasy attempts to dislodge the unknown intruder, and discover the cause of the tittering, which she could not help hearing. At last all three began to laugh so violently that several heads were turned in their direction, and Dr. Rowlands' stern eye caught sight of their levity. He stopped short in his sermon, and for one instant transfixed them with his indignant glance. Quiet was instantly restored, and alarm reduced them to the most perfect order, although the grasshopper still sat imperturbable among the artificial flowers. Meanwhile the stout lady had discovered that for some unknown reason she had been causing considerable amusement, and, attributing it to intentional ridicule, looked round, justly hurt. Eric, with real shame, observed the deep vexation of her manner, and bitterly repented his share in the transaction.",last sermon commence imprison grasshopper paper cage let hop first hop take top pew second perch shoulder stoutest lady titter resist smile lady feel irritation shoulder raise hand grasshopper take frighten leap centre green foliage enwreath bonnet stand burst fit laughter try vain conceal bending head cramm handkerchief mouth give way enjoy joke lady make matter bad uneasy attempt dislodge unknown intruder discover cause tittering help hear last begin laugh several head turn direction stern eye catch sight levity stop short sermon instant transfixe indignant glance quiet restore alarm reduce perfect order grasshopper sit imperturbable artificial flower stout lady discover unknown reason cause considerable amusement attribute intentional ridicule look hurt real shame observe deep vexation manner repent share transaction 
70,"Next morning Dr. Rowlands, in full academicals, sailed into the fourth-form room. His entrance was the signal for every boy to rise, and after a word or two to Mr. Gordon, he motioned them to be seated. Eric's heart sank within him.",next morning full academical sail fourth form room entrance signal boy rise word motion seat heart sink 
71,"""Williams, Duncan, and Llewellyn, stand out!"" said the Doctor. The boys, with downcast eyes and burning cheeks, stood before him.",stand say boy downcast eye burn cheek stand 
72,"""I was sorry to notice,"" said he, ""your shameful conduct in chapel yesterday afternoon. As far as I could observe, you were making yourselves merry in that sacred place with the personal defects of others. The lessons you receive here must be futile indeed, if they do not teach you the duty of reverence to God, and courtesy to man. It gives me special pain, Williams, to have observed that you, too, a boy high in your remove, were guilty of this most culpable levity. You will all come to me at twelve o'clock in the library.""",sorry notice say shameful conduct chapel yesterday afternoon observe make merry sacred place personal defect other lesson receive futile teach duty reverence courtesy man give special pain observe boy high remove guilty culpable levity come o'clock library 
73,"At twelve o'clock they each received a flogging. The pain inflicted was not great, and Duncan and Llewellyn, who had got into similar trouble before, cared very little for it, and went out laughing to tell the number of swishes they had received, to a little crowd of boys who were lingering outside the library door. But not so Eric. It was his _first_ flogging, and he felt it deeply. To his proud spirit the disgrace was intolerable. At that moment he hated Dr. Rowlands, he hated Mr. Gordon, he hated his schoolfellows, he hated everybody. He had been flogged; the thought haunted him; he, Eric Williams, had been forced to receive this most degrading corporal punishment. He pushed fiercely through the knot of boys, and strode as quick as he could along the playground, angry and impenitent.",o'clock receive flog pain inflict great get similar trouble care little go laugh tell number swishe receive little crowd boy linger library door _first_ flog feel proud spirit disgrace intolerable moment hate hate hate schoolfellow hate flogge thought haunt force receive degrading corporal punishment push knot boy strode playground angry impenitent 
74,"At the gate Russell met him. Eric felt the meeting inopportune; he was ashamed to meet his friend, ashamed to speak to him, envious of him, and jealous of his better reputation. He wanted to pass him by without notice, but Russell would not suffer this. He came up to him and took his arm affectionately. The slightest allusion to his late disgrace would have made Eric flame out into passion; but Russell was too kind to allude to it then. He talked as if nothing had happened, and tried to turn his friend's thoughts to more pleasant subjects. Eric appreciated his kindness, but he was still sullen and fretful, and it was not until they parted that his better feelings won the day. But when Russell said to him ""Good bye, Eric,"" it was too much for him, and seizing Edwin's hand, he wrung it hard, and tears rushed to his eyes.",gate meet feel meeting inopportune ashamed meet friend ashamed speak envious jealous good reputation want pass notice suffer come take arm slight allusion late disgrace make flame passion kind allude talk happen try turn friend thought pleasant subject appreciate kindness sullen fretful part good feeling win day say good much seize hand wrung tear rush eye

76,"""Nay, Eric,"" said Russell, ""you may be far better than I. You have far batter gifts, if you will only do yourself justice.""",say good have batter gift do justice 
77,"They parted by Mr. Williams' door, and Russell walked home sad and thoughtful; but Eric, barely answering his brother's greeting, rushed up to his room, and, flinging himself on his bed, sobbed like a child at the remembrance of his disgrace. They were not refreshing tears; he felt something hard at his heart, and, as he prayed neither for help nor forgiveness, it was pride and rebellion, not penitence, that made him miserable.",part door walk sad thoughtful answer brother greeting rush room fling bed sobb child remembrance disgrace refresh tear feel hard heart pray help forgiveness pride rebellion penitence make miserable
