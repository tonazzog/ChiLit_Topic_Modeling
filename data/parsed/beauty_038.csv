2," Winter came in early, with a great deal of cold and wet. There was snow, or sleet, or rain almost every day for weeks, changing only for keen driving winds or sharp frosts. The horses all felt it very much. When it is a dry cold a couple of good thick rugs will keep the warmth in us; but when it is soaking rain they soon get wet through and are no good. Some of the drivers had a waterproof cover to throw over, which was a fine thing; but some of the men were so poor that they could not protect either themselves or their horses, and many of them suffered very much that winter. When we horses had worked half the day we went to our dry stables, and could rest, while they had to sit on their boxes, sometimes staying out as late as one or two o’clock in the morning if they had a party to wait for.",come great deal cold wet be snow sleet rain day week change keen driving wind sharp frost horse feel dry cold couple good thick rug keep warmth soak rain get wet good driver have waterproof cover throw fine thing man poor protect horse many suffer winter horse work day go dry stable rest have sit box stay o'clock morning have party wait 
3,"When the streets were slippery with frost or snow that was the worst of all for us horses. One mile of such traveling, with a weight to draw and no firm footing, would take more out of us than four on a good road; every nerve and muscle of our bodies is on the strain to keep our balance; and, added to this, the fear of falling is more exhausting than anything else. If the roads are very bad indeed our shoes are roughed, but that makes us feel nervous at first.",street slippery frost snow bad horse mile such traveling weight draw firm footing take more good road nerve muscle body strain keep balance add fear falling exhausting else road bad shoe rough make feel nervous first 
4,"When the weather was very bad many of the men would go and sit in the tavern close by, and get some one to watch for them; but they often lost a fare in that way, and could not, as Jerry said, be there without spending money. He never went to the Rising Sun; there was a coffee-shop near, where he now and then went, or he bought of an old man, who came to our rank with tins of hot coffee and pies. It was his opinion that spirits and beer made a man colder afterward, and that dry clothes, good food, cheerfulness, and a comfortable wife at home, were the best things to keep a cabman warm. Polly always supplied him with something to eat when he could not get home, and sometimes he would see little Dolly peeping from the corner of the street, to make sure if “father” was on the stand. If she saw him she would run off at full speed and soon come back with something in a tin or basket, some hot soup or pudding Polly had ready. It was wonderful how such a little thing could get safely across the street, often thronged with horses and carriages; but she was a brave little maid, and felt it quite an honor to bring “father’s first course”, as he used to call it. She was a general favorite on the stand, and there was not a man who would not have seen her safely across the street, if Jerry had not been able to do it.",weather bad many man go sit tavern get one watch lose fare way say spend money go be coffee shop go buy old man come rank tin hot coffee pie opinion spirit beer make man cold dry clothes good food cheerfulness comfortable wife home good thing keep cabman warm supply eat get see little peep corner street make sure father stand see run full speed come tin basket hot soup pudding have ready wonderful little thing get street throng horse carriage brave little maid feel honor bring father first course use call general favorite stand be man see street able do 
5,"One cold windy day Dolly had brought Jerry a basin of something hot, and was standing by him while he ate it. He had scarcely begun when a gentleman, walking toward us very fast, held up his umbrella. Jerry touched his hat in return, gave the basin to Dolly, and was taking off my cloth, when the gentleman, hastening up, cried out, “No, no, finish your soup, my friend; I have not much time to spare, but I can wait till you have done, and set your little girl safe on the pavement.” So saying, he seated himself in the cab. Jerry thanked him kindly, and came back to Dolly.",cold windy day bring basin hot stand eat begin gentleman walk hold umbrella touch hat return give basin take cloth gentleman hasten cry finish soup friend have much time spare wait do set little girl safe pavement say seat cab thank come 
6,"“There, Dolly, that’s a gentleman; that’s a real gentleman, Dolly; he has got time and thought for the comfort of a poor cabman and a little girl.”",gentleman real gentleman get time think comfort poor cabman little girl 
7,"Jerry finished his soup, set the child across, and then took his orders to drive to Clapham Rise. Several times after that the same gentleman took our cab. I think he was very fond of dogs and horses, for whenever we took him to his own door two or three dogs would come bounding out to meet him. Sometimes he came round and patted me, saying in his quiet, pleasant way, “This horse has got a good master, and he deserves it.”  It was a very rare thing for any one to notice the horse that had been working for him. I have known ladies to do it now and then, and this gentleman, and one or two others have given me a pat and a kind word; but ninety-nine persons out of a hundred would as soon think of patting the steam engine that drew the train.",finish soup set child take order drive several time same gentleman take cab think fond dog horse take own door dog come bound meet come patt say quiet pleasant way horse get good master deserve rare thing one notice horse work know lady do gentleman other give pat kind word person think pat steam engine draw train 
8,"The gentleman was not young, and there was a forward stoop in his shoulders as if he was always going at something. His lips were thin and close shut, though they had a very pleasant smile; his eye was keen, and there was something in his jaw and the motion of his head that made one think he was very determined in anything he set about. His voice was pleasant and kind; any horse would trust that voice, though it was just as decided as everything else about him.",gentleman young be forward stoop shoulder go lip thin close shut have pleasant smile eye keen be jaw motion head make think determined set voice pleasant kind horse trust voice decide else 
9,"One day he and another gentleman took our cab; they stopped at a shop in R---- Street, and while his friend went in he stood at the door. A little ahead of us on the other side of the street a cart with two very fine horses was standing before some wine vaults; the carter was not with them, and I cannot tell how long they had been standing, but they seemed to think they had waited long enough, and began to move off. Before they had gone many paces the carter came running out and caught them. He seemed furious at their having moved, and with whip and rein punished them brutally, even beating them about the head. Our gentleman saw it all, and stepping quickly across the street, said in a decided voice:",day gentleman take cab stop shop friend go stand door little other side street cart fine horse stand wine vault tell stand seem think wait begin move go many pace come run catch seem furious move whip rein punish beat head gentleman see step street say decide voice 
10,"“If you don’t stop that directly, I’ll have you arrested for leaving your horses, and for brutal conduct.”",stop arrest leave horse brutal conduct 
11,"The man, who had clearly been drinking, poured forth some abusive language, but he left off knocking the horses about, and taking the reins, got into his cart; meantime our friend had quietly taken a note-book from his pocket, and looking at the name and address painted on the cart, he wrote something down.",man drink pour abusive language leave knock horse take rein get cart friend take note book pocket look name address paint cart write 
12,"“What do you want with that?” growled the carter, as he cracked his whip and was moving on. A nod and a grim smile was the only answer he got.",want growl crack whip move nod grim smile only answer get 
13,"On returning to the cab our friend was joined by his companion, who said laughingly, “I should have thought, Wright, you had enough business of your own to look after, without troubling yourself about other people’s horses and servants.”",return cab friend join companion say think have enough business own look trouble other person horse servant 
14,"Our friend stood still for a moment, and throwing his head a little back, “Do you know why this world is as bad as it is?”",friend stand moment throw head little know world bad 
15,"“No,” said the other.",say other 
16,"“Then I’ll tell you. It is because people think only about their own business, and won’t trouble themselves to stand up for the oppressed, nor bring the wrongdoer to light. I never see a wicked thing like this without doing what I can, and many a master has thanked me for letting him know how his horses have been used.”",tell person think own business trouble stand oppress bring wrongdoer light see wicked thing do many master thank let know horse use 
17,"“I wish there were more gentlemen like you, sir,” said Jerry, “for they are wanted badly enough in this city.”",wish be more gentleman sir say want city 
18,"After this we continued our journey, and as they got out of the cab our friend was saying, “My doctrine is this, that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop, and do nothing, we make ourselves sharers in the guilt.”",continue journey get cab friend say doctrine see cruelty wrong have power stop do make sharer guilt
