You must go to Shiny Wall, and through the white gate that never was opened; and then you will come to Peacepool, and Mother Carey's Haven, where the good whales go when they die.

13,"And she shook hands with him, and bade him good-bye.  Tom longed very much again to kiss her; but he thought it would not be respectful, considering she was a lady born; so he promised not to forget her:  but his little whirl-about of a head was so full of the notion of going out to see the world, that it forgot her in five minutes:  however, though his head forgot her, I am glad to say his heart did not.",shake hand bid good bye long kiss think respectful consider lady bear promise forget little whirl head full notion go see world forget minute head forget glad say heart

15,"Then he met a ship, far larger than he had ever seen--a gallant ocean-steamer, with a long cloud of smoke trailing behind; and he wondered how she went on without sails, and swam up to her to see. A school of dolphins were running races round and round her, going three feet for her one, and Tom asked them the way to Shiny Wall: but they did not know.  Then he tried to find out how she moved, and at last he saw her screw, and was so delighted with it that he played under her quarter all day, till he nearly had his nose knocked off by the fans, and thought it time to move.  Then he watched the sailors upon deck, and the ladies, with their bonnets and parasols:  but none of them could see him, because their eyes were not opened,--as, indeed, most people's eyes are not.",meet ship large see gallant ocean steamer long cloud smoke trail wonder go sail swim see school dolphin run race go foot ask way shiny know try find move last see screw delighted play quarter day have nose knock fan think time move watch sailor deck lady bonnet parasol see eye open most person eye

21," Her voice was so soft and low, and the music of the air so sweet, that Tom could have listened to it all day.  But as she held the baby over the gallery rail, to show it the dolphins leaping and the water gurgling in the ship's wake, lo! and behold, the baby saw Tom.",voice soft low music air sweet listen day hold baby gallery rail show dolphin leap water gurgle ship wake baby see

24,"She gave a little shriek and start; and then she said, quite quietly, ""Babies in the sea?

25,"And at that an old nurse, all in black, came out and talked to her, and drew her in.  And Tom turned away northward, sad and wondering; and watched the great steamer slide away into the dusk, and the lights on board peep out one by one, and die out again, and the long bar of smoke fade away into the evening mist, till all was out of sight.",old nurse black come talk draw turn sad wonder watch great steamer slide dusk light board peep die long bar smoke fade evening mist sight 
26,"And he swam northward again, day after day, till at last he met the King of the Herrings, with a curry-comb growing out of his nose, and a sprat in his mouth for a cigar, and asked him the way to Shiny Wall; so he bolted his sprat head foremost, and said:",swim day day last meet curry comb grow nose sprat mouth cigar ask way shiny bolt sprat head say

32,"And away Tom went for seven days and seven nights due north-west, till he came to a great codbank, the like of which he never saw before.  The great cod lay below in tens of thousands, and gobbled shell-fish all day long; and the blue sharks roved above in hundreds, and gobbled them when they came up.  So they ate, and ate, and ate each other, as they had done since the making of the world; for no man had come here yet to catch them, and find out how rich old Mother Carey is.",go day night due come great codbank like see great cod lay ten thousand gobble shell fish day blue shark rove hundred gobble come eat eat eat other do making world man come catch find rich old 
33,"And there he saw the last of the Gairfowl, standing up on the Allalonestones all alone.  And a very grand old lady she was, full three feet high, and bolt upright, like some old Highland chieftainess.  She had on a black velvet gown, and a white pinner and apron, and a very high bridge to her nose (which is a sure mark of high breeding), and a large pair of white spectacles on it, which made her look rather odd:  but it was the ancient fashion of her house.",see last stand grand old lady full foot high bolt old chieftainess have black velvet gown white pinner apron high bridge nose sure mark high breeding large pair white spectacle make look odd ancient fashion house

41,"""Then I shall have great pleasure in talking to you, my dear.  It is quite refreshing nowadays to see anything without wings.  They must all have wings, forsooth, now, every new upstart sort of bird, and fly.  What can they want with flying, and raising themselves above their proper station in life?  In the days of my ancestors no birds ever thought of having wings, and did very well without; and now they all laugh at me because I keep to the good old fashion. Why, the very marrocks and dovekies have got wings, the vulgar creatures, and poor little ones enough they are; and my own cousins too, the razor-bills, who are gentlefolk born, and ought to know better than to ape their inferiors.""",have great pleasure talk dear refresh see wing have wing forsooth new upstart sort bird fly want fly raise proper station life day ancestor bird think have wing do laugh keep good old fashion very marrock doveky get wing vulgar creature poor little one own cousin razor bill gentlefolk bear know good ape inferior

43,"""Shiny Wall?  Who should know better than I?  We all came from Shiny Wall, thousands of years ago, when it was decently cold, and the climate was fit for gentlefolk; but now, what with the heat, and what with these vulgar-winged things who fly up and down and eat everything, so that gentlepeople's hunting is all spoilt, and one really cannot get one's living, or hardly venture off the rock for fear of being flown against by some creature that would not have dared to come within a mile of one a thousand years ago--what was I saying?  Why, we have quite gone down in the world, my dear, and have nothing left but our honour.  And I am the last of my family.  A friend of mine and I came and settled on this rock when we were young, to be out of the way of low people.  Once we were a great nation, and spread over all the Northern Isles.  But men shot us so, and knocked us on the head, and took our eggs--why, if you will believe it, they say that on the coast of Labrador the sailors used to lay a plank from the rock on board the thing called their ship, and drive us along the plank by hundreds, till we tumbled down into the ship's waist in heaps; and then, I suppose, they ate us, the nasty fellows!  Well--but--what was I saying?  At last, there were none of us left, except on the old Gairfowlskerry, just off the Iceland coast, up which no man could climb.  Even there we had no peace; for one day, when I was quite a young girl, the land rocked, and the sea boiled, and the sky grew dark, and all the air was filled with smoke and dust, and down tumbled the old Gairfowlskerry into the sea.  The dovekies and marrocks, of course, all flew away; but we were too proud to do that.  Some of us were dashed to pieces, and some drowned; and those who were left got away to Eldey, and the dovekies tell me they are all dead now, and that another Gairfowlskerry has risen out of the sea close to the old one, but that it is such a poor flat place that it is not safe to live on:  and so here I am left alone.""",shiny wall know good come shiny thousand year cold climate fit gentlefolk heat vulgar winged thing fly eat gentlepeople hunting spoil get living venture rock fear fly creature dare come mile year say go world dear have leave honour last family friend come settle rock young way low person great nation spread northern man shoot knock head take egg believe say coast sailor use lay plank rock board thing call ship drive plank hundred tumble ship waist heap suppose eat nasty fellow say last be leave old coast man climb have peace day young girl land rock sea boil sky grow dark air fill smoke dust tumble old sea doveky marrock course fly proud do dash piece drown leave get doveky tell dead rise sea old one poor flat place safe live leave alone

56,"But by there came a flock of petrels, who are Mother Carey's own chickens; and Tom thought them much prettier than Lady Gairfowl, and so perhaps they were; for Mother Carey had had a great deal of fresh experience between the time that she invented the Gairfowl and the time that she invented them.  They flitted along like a flock of black swallows, and hopped and skipped from wave to wave, lifting up their little feet behind them so daintily, and whistling to each other so tenderly, that Tom fell in love with them at once, and called them to know the way to Shiny Wall.",come flock petrel own chicken think pretty have great deal fresh experience time invent time invent flite flock black swallow hopp skip wave wave lift little foot whistle other fall love call know way shiny

61,"The old Gairfowl is gone already:  but there are better things come in her place; and when Tom comes he will see the fishing-smacks anchored there in hundreds, from Scotland, and from Ireland, and from the Orkneys, and the Shetlands, and from all the Northern ports, full of the children of the old Norse Vikings, the masters of the sea.  And the men will be hauling in the great cod by thousands, till their hands are sore from the lines; and they will be making cod-liver oil and guano, and salting down the fish; and there will be a man-of-war steamer there to protect them, and a lighthouse to show them the way; and you and I, perhaps, shall go some day to the Allalonestone to the great summer sea-fair, and dredge strange creatures such as man never saw before; and we shall hear the sailors boast that it is not the worst jewel in Queen Victoria's crown, for there are eighty miles of codbank, and food for all the poor folk in the land.  That is what Tom will see, and perhaps you and I shall see it too.  And then we shall not be sorry because we cannot get a Gairfowl to stuff, much less find gairfowl enough to drive them into stone pens and slaughter them, as the old Norsemen did, or drive them on board along a plank till the ship was victualled with them, as the old English and French rovers used to do, of whom dear old Hakluyt tells:  but we shall remember what Mr. Tennyson says:  how",old gone be good thing come place come see fishing smack anchore hundred northern port full child old master sea man haul great cod thousand hand sore line make cod-liver oil guano salt fish be man war steamer protect lighthouse show way go day great summer sea fair dredge strange creature such man see hear sailor boast bad jewel crown be mile codbank food poor folk land see see sorry get stuff find gairfowl drive stone pen slaughter old drive board plank ship victuall old english french rover use do dear old tell remember say

They must go first to Allfowlsness, and wait there for the great gathering of all the sea-birds, before they start for their summer breeding-places far away in the Northern Isles; and there they would be sure to find some birds which were going to Shiny Wall:  but where Allfowlsness was, he must promise never to tell, lest men should go there and shoot the birds, and stuff them, and put them into stupid museums, instead of leaving them to play and breed and work in Mother Carey's water-garden, where they ought to be.",agog start shiny petrel say go wait great gathering sea bird start summer breeding place northern sure find bird go shiny promise tell man go shoot bird stuff put stupid museum leave play breed work water garden 
64,"So where Allfowlsness is nobody must know; and all that is to be said about it is, that Tom waited there many days; and as he waited, he saw a very curious sight.  On the rabbit burrows on the shore there gathered hundreds and hundreds of hoodie-crows, such as you see in Cambridgeshire.

66,"And they cawed and cawed, and boasted of all the clever things they had done; how many lambs' eyes they had picked out, and how many dead bullocks they had eaten, and how many young grouse they had swallowed whole, and how many grouse-eggs they had flown away with, stuck on the point of their bills, which is the hoodie-crow's particularly clever feat, of which he is as proud as a gipsy is of doing the hokany-baro; and what that is, I won't tell you.",caw caw boast clever thing do many lamb eye pick many dead bullock eat many young grouse swallow whole many grouse egg fly stuck point bill hoodie crow clever feat proud gipsy do hokany baro tell

So she was to be tried publicly by their laws (for the hoodies always try some offenders in their great yearly parliament).  And there she stood in the middle, in her black gown and gray hood, looking as meek and as neat as a Quakeress, and they all bawled at her at once -",last bring prettiest neatest young lady crow see set middle begin abuse vilify rating bullyragg steal grouse egg dare say steal try law hoody try offender great yearly parliament stand middle black gown gray hood look meek neat bawl

But the moment afterwards, they all threw up their bills into the air, and gave one screech; and then turned head over heels backward, and fell down dead, one hundred and twenty-three of them at once.

But he never minded the birds nor hurt them, because they were not in season; indeed, he minded but two things in the whole world, and those were, his Bible and his grouse; for he was as good an old Scotchman as ever knit stockings on a winter's night:  only, when all the birds were going, he toddled out, and took off his cap to them, and wished them a merry journey and a safe return; and then gathered up all the feathers which they had left, and cleaned them to sell down south, and make feather- beds for stuffy people to lie on.",while bird begin gather thousand ten thousand blacken air swan brant geese harlequin eider harold garganey smew goosander diver loon grebe doveky auk razor bill gannet petrel skua tern gull naming numbering paddle wash splash comb brush sand shore white feather quack cluck gabble chatter scream whoop talk matter friend settle go breed summer hear mile lucky be hear old keeper live turf hut thatch heather fring great stone sling roof bend rope winter gale blow hut minded bird hurt season minded thing whole world grouse good old scotchman knit stocking winter night bird go toddle take cap wish merry journey safe return gather feather leave clean sell make feather bed stuffy person lie

77,"And then all the birds rose up, and streamed away in long black lines, north, and north-east, and north-west, across the bright blue summer sky; and their cry was like ten thousand packs of hounds, and ten thousand peals of bells.  Only the puffins stayed behind, and killed the young rabbits, and laid their eggs in the rabbit-burrows; which was rough practice, certainly; but a man must see to his own family.",bird rise stream long black line north north east north bright blue summer sky cry pack hound peal bell puffin stay kill young rabbit lay egg rabbit burrow rough practice man see own family

But Tom and the petrels never cared, for the gale was right abaft, and away they went over the crests of the billows, as merry as so many flying-fish.",petrel go begin blow old gentleman gray great coat look big copper boiler gulf get behindhand work send electric message more steam steam come much hour ought come week puffing roar swish swirl see sky end sea begin petrel care gale abaft go crest billow merry many fly fish

And for every wing above it had a leg below, with a claw like a comb at the tip, and a nostril at the root; and in the middle it had no stomach and one eye; and as for its mouth, that was all on one side, as the madreporiform tubercle in a star- fish is.

For, as the vapours came up out of the hole, the bogy smelt them with his nostrils, and combed them and sorted them with his combs; and then, when they steamed up through them against his wings, they were changed into showers and streams of metal.  From one wing fell gold-dust, and from another silver, and from another copper, and from another tin, and from another lead, and so on, and sank into the soft mud, into veins and cracks, and hardened there.

But the fairies hide them out of the way in that country as fast as they can, and very hard work they have, and of very little use it is.  For as fast as they hide away the old trash, foolish and wicked people make fresh trash full of lime and poisonous paints, and actually go and steal receipts out of old Madame Science's big book to invent poisons for little children, and sell them at wakes and fairs and tuck-shops.  Very well.  Let them go on.  Dr. Letheby and Dr. Hassall cannot catch them, though they are setting traps for them all day long.

And, all the rest of the little people in the world read the books, and thought themselves each as good as the President; and perhaps they were right, for every one knows his own business best.

Tom couldn't help saying that though they did fancy they had carried all the wit away with them out of Lincolnshire two hundred years ago, yet if they had had one such Lincolnshire nobleman among them as good old Lord Yarborough, he would have called for the fire-engines before he hanged other people's dogs. But it was of no use, and the dog was hanged:  and Tom couldn't even have his carcase; for they had abolished the have-his-carcase act in that country, for fear lest when rogues fell out, honest men should come by their own.  And so they would have succeeded perfectly, as they always do, only that (as they also always do) they failed in one little particular, viz. that the dog would not die, being a water-dog, but bit their fingers so abominably that they were forced to let him go, and Tom likewise, as British subjects.
