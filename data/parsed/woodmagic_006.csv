1,CHAPTER VI. THE SQUIRREL.,squirrel 
2," All this talking had passed away the morning, but in the afternoon, when the sun got a little lower, and the heat was not quite so great, Bevis, who had not been allowed to go out at noon, came forth again, and at once started up the Home Field. He easily reached the great oak-tree, and from there he knew his way to the corner of the wheat-field, where he stopped and looked for the hare, but she was not there, nor did she answer when he called to her. At the sound of his voice a number of sparrows rose from the wheat, which was now ripening, and flew up to the hedge, where they began to chatter about Kapchack's love affair.",talking pass morning afternoon sun get little low heat great allow go noon come start reach great oak tree know way corner wheat field stop look hare answer call sound voice number sparrow rise wheat ripen fly hedge begin chatter love affair 
3,"Bevis walked on across the field, and presently found a footpath; he followed this, as the toad had instructed him, and after getting over two stiles there was the copse on the right, though he had to climb over a high gate to get into the meadow next to it. There was nothing in the meadow except a rabbit, who turned up his white tail and went into his hole, for having seen Bevis with the hare, whom he did not like, the rabbit did not care to speak to Bevis. When Bevis had crossed the meadow he found, just as the toad had said, that there was a very deep ditch round the copse, but scarcely any water in it, and that was almost hidden with weeds.",walk field find footpath follow toad instruct get stile copse right have climb high gate get meadow be meadow rabbit turn white tail go hole see hare like rabbit care speak cross meadow find toad say be deep ditch copse water hide weed 
4,"After walking a little way along the ditch he saw the tree which had been cut down and thrown across for a bridge. It was covered with moss, and in the shadow underneath it the hart's-tongue fern was growing. Remembering what the toad had told him, Bevis put his hand on the rail--it was a willow pole--but found that it was not very safe, for at the end the wasps (a long time ago) had eaten it hollow, carrying away the wood for their nests, and what they had left had become rotten. Still it was enough to steady his footsteps, and taking care that he did not put his foot on a knot, Bevis got across safely. There was a rail to climb over on the other side, and then he was in the copse, and began to walk down a broad green path, a road which wound in among the ash-wood.",walk little way ditch see tree cut throw bridge cover moss shadow hart tongue fern grow remember toad tell put hand rail willow pole find safe end wasp long time eat hollow carry wood nest leave become rotten enough steady footstep take care put foot knot get be rail climb other side copse begin walk broad green path road wind ash wood 
5,"Nobody said anything to him, it was quite silent, so silent, that he could hear the snap of the dragon-fly's wing as he stopped in his swift flight and returned again. Bevis pulled a handful of long green rushes, and then he picked some of the burrs from the tall burdocks; they stuck to his fingers when he tried to fling them away, and would not go. The great thistles were ever so far above his head, and the humble-bees on them glanced down at him as he passed. Bevis very carefully looked at the bramble-bushes to see how the blackberries were coming on; but the berries were red and green, and the flowers had not yet all gone. There was such a beautiful piece of woodbine hanging from one of the ash-poles that he was not satisfied till he had gathered some of it; the long brome-grass tickled his face while he was pulling at the honeysuckle.",say silent silent hear snap dragon fly wing stop swift flight return pull handful long green rushe pick burr tall burdock stick finger try fling go great thistle head humble bee glance pass look bramble bush see blackberry come berries red green flower go be beautiful piece hang ash pole satisfy gather long brome grass tickle face pull honeysuckle 
6,"He clapped his hands when he found some young nuts; he knew they were not ripe, but he picked one and bit it with his teeth, just to feel how soft it was. There were several very nice sticks, some of which he had half a mind to stay and cut, and put his hand in his pocket for his knife, but there were so many things to look at, he thought he would go on a little farther, and come back and cut them presently. The ferns were so tall and thick in many places that he could not see in among the trees. When he looked back he had left the place where he came in so far behind that he could not see it, nor when he looked round could he see any daylight through the wood; there was only the sky overhead and the trees and ash-stoles, and bushes, and thistles, and long grass, and fern all about him.",clapp hand find young nut know ripe pick bite tooth feel soft be several nice stick have mind stay cut put hand pocket knife be many thing look think go little far come cut fern tall thick many place see tree look leave place come see look see daylight wood be sky overhead tree ash stole bush thistle long grass fern 
7,"Bevis liked it very much, and he ran on and kicked over a bunch of tawny fungus as he went, till by-and-by he came to a piece of timber lying on the ground, and sat down upon it. Some finches went over just then; they were talking about Kapchack as they flew; they went so fast he could not hear much. But the squirrel was nowhere about; he called to him, but no one answered, and he began to think he should never find him, when presently, while he sat on the timber whistling very happily, something came round the corner, and Bevis saw it was the hare.",like run kick bunch tawny fungus go come piece timber lie ground sit finch go talk fly go hear much squirrel call answer begin think find sit timber whistling come corner see hare

11,"""I cannot tell you exactly where he lives,"" said the hare, ""but it is somewhere in the copse. It is of no use your looking about; it is in some hole or other, quite hidden, and you would never find it. I am afraid to come into the copse while he is here; but this afternoon the dragon-fly brought me word that the weasel had gone out. So I made haste to come while he was away, as I had not seen my old friend the squirrel for ever so long, and I wanted to know if the news was true.""",tell live say hare copse use look hole other hidden find afraid come copse afternoon dragon fly bring word weasel go make haste come see old friend squirrel want know news true

13,"""Yes, I mean about Kapchack,"" said the hare. ""Is it not silly of him to fall in love at his age? Why, he must be ten times as old as me! Really, I some times think that the older people get the sillier they are. But it is not much use your looking for the squirrel, dear. He may be up in the fir-tree, or he may be in the beech, or he may have gone along the hedge. If you were by yourself, the best thing you could do would be to sit still where you are, and he would be nearly sure to come by, sooner or later. He is so restless, he goes all over the copse, and is never very long in one place. Since, however, you and I have met, I will find him for you, and send him to you.""",mean say hare silly fall love age time old time think old person get silly much use look squirrel dear fir tree beech go hedge good thing do sit sure come restless go copse long place meet find send

16,"The hare leapt into the fern, and Bevis went after her. She led him in and out, and round the ash-stoles and bushes, till he had not the least idea which way he was going. After a time, they came to an immense thicket of bramble and thorn, and fern growing up in it, and honeysuckle climbing over it.",hare leapt fern go lead ash stole bush have least idea way go time come immense thicket bramble thorn fern grow honeysuckle climb 
17,"""It is inside this thicket,"" said the hare. ""Let us go all round, and see if we can find a way in.""",thicket say hare let go see find way 
18,"There was a place under an ash-stole, where Bevis could just creep beneath the boughs (the boughs held up the brambles), and after going on his hands and knees after the hare a good way, he found himself inside the thicket, where there was an open space grown over with raspberry canes. Bevis shouted with delight as he saw the raspberries were ripe, and began to eat them at once.",be place ash steal creep bough bough hold bramble go hand knee hare good way find thicket be open space grow raspberry cane shout delight see raspberry ripe begin eat 
19,"""How ever did they get here?"" he asked.",get ask 
20,"""I think it was the thrush,"" said the hare. ""It was one of the birds, no doubt. They take the fruit out of the orchards and gardens, and that was how it came here, I daresay. Now, don't you go outside the thicket till the squirrel comes. And when you have quite done talking to the squirrel, ask him to show you the way back to the timber, and there I will meet you, and lead you to the wheat-field, where you can see the oak-tree, and know your way home.

21,"Off went the hare to find the squirrel, and Bevis set to work to eat as many of the raspberries as he could.",go hare find squirrel set work eat many raspberry 
22,"Among the raspberry canes he found three or four rabbit-holes, and hearing the rabbits talking to each other, he stooped down to listen. They were talking scandal about the hare, and saying that she was very naughty, and rambled about too much. At this Bevis was very angry, and stamped his foot above the hole, and told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves for saying such things. The rabbits, very much frightened, went down farther into their holes. After which Bevis ate a great many more raspberries, and presently, feeling very lazy, he lay down on some moss at the foot of an oak-tree, and kicked his heels on the ground, and looked up at the blue sky, as he always did when he wanted some one to speak to. He did not know how long he had been gazing at the sky, when he heard some one say: ""Bevis dear!"" and turning that way he saw the squirrel, who had come up very quietly, and was sitting on one of the lower branches of the oak close to him.",raspberry cane find rabbit hole hear rabbit talk other stoop listen talk scandal hare say naughty ramble much angry stamp foot hole tell ashamed say such thing rabbit frighten go hole eat great many more raspberry feel lazy lay moss foot oak tree kick heel ground look blue sky do want one speak know gaze sky hear one say dear turn way see squirrel come sit low branch oak close 
23,"""Well, squirrel,"" said Bevis, sitting up; ""the toad said I was to remember him to you. And now be very quick, and tell me all you know about Kapchack, and who it is he is in love with, and all about the rebel, Choo Hoo, and everything else, in a minute.""",squirrel say sit toad say remember quick tell know love rebel else minute

25,"""First,"" said Bevis, interrupting, ""why did the starling say it was a great secret, when everybody knew it?""",say interrupt starling say great secret know 
26,"""It was a great secret,"" said the squirrel, ""till Prince Tchack-tchack came down here (he is the heir, you know) in a dreadful fit of temper, and told the tomtit whom he met in the fir-tree, and the tomtit told the woodpecker, and the woodpecker told the starling, who told his lady-love on the chimney, and the fly heard him, and when you opened the window the fly went out and buzzed it to everybody while you were at breakfast. By this time it is all over the world; and I daresay even the sea-gulls, though they live such a long way off, have heard it. Kapchack is beside himself with rage that it should be known, and Tchack-tchack is afraid to go near him. He made a great peck at Tchack-tchack just now.""",great secret say squirrel come heir know dreadful fit temper tell tomtit meet fir tree tomtit tell woodpecker woodpecker tell starling tell lady love chimney fly hear open window fly go buzz breakfast time world sea gull live long way hear rage know afraid go make great peck 
27,"""But why should there be so much trouble about it?"" said Bevis.",be much trouble say 
28,"""Oh,"" said the squirrel, ""it is a very serious business, let me tell you. It is not an ordinary falling in love, it is nothing less than a complete revolution of everything, and it will upset all the rules and laws that have been handed down ever since the world began.""",say squirrel serious business let tell ordinary falling love less complete revolution upset rule law hand world begin 
29,"""Dear me!"" said Bevis. ""And who is it Kapchack is in love with? I have asked twenty people, but no one will tell me.""",say love ask person tell 
30,"""Why, I am telling you,"" said the squirrel. ""Don't you see, if it had been an ordinary affair--only a young magpie--it would not have mattered much, though I daresay the queen would have been jealous, but this----""",tell say squirrel see ordinary affair young magpie matter much queen jealous 
31,"""Who is it?"" said Bevis, in a rage. ""Why don't you tell me who it is?""",say rage tell

35,"Up jumped Bevis. ""You're a stupid donkey,"" he shouted, and ran across to the other side, and threw a piece of stick up into an elm-tree after the squirrel. But the squirrel was so quick he could not see which way he had gone, and in half-a-minute he heard the squirrel say very softly: ""Bevis dear,"" behind him, and looked back, and there he was sitting on the oak bough again.",jump stupid donkey shout run other side throw piece stick elm tree squirrel squirrel quick see way go half minute hear squirrel say dear look sit oak bough 
36,"The squirrel, as the toad had said, was really a very good fellow; he was very quick to take offence, but his temper only lasted a minute. ""Bevis dear,"" he said, ""come back and sit down again on the moss, and I will tell you.""",squirrel toad say good fellow quick take offence temper last minute dear say come sit moss tell 
37,"""I sha'n't come back,"" said Bevis, rather sulkily. ""I shall sit here.""",come say sit 
38,"""No, no; don't stop there,"" said the squirrel, very anxiously. ""Don't stop there, dear; can't you see that great bough above you; that elm-tree is very wicked, and full of malice, do not stop there, he may hurt you.""",stop say squirrel stop dear see great bough elm tree wicked full malice stop hurt 
39,"""Pooh! what rubbish!"" said Bevis; ""I don't believe you. It is a very nice elm, I am sure. Besides, how can he hurt me? He has got no legs and he can't run after me, and he has no hands and he can't catch me. I'm not a bit afraid of him;"" and he kicked the elm with all his might. Without waiting a second, the squirrel jumped down out of the oak and ran across and caught hold of Bevis by his stocking--he could not catch hold of his jacket--and tried to drag him away. Seeing the squirrel in such an excited state, Bevis went with him to please him, and sat down on the moss under the oak. The squirrel went up on the bough, and Bevis laughed at him for being so silly.",rubbish say believe nice elm sure hurt get leg run have hand catch bit afraid kick elm wait second squirrel jump oak run catch hold stock catch hold jacket try drag see squirrel excited state go please sit moss oak squirrel go bough laugh silly 
40,"""Ah, but my dear Sir Bevis,"" said the squirrel, ""you do not know all, or you would not say what you did. You think because the elm has no legs and cannot run after you, and because he has no hands and cannot catch you, that therefore he cannot do you any harm. You are very much mistaken; that is a very malicious elm, and of a very wicked disposition. Elms, indeed, are very treacherous, and I recommend you to have nothing to do with them, dear.""",dear say squirrel know say do think elm have leg run have hand catch do harm mistaken malicious elm wicked disposition treacherous recommend have do dear 
41,"""But how could he hurt me?"" said Bevis.",hurt say 
42,"""He can wait till you go under him,"" said the squirrel, ""and then drop that big bough on you. He has had that bough waiting to drop on somebody for quite ten years. Just look up and see how thick it is, and heavy; why, it would smash a man out flat. Now, the reason the elms are so dangerous is because they will wait so long till somebody passes. Trees can do a great deal, I can tell you; why, I have known a tree, when it could not drop a bough, fall down altogether when there was not a breath of wind, nor any lightning, just to kill a cow or a sheep, out of sheer bad temper.""",wait go say squirrel drop big bough have bough wait drop year look see thick heavy smash man flat reason elm dangerous wait pass tree do great deal tell know tree drop bough fall be breath wind lightning kill cow sheep sheer bad temper

44,"""Oh, no,"" said the squirrel; ""the oak is a very good tree, and so is the beech and the ash, and many more (though I am not quite certain of the horse-chestnut, I have heard of his playing tricks), but the elm is not; if he can he will do something spiteful. I never go up an elm if I can help it, not unless I am frightened by a dog or somebody coming along. The only fall I ever had was out of an elm.",say squirrel oak good tree beech ash many more certain horse chestnut hear playing trick elm do spiteful go elm help frighten dog come only fall have elm

47,"""And elms are so patient, they will wait sixty or seventy years to do somebody an injury; if they cannot get a branch ready to fall they will let the rain in at a knot-hole, and so make it rotten inside, though it looks green without, or ask some fungus to come up and grow there, and so get the bough ready for them. That elm across there is quite rotten inside--there is a hole inside so big you could stand up, and yet if anybody went by they would say what a splendid tree.",elm patient wait year do injury get branch ready fall let rain knot hole make rotten look green ask fungus come grow get bough ready elm rotten be hole big stand go say splendid tree 
48,"""But if you asked Kauhaha, the rook, he would shake his head, and decline to have anything to do with that tree. So, my dear Sir Bevis, do not you think any more that because a thing has no legs, nor arms, nor eyes, nor ears, that therefore it cannot hurt you. There is the earth, for instance; you may stamp on the earth with your feet and she will not say anything, she will put up with anything, but she is always lying in wait all the same, and if you could only find all the money she has buried you would be the richest man in the world; I could tell you something about that.

50,"""But I assure you they can,"" said the squirrel. ""I will tell you a story about a flint that happened only a short time since, and then you will believe. Once upon a time a waggon was sent up on the hills to fetch a load of flints; it was a very old waggon, and it wanted mending, for it belonged to a man who never would mend anything.""",assure say squirrel tell story flint happen short time believe time waggon send hill fetch load flint old waggon want mending belong man mend

52,"""It was the same old gentleman (he is a farmer, only he is like your papa, Sir Bevis, and his land is his own), the same old gentleman who is so fond of Kapchack, whose palace is in his orchard. Well, the waggon went up on the hills, where the men had dug up some flints which had been lying quite motionless in the ground for so many thousand years that nobody could count them. There were at least five thousand flints, and the waggon went jolting down the hill and on to the road, and as it went the flints tried to get out, but they could not manage it, none but one flint, which was smaller than the rest.",same old gentleman farmer papa land own same old gentleman fond palace orchard waggon go hill man dig flint lie motionless ground many year count be least flint waggon go jolt hill road go flint try get manage flint small rest 
53,"""This one flint, of all the five thousand, squeezed out of a hole in the bottom of the waggon, and fell on the dust in the road, and was left there. There was not much traffic on the road (it is the same, dear, that goes to Southampton, where the ships are), so that it remained where it fell. Only one waggon came by with a load of hay, and had the wheel gone over the flint of course it would have been crushed to pieces. But the waggoner, instead of walking by his horses, was on the grass at the side of the road talking to a labourer in the field, and his team did not pass on their right side of the road, but more in the middle, and so the flint was not crushed.",flint squeeze hole bottom waggon fall dust road leave be much traffic road same dear go ship remain fall waggon come load hay have wheel go flint course crush piece waggoner walk horse grass side road talk labourer field team pass right side road more middle flint crush 
54,"""In the evening, when it was dark, a very old and very wealthy gentleman came along in his dog-cart, and his horse, which was a valuable one, chanced to slip on the flint, which, being sharp and jagged, hurt its hoof, and down the horse fell. The elderly gentleman and his groom, who was driving, were thrown out; the groom was not hurt, but his master broke his arm, and the horse broke his knees. The gentleman was so angry that no sooner did he get home than he dismissed the groom, though it was no fault of his, for how could he see the flint in the night? Nor would he give the man a character, and the consequence was he could not find another place. He soon began to starve, and then he was obliged to steal, and after a while he became a burglar.",evening dark old wealthy gentleman come dog cart horse valuable one chance slip flint sharp jagged hurt hoof horse fall elderly gentleman groom drive throw groom hurt master break arm horse break knee gentleman angry get dismiss groom fault see flint night give man character consequence find place begin starve oblige steal while become burglar 
55,"""One night he entered a house in London, and was getting on well, and stealing gold watches and such things, when somebody opened the door and tried to seize him. Pulling out his pistol, he shot his assailant dead on the spot, and at once escaped, and has not since been heard of, though you may be sure if he is caught he will be hung, and they are looking very sharp after him, because he stole a box with some papers in it which are said to be of great value. And the person he shot was the same gentleman who had discharged him because the horse fell down. Now all this happened through the flint, and as I told you, Bevis dear, about the elm, the danger with such things is that they will wait so long to do mischief.",night enter house get steal gold watch such thing open door try seize pull pistol shoot assailant dead spot escape hear sure catch hang look sharp steal box paper say great value person shoot same gentleman discharge horse fall happen flint tell dear elm danger such thing wait do mischief 
56,"""This flint, you see, waited so many years that nobody could count them, till the waggon came to fetch it. They are never tired of waiting. Be very careful, Bevis dear, how you climb up a tree, or how you put your head out of window, for there is a thing that is always lying in wait, and will pull you down in a minute, if you do not take care. It has been waiting there to make something fall ever since the beginning of the world, long before your house was built, dear, or before any of the trees grew. You cannot see it, but it is there, as you may prove by putting your cap out of window, which in a second will begin to fall down, as you would if you were tilted out.",flint see wait many year count waggon come fetch tired wait careful dear climb tree put head window be thing lie wait pull minute take care wait make fall beginning world house build dear tree grow see prove put cap window second begin fall tilt

58,"""Also, it is the same with your candle, Bevis dear, and this the bat told me, for he once saw it happen, looking in at a window as he flew by, and he shrieked as loud as he could, but his voice is so very shrill that it is not everybody can hear him, and all his efforts were in vain. For a lady had gone to sleep in bed and left her candle burning on the dressing-table, just where she had left it fifty times before, and found it burnt down to the socket in the morning, and no harm done. But that night she had had a new pair of gloves, which were wrapped up in a piece of paper, and she undid these gloves and left the piece of paper underneath the candlestick, and yet it would not have hurt had the candle been put up properly, but instead of that a match had been stuck in at the side, like a wedge, to keep it up. When the flame came down to the match the match caught fire, and when it had burnt a little way down, that piece fell off, and dropped on the paper in which the gloves had been wrapped. The paper being very thin was alight in an instant, and from the paper the flame travelled to some gauze things hung on the looking-glass, and from that to the window curtains, and from the window curtains to the bed curtains, till the room was in a blaze, and though the bat shrieked his loudest the lady did not wake till she was very much burnt.",same candle dear bat tell see happen look window fly shriek voice shrill hear effort vain lady go sleep bed leave candle burn dress table leave time find burn socket morning harm do night have new pair glove wrap piece paper undid glove leave piece paper candlestick hurt candle put match stick side wedge keep flame come match match catch fire burn little way piece fall drop paper glove wrap paper thin alight instant paper flame travel gauze thing hang look glass window curtain window curtain bed curtain room blaze bat shriek loudest lady wake burn 
59,"""Also with the sea; for the cod-fish told the seagull, who told the heron, who related the fact to the kingfisher, who informed me. The cod-fish was swimming about in the sea and saw a ship at anchor, and coming by the chain-cable the fish saw that one of the links of the chain was nearly eaten through with rust; but as the wind was calm it did not matter. Next time the ship came there to anchor the cod-fish looked again; and the rust had gone still further into the link. A third time the ship came back to anchor there, and the sailors went to sleep thinking it was all right, but the cod-fish swam by and saw that the link only just held. In the night there came a storm, and the sailors woke up to find the vessel drifting on the rocks, where she was broken to pieces, and hardly any of them escaped.",sea cod fish tell seagull tell heron relate fact kingfisher inform cod -fish swim sea see ship anchor come chain cable fish see link chain eat rust wind calm matter next time ship come anchor cod fish look rust go link third time ship come anchor sailor go sleep think right cod -fish swim see link hold night come storm sailor wake find vessel drift rock break piece escape 
60,"""Also, with living things, Bevis dear; for there was once a little creeping thing (the sun-beetle told me he heard it from his grandfather) which bored a hole into a beam under the floor of a room--the hole was so tiny you could scarcely see it, and the beam was so big twenty men could not lift it. After the creeping thing had bored this little hole it died, but it left ten children, and they bored ten more little holes, and when they died they left ten each, and they bored a hundred holes, and left a thousand, and they bored a thousand holes, and they left a thousand tens, who bored ten thousand holes, and left ten thousand tens, and they bored one hundred thousand holes, and left one hundred thousand tens, and they bored a million holes; and when a great number of people met in the room to hear a man speak, down the beam fell crash, and they were all dreadfully injured.",living thing dear be little creep thing sun beetle tell hear grandfather bored hole beam floor room hole tiny see beam big man lift creep thing bored little hole die leave child bored more little hole die leave bored hole leave bored hole leave ten bored hole leave ten bored hole leave ten bored hole great number person meet room hear man speak beam fall crash injure 
61,"""Now, therefore, Bevis, my dear little Sir Bevis, do you take great care and never think any more that a thing cannot hurt you, because it has not got any legs, and cannot run after you, or because it has no hands, and cannot catch you, or because it is very tiny, and you cannot see it, but could kill a thousand with the heel of your boot.

62,"""Therefore, if you climb up a tree, be sure and remember to hold tight, and not forget, for the earth will not forget, but will pull you down to it thump, and hurt you very much. And remember if you walk by the water that it is water, and do not forget, for the water will not forget, and if you should fall in, will let you sink and drown you. And if you take a candle be careful what you are doing, and do not forget that fire will burn, for the fire will not forget, but will always be on the look-out and ready, and will burn you without mercy. And be sure to see that no little unseen creeping thing is at work, for they are everywhere boring holes into the beam of life till it cracks unexpectedly; but you must stay till you are older, and have eaten the peck of salt your papa tells you about, before you can understand all that. Now----""",climb tree sure remember hold tight forget earth forget pull thump hurt remember walk water water forget water forget fall let sink drown take candle careful do forget fire burn fire forget look ready burn mercy sure see little unseen creep thing work boring hole beam life crack stay old eat peck salt papa tell understand 
63,"""But,"" said Bevis, who had been listening to the story very carefully, ""you have not told me about the wind. You have told me about the earth, and the water, and the fire, but you have not said anything about the wind.""",say listen story tell wind tell earth water fire say wind 
64,"""No more I have,"" said the squirrel. ""You see I forget, though the earth does not, neither does the water, nor the fire. Well, the wind is the nicest of all of them, and you need never be afraid of the wind, for he blows so sweetly, and brings the odour of flowers, and fills you with life, and joy, and happiness. And oh, Bevis dear, you should listen to the delicious songs he sings, and the stories he tells as he goes through the fir-tree and the oak. Of course if you are on the ground, so far below, you can only hear a sound of whispering, unless your ears are very sharp; but if you were up in the boughs with me, you would be enchanted with the beauty of his voice.",more say squirrel see forget earth water fire wind nice afraid wind blow bring odour flower fill life joy happiness dear listen delicious song sing story tell go fir tree oak course ground hear sound whispering ear sharp bough enchant beauty voice 
65,"""No, dear, never be afraid of the wind, but put your doors open and let him come in, and throw your window open and let him wander round the room, and take your cap off sometimes, and let him stroke your hair. The wind is a darling--I love the wind, and so do you, dear, for I have seen you racing about when the wind was rough, chasing the leaves and shouting with delight. Now with the wind it is just the reverse to what it is with all the others. If you fall on the earth it thumps you; into the water, it drowns you; into the fire, it burns you; but you cannot do without wind.",dear afraid wind put door open let come throw window open let wander room take cap let stroke hair wind darling love wind dear see racing wind rough chase leave shouting delight wind reverse other fall earth thump water drown fire burn do wind 
66,"""Always remember that you must have wind, dear, and do not get into a drawer, as I have heard of boys doing, from the mouse, who goes about a good deal indoors, and being suffocated for want of wind; or into a box, or a hole, or anywhere where there is no wind. It is true he sometimes comes along with a most tremendous push, and the trees go cracking over. That is only because they are malice-minded, and are rotten at the heart; and the boughs break off, that is only because they have invited the fungus to grow on them; and the thatch on your papa's ricks is lifted up at the corner just as if the wind had chucked them under the chin.",remember have wind dear get drawer hear boy do mouse go good deal suffocate want wind box hole be wind true come tremendous push tree go crack malice minded rotten heart bough break invite fungus grow thatch papa rick lift corner wind chuck chin 
67,"""But that is nothing. Everybody loses his temper now and then, and why not the wind? You should see the nuts he knocks down for me where I could not very well reach them, and the showers of acorns, and the apples! I take an apple out of your orchard, dear, sometimes, but I do not mean any harm--it is only one or two. I love the wind! But do not go near an elm, dear, when the wind blows, for the elm, as I told you, is a malicious tree, and will seize any pretence, or a mere puff, to do mischief.""",lose temper wind see nut knock reach shower acorn apple take apple orchard dear mean harm love wind go elm dear wind blow elm tell malicious tree seize pretence mere puff do mischief 
68,"""I love the wind too!"" said Bevis. ""He sings to me down the chimney, and hums to me through the door, and whistles up in the attic, and shouts at me from the trees. Oh, yes, I will do as you say; I will always have plenty of the wind. You are a very nice squirrel. I like you very much; and you have a lovely silky tail. But you have not told me yet who it is Kapchack is in love with.""",love wind say sing chimney hum door whistle attic shout tree do say have plenty wind nice squirrel like have lovely silky tail tell love 
69,"""I have been telling you all the time,"" said the squirrel; ""but you are in such a hurry; and, as I was saying, if it was only a young magpie, now--only an ordinary affair--very likely the queen would be jealous, indeed, and there would be a fight in the palace, which would be nothing at all new, but this is much more serious, a very serious matter, and none can tell how it will end. As Kauc, the crow, was saying to Cloctaw, the jackdaw, this morning----""",tell time say squirrel hurry say young magpie ordinary affair likely queen jealous be fight palace new serious serious matter tell end crow say jackdaw morning 
70,"""But who is it?"" asked Bevis, jumping up again in a rage.",ask jump rage 
71,"""Why, everybody knows who it is,"" said the squirrel; ""from the ladybird to the heron; from the horse to the mouse; and everybody is talking of it, and as since the raven went away, there is no judge to settle any dispute----""",know say squirrel ladybird heron horse mouse talk raven go be judge settle dispute 
72,"""I hate you!"" said Bevis, ""you do talk so much; but you do not tell me what I want to know. You are a regular donkey, and I will pull your tail.""",hate say talk tell want know regular donkey pull tail 
73,"He snatched at the squirrel's tail, but the squirrel was too quick; he jumped up the boughs and showed his white teeth, and ran away in a temper.",snatch squirrel tail squirrel quick jump bough show white tooth run temper 
74,"Bevis looked all round, but could not see him, and as he was looking a dragon-fly came and said that the squirrel had sent him to say that he was very much hurt, and thought Bevis was extremely rude to him, but he had told the dragon-fly to show him the way to the piece of timber, and if he would come back to-morrow, and not be so rude, he should hear all about it. So the dragon-fly led Bevis to the piece of timber, where the hare was waiting, and the hare led him to the wheat-field, and showed him the top of the great oak-tree, and from there he easily found his way home to tea.",look see look dragon fly come say squirrel send say hurt think rude tell dragon fly show way piece timber come rude hear dragon fly lead piece timber hare wait hare lead wheat field show top great oak tree find way tea
