3,"Our voyage during the next two weeks was most interesting and prosperous. The breeze continued generally fair, and at all times enabled us to lie our course; for being, as I have said before, clipper-built, the pirate schooner could lie very close to the wind, and made little lee-way.  We had no difficulty now in managing our sails, for Jack was heavy and powerful, while Peterkin was active as a kitten.  Still, however, we were a very insufficient crew for such a vessel, and if any one had proposed to us to make such a voyage in it before we had been forced to go through so many hardships from necessity, we would have turned away with pity from the individual making such proposal as from a madman.  I pondered this a good deal, and at last concluded that men do not know how much they are capable of doing till they try, and that we should never give way to despair in any undertaking, however difficult it may seem:--always supposing, however, that our cause is a good one, and that we can ask the divine blessing on it.",voyage next week interesting prosperous breeze continue fair time enable lie course say clipper build pirate schooner lie wind make little lee way have difficulty manage sail heavy powerful active kitten insufficient crew vessel one propose make voyage force go many hardship necessity turn pity individual make such proposal madman ponder good deal last conclude man know much capable do try give way despair undertaking difficult seem suppose cause good one ask divine blessing 
4,"Although, therefore, we could now manage our sails easily, we nevertheless found that my pulleys were of much service to us in some things; though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth arrangement of ropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor's eye, a very lumbering and clumsy appearance.  But I will not drag my reader through the details of this voyage.  Suffice it to say, that, after an agreeable sail of about three weeks, we arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at once from the description that the pirate, Bill, had given me of it during one of our conversations.",manage sail find pulley much service thing laugh uncouth arrangement rope block sailor eye lumbering clumsy appearance drag reader detail voyage suffice say agreeable sail week arrive island recognise description pirate give conversation 
5,"As soon as we came within sight of it we hove the ship to, and held a council of war.",come sight hove ship hold council war 
6,"""Now, boys,"" said Jack, as we seated ourselves beside him on the cabin sky-light, ""before we go farther in this business, we must go over the pros and cons of it; for, although you have so generously consented to stick by me through thick and thin, it would be unfair did I not see that you thoroughly understand the danger of what we are about to attempt.""",boy say seat cabin sky light go business go pro con consent stick thick thin unfair see understand danger about attempt 
7,"""Oh! bother the danger,"" cried Peterkin; ""I wonder to hear _you_, Jack, talk of danger.  When a fellow begins to talk about it, he'll soon come to magnify it to such a degree that he'll not be fit to face it when it comes, no more than a suckin' baby!""",bother danger cry wonder hear talk danger fellow begin talk come magnify degree fit face come more suckin' baby 
8,"""Nay, Peterkin,"" replied Jack, gravely, ""I won't be jested out of it.  I grant you, that, when we've once resolved to act, and have made up our minds what to do, we should think no more of danger.  But, before we have so resolved, it behoves us to look at it straight in the face, and examine into it, and walk round it; for if we flinch at a distant view, we're sure to run away when the danger is near.  Now, I understand from you, Ralph, that the island is inhabited by thorough-going, out-and-out cannibals, whose principal law is--'Might is right, and the weakest goes to the wall?'""",reply jest grant resolve act make mind do think more danger resolve behove look face examine walk flinch distant view sure run danger understand island inhabit thorough go cannibal principal law right weak go wall 
9,"""Yes,"" said I, ""so Bill gave me to understand.  He told me, however, that, at the southern side of it, the missionaries had obtained a footing amongst an insignificant tribe.  A native teacher had been sent there by the Wesleyans, who had succeeded in persuading the chief at that part to embrace Christianity.  But instead of that being of any advantage to our enterprise, it seems the very reverse; for the chief Tararo is a determined heathen, and persecutes the Christians,--who are far too weak in numbers to offer any resistance,--and looks with dislike upon all white men, whom he regards as propagators of the new faith.""",say give understand tell southern side missionary obtain footing insignificant tribe native teacher send succeed persuade chief part embrace advantage enterprise seem very reverse chief determined heathen persecute weak number offer resistance look dislike white man regard propagator new faith 
10,"""'Tis a pity,"" said Jack, ""that the Christian tribe is so small, for we shall scarcely be safe under their protection, I fear.  If Tararo takes it into his head to wish for our vessel, or to kill ourselves, he could take us from them by force.  You say that the native missionary talks English?""",tis pity say christian tribe small safe protection fear take head wish vessel kill take force say native missionary talk 
11,"""So I believe.""",believe 
12,"""Then, what I propose is this,"" said Jack: ""We will run round to the south side of the island, and cut anchor off the Christian village.  We are too far away just now to have been descried by any of the savages, so we shall get there unobserved, and have time to arrange our plans before the heathen tribes know of our presence.  But, in doing this, we run the risk of being captured by the ill-disposed tribes, and being very ill used, if not--a--""",propose say run south side island cut anchor christian village descry savage get unobserve have time arrange plan heathen tribe know presence do run risk capture ill dispose tribe ill use

14,"""Well, that is the worst of it, certainly.  Are you prepared, then, to take your chance of that?""",bad prepare take chance 
15,"""I've been prepared and had my mind made up long ago,"" cried Peterkin, swaggering about the deck with his hands thrust into his breeches' pockets.  ""The fact is, Jack, I don't believe that Tararo will be so ungrateful as to eat us; and I'm quite sure that he'll be too happy to grant us whatever we ask: so the sooner we go in and win the better.""",prepare have mind make cry swagger deck hand thrust breeche pocket fact believe ungrateful eat sure happy grant ask go win good 
16,"Peterkin was wrong, however, in his estimate of savage gratitude, as the sequel will show.",wrong estimate savage gratitude sequel show 
17,"The schooner was now put before the wind, and, after making a long run to the south'ard, we put about and beat up for the south side of Mango, where we arrived before sunset, and hove-to off the coral reef.  Here we awaited the arrival of a canoe, which immediately put off on our rounding to.  When it arrived, a mild-looking native, of apparently forty years of age, came on board, and, taking off his straw hat, made us a low bow.  He was clad in a respectable suit of European clothes; and the first words he uttered, as he stepped up to Jack and shook hands with him, were,--",schooner put wind make long run south'ard put beat south side arrive sunset hove coral reef await arrival canoe put rounding arrive mild look native year age come board take straw hat make low bow clad respectable suit european clothes first word utter step shake hand 
18,"""Good day, gentlemen; we are happy to see you at Mango--you are heartily welcome.""",good day gentleman happy see welcome

20,"""I am.  I have the joy to be a servant of the Lord Jesus at this station.""",have joy servant station 
21,"""You're the very man I want to see, then,"" replied Jack; ""that's lucky. Come down to the cabin, friend, and have a glass of wine.  I wish particularly to speak with you.

24,"""Now, 'pon my word, that's cool!"" said Peterkin; ""his _men_, forsooth! Well, since we are to be men, we may as well come it as strong over these black chaps as we can.  Hallo, there!"" he cried to the half dozen of natives who stood upon the deck, gazing in wonder at all they saw, ""here's for you;"" and he handed them a tray of broken biscuit and a can of water.  Then, thrusting his hands into his pockets, he walked up and down the deck with an enormous swagger, whistling vociferously.",word cool say man come strong black chap cry half native stand deck gaze wonder see hand tray break biscuit can water thrust hand pocket walk deck enormous swagger whistle 
25,"In about half an hour Jack and the teacher came on deck, and the latter, bidding us a cheerful good evening, entered his canoe and paddled to the shore.  When he was gone, Peterkin stepped up to Jack, and, touching his cap, said,--",hour teacher come deck latter bid cheerful good evening enter canoe paddle shore gone step touch cap say 
26,"""Well, captain, have you any communications to make to your _men_?""",captain have communication make _men_ 
27,"""Yes,"" cried Jack; ""ready about, mind the helm and clew up your tongue, while I con the schooner through the passage in the reef.  The teacher, who seems a first-rate fellow, says it's quite deep, and good anchorage within the lagoon close to the shore.""",cry ready mind helm clew tongue con schooner passage reef teacher seem first rate fellow say deep good anchorage lagoon shore 
28,"While the vessel was slowly advancing to her anchorage, under a light breeze, Jack explained to us that Avatea was still on the island, living amongst the heathens; that she had expressed a strong desire to join the Christians, but Tararo would not let her, and kept her constantly in close confinement.",vessel advance anchorage light breeze explain island live heathen express strong desire join let keep close confinement 
29,"""Moreover,"" continued Jack, ""I find that she belongs to one of the Samoan Islands, where Christianity had been introduced long before her capture by the heathens of a neighbouring island; and the very day after she was taken, she was to have joined the church which had been planted there by that excellent body, the London Missionary Society.  The teacher tells me, too, that the poor girl has fallen in love with a Christian chief, who lives on an island some fifty miles or so to the south of this one, and that she is meditating a desperate attempt at escape.  So, you see, we have come in the nick of time.  I fancy that this chief is the fellow whom you heard of, Ralph, at the Island of Emo.  Besides all this, the heathen savages are at war among themselves, and there's to be a battle fought the day after to-morrow, in which the principal leader is Tararo; so that we'll not be able to commence our negotiations with the rascally chief till the day after.""",continue find belong samoan introduce capture heathen neighbour island very day take join church plant excellent body missionary teacher tell poor girl fall love christian chief live island mile south one meditate desperate attempt escape see come nick time fancy chief fellow hear heathen savage war be be battle fight day principal leader able commence negotiation rascally chief day 
30,"The village off which we anchored was beautifully situated at the head of a small bay, from the margin of which trees of every description peculiar to the tropics rose in the richest luxuriance to the summit of a hilly ridge, which was the line of demarcation between the possessions of the Christians and those of the neighbouring heathen chief.",village anchore situate head small bay margin tree description peculiar tropic rise rich luxuriance summit hilly ridge line demarcation possession neighbour heathen chief 
31,"The site of the settlement was an extensive plot of flat land, stretching in a gentle slope from the sea to the mountain.  The cottages stood several hundred yards from the beach, and were protected from the glare of the sea by the rich foliage of rows of large Barringtonia and other trees, which girt the shore.  The village was about a mile in length, and perfectly straight, with a wide road down the middle, on either side of which were rows of the tufted-topped ti tree, whose delicate and beautiful blossoms, hanging beneath their plume-crested tops, added richness to the scene.  The cottages of the natives were built beneath these trees, and were kept in the most excellent order, each having a little garden in front, tastefully laid out and planted, while the walks were covered with black and white pebbles.",site settlement extensive plot flat land stretch gentle slope sea mountain cottage stand several yard beach protect glare sea rich foliage row large other tree girt shore village mile length straight wide road middle side row tuft top it tree delicate beautiful blossom hang plume crest top add richness scene cottage native build tree keep excellent order have little garden front lay plant walk cover black white pebble 
32,"Every house had doors and Venetian windows, painted partly with lamp black made from the candle-nut, and partly with red ochre, which contrasted powerfully with the dazzling coral lime that covered the walls.  On a prominent position stood a handsome church, which was quite a curiosity in its way.  It was a hundred feet long by fifty broad, and was seated throughout to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons.  It had six large folding doors and twelve windows with Venetian blinds; and, although a large and substantial edifice, it had been built, we were told by the teacher, in the space of two months!  There was not a single iron nail in the fabric, and the natives had constructed it chiefly with their stone and bone axes and other tools, having only one or two axes or tools of European manufacture.  Everything around this beautiful spot wore an aspect of peace and plenty, and, as we dropped our anchor within a stone's cast of the substantial coral wharf, I could not avoid contrasting it with the wretched village of Emo, where I had witnessed so many frightful scenes.  When the teacher afterwards told me that the people of this tribe had become converts only a year previous to our arrival, and that they had been living before that in the practice of the most bloody system of idolatry, I could not refrain from exclaiming, ""What a convincing proof that Christianity is of God!""",house have door venetian window paint lamp black make candle nut red ochre contrast dazzling coral lime cover wall prominent position stand handsome church curiosity way foot seat accommodate upwards person have large fold door window venetian blind large substantial edifice build tell teacher space month be single iron nail fabric native construct stone bone axe other tool have axe tool european manufacture beautiful spot wear aspect peace plenty drop anchor stone cast substantial coral wharf avoid contrast wretched village witness many frightful scene teacher tell person tribe become convert year previous arrival live practice bloody system idolatry refrain exclaim convincing proof 
33,"On landing from our little boat, we were received with a warm welcome by the teacher and his wife; the latter being also a native, clothed in a simple European gown and straw bonnet.  The shore was lined with hundreds of natives, whose persons were all more or less clothed with native cloth.  Some of the men had on a kind of poncho formed of this cloth, their legs being uncovered.  Others wore clumsily-fashioned trousers, and no upper garment except hats made of straw and cloth.  Many of the dresses, both of women and men, were grotesque enough, being very bad imitations of the European garb; but all wore a dress of some sort or other.  They seemed very glad to see us, and crowded round us as the teacher led the way to his dwelling, where we were entertained, in the most sumptuous manner, on baked pig and all the varieties of fruits and vegetables that the island produced.  We were much annoyed, however, by the rats: they seemed to run about the house like domestic animals.  As we sat at table, one of them peeped up at us over the edge of the cloth, close to Peterkin's elbow, who floored it with a blow on the snout from his knife, exclaiming as he did so--",land little boat receive warm welcome teacher wife latter native cloth simple european gown straw bonnet shore line hundred native person more cloth native cloth man have kind poncho form cloth leg uncover other wear fashioned trousers upper garment hat make straw cloth many dress woman man grotesque bad imitation european garb wear dress sort other seem glad see crowd teacher lead way dwelling entertain sumptuous manner bake pig variety fruit vegetable island produce annoyed rat seem run house domestic animal sit table peep edge cloth close elbow floor blow snout knife exclaim

36,"""Are they, then, so numerous?"" inquired Jack.",numerous inquire 
37,"""They swarm everywhere.  The poor heathens on the north side eat them, and think them very sweet.  So did my people formerly; but they do not eat so many now, because the missionary who was last here expressed disgust at it.

I have heard that they are better than cats.""",glad have few rejoin teacher difficult get hog find good rat killer seem able keep number hear good cat 
41,"As the teacher said this, his good-natured black face was wrinkled with a smile of merriment.  Observing that I had noticed it, he said:--",teacher say good natured black face wrinkle smile merriment observe notice say 
42,"""I smiled just now when I remembered the fate of the first cat that was taken to Raratonga.  This is one of the stations of the London Missionary Society.  It, like our own, is infested with rats, and a cat was brought at last to the island.  It was a large black one.  On being turned loose, instead of being content to stay among men, the cat took to the mountains, and lived in a wild state, sometimes paying visits during the night to the houses of the natives; some of whom, living at a distance from the settlement, had not heard of the cat's arrival, and were dreadfully frightened in consequence, calling it a 'monster of the deep,' and flying in terror away from it.  One night the cat, feeling a desire for company, I suppose, took its way to the house of a chief, who had recently been converted to Christianity, and had begun to learn to read and pray.  The chief's wife, who was sitting awake at his side while he slept, beheld with horror two fires glistening in the doorway, and heard with surprise a mysterious voice.  Almost petrified with fear, she awoke her husband, and began to upbraid him for forsaking his old religion, and burning his god, who, she declared, was now come to be avenged of them. 'Get up and pray! get up and pray!' she cried.  The chief arose, and, on opening his eyes, beheld the same glaring lights, and heard the same ominous sound.  Impelled by the extreme urgency of the case, he commenced, with all possible vehemence, to vociferate the alphabet, as a prayer to God to deliver them from the vengeance of Satan!  On hearing this, the cat, as much alarmed as themselves, fled precipitately away, leaving the chief and his wife congratulating themselves on the efficacy of their prayer.""",smile remember fate first cat take station missionary own infest rat cat bring last island large black one turn loose content stay man cat take mountain live wild state pay visit night house native live distance settlement hear cat arrival frighten consequence call monster deep fly terror night cat feel desire company suppose take way house chief convert begin learn read pray chief wife sit side sleep beheld horror fire glisten doorway hear surprise mysterious voice petrified fear awoke husband begin upbraid forsake old religion burn god declare come avenge get pray get pray cry chief arise open eye beheld same glaring light hear same ominous sound impell extreme urgency case commence possible vehemence vociferate alphabet prayer deliver vengeance hear cat alarm flead leave chief wife congratulate efficacy prayer 
43,"We were much diverted with this anecdote, which the teacher related in English so good, that we certainly could not have supposed him a native but for the colour of his face and the foreign accent in his tone.  Next day we walked out with this interesting man, and were much entertained and instructed by his conversation, as we rambled through the cool shady groves of bananas, citrons, limes, and other trees, or sauntered among the cottages of the natives, and watched them while they laboured diligently in the taro beds, or manufactured the tapa or native cloth.  To some of these Jack put questions through the medium of the missionary; and the replies were such as to surprise us at the extent of their knowledge.  Indeed, Peterkin very truly remarked that ""they seemed to know a considerable deal more than Jack himself!""",divert anecdote teacher relate good suppose native colour face foreign accent tone next day walk interesting man entertain instruct conversation ramble cool shady grove banana citron lime other tree saunter cottage native watch laboure taro bed manufacture tapa native cloth put question medium missionary reply such surprise extent knowledge remark seem know considerable deal more 
44,"Among other pieces of interesting information that we obtained was the following, in regard to coral formations:--",other piece interesting information obtain follow regard coral formation 
45,"""The islands of the Pacific,"" said our friend, ""are of three different kinds or classes.  Those of the first class are volcanic, mountainous, and wild; some shooting their jagged peaks into the clouds at an elevation of ten and fifteen thousand feet.  Those of the second class are of crystalized limestone, and vary in height from one hundred to five hundred feet.  The hills on these are not so wild or broken as those of the first class, but are richly clothed with vegetation, and very beautiful.  I have no doubt that the Coral Island on which you were wrecked was one of this class.  They are supposed to have been upheaved from the bottom of the sea by volcanic agency, but they are not themselves volcanic in their nature, neither are they of coral formation. Those of the third class are the low coralline islands usually having lagoons of water in their midst; they are very numerous.",island say friend different kind class first class volcanic mountainous wild shoot jagge peak cloud elevation foot second class crystalize limestone vary height foot hill wild break first class cloth vegetation beautiful have doubt coral wreck class suppose upheave bottom sea volcanic agency volcanic nature coral formation third class low coralline island have lagoon water midst numerous 
46,"""As to the manner in which coral islands and reefs are formed; there are various opinions on this point.  I will give you what seems to me the most probable theory,--a theory, I may add, which is held by some of the good and scientific missionaries.  It is well known that there is much lime in salt water; it is also known that coral is composed of lime.  It is supposed that the polypes, or coral insects, have the power of attracting this lime to their bodies; and with this material they build their little cells or habitations.  They choose the summit of a volcano, or the top of a submarine mountain, as a foundation on which to build; for it is found that they never work at any great depth below the surface.  On this they work; the polypes on the mountain top, of course, reach the surface first, then those at the outer edges reach the top sooner than the others between them and the centre, thus forming the coral reef surrounding the lagoon of water and the central island; after that the insects within the lagoon cease working.  When the surface of the water is reached, these myriads of wonderful creatures die.  Then birds visit the spot, and seeds are thus conveyed thither, which take root, and spring up, and flourish.  Thus are commenced those coralline islets of which you have seen so many in these seas.  The reefs round the large islands are formed in a similar manner.  When we consider,"" added the missionary, ""the smallness of the architects used by our heavenly Father in order to form those lovely and innumerable islands, we are filled with much of that feeling which induced the ancient king to exclaim, 'How manifold, O God, are thy works! in wisdom thou hast made them all.'""",manner coral island reef form be various opinion point give seem probable theory theory add hold good scientific missionary know be much lime salt water know coral compose lime suppose polype coral insect have power attract lime body material build little cell habitation choose summit volcano top submarine mountain foundation build find work great depth surface work polype mountain top course reach surface outer edge reach top other centre form coral reef surround lagoon water central island insect lagoon cease work surface water reach myriad wonderful creature die bird visit spot seed convey take root spring flourish commence coralline islet see many sea reef large island form similar manner consider add missionary smallness architect use heavenly father order form lovely innumerable island fill much feeling induce ancient king exclaim manifold work wisdom make 
47,"We all heartily agreed with the missionary in this sentiment, and felt not a little gratified to find that the opinions which Jack and I had been led to form from personal observation on our Coral Island were thus to a great extent corroborated.",agree missionary sentiment feel little gratified find opinion lead form personal observation coral great extent corroborate 
48,"The missionary also gave us an account of the manner in which Christianity had been introduced among them.  He said: ""When missionaries were first sent here, three years ago, a small vessel brought them; and the chief, who is now dead, promised to treat well the two native teachers who were left with their wives on the island.  But scarcely had the boat which landed them returned to the ship, than the natives began to maltreat their guests, taking away all they possessed, and offering them further violence, so that, when the boat was sent in haste to fetch them away, the clothes of both men and women were torn nearly off their backs.",missionary give account manner introduce say missionary send year small vessel bring chief dead promise treat native teacher leave wife island have boat land return ship native begin maltreat guest take possess offer further violence boat send haste fetch clothes man woman tear back 
49,"""Two years after this the vessel visited them again, and I, being in her, volunteered to land alone, without any goods whatever; begging that my wife might be brought to me the following year,--that is, _this_ year; and, as you see, she is with me.  But the surf was so high that the boat could not land me; so with nothing on but my trousers and shirt, and with a few catechisms and a Bible, besides some portions of the Scripture translated into the Mango tongue, I sprang into the sea, and swam ashore on the crest of a breaker.  I was instantly dragged up the beach by the natives; who, on finding I had nothing worth having upon me, let me alone.  I then made signs to my friends in the ship to leave me; which they did.  At fist the natives listened to me in silence, but laughed at what I said while I preached the gospel of our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ to them.  Afterwards they treated me ill sometimes; but I persevered, and continued to dwell among them, and dispute, and exhort them to give up their sinful ways of life, burn their idols, and come to Jesus.",year vessel visit volunteer land goods begg wife bring follow year _this_ year see surf high boat land trousers shirt few catechism portion translate tongue spring sea swim crest breaker drag beach native find have worth have let make sign friend ship leave fist native listen silence laugh say preach gospel bless treat ill persever continue dwell dispute exhort give sinful way life burn idol come 
50,"""About a month after I landed, I heard that the chief was dead.  He was the father of the present chief, who is now a most consistent member of the church.  It is a custom here that, when a chief dies, his wives are strangled and buried with him.  Knowing this, I hastened to his house to endeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible.  When I arrived, I found two of the wives had already been killed, while another was in the act of being strangled.  I pleaded hard for her, but it was too late; she was already dead.  I then entreated the son to spare the fourth wife; and, after much hesitation, my prayer was granted: but, in half an hour afterwards, this poor woman repented of being unfaithful, as she termed it, to her husband, and insisted on being strangled; which was accordingly done.",month land hear chief dead father present chief consistent member church custom chief die wife strangle bury know hasten house endeavour prevent such cruelty possible arrive find wife kill act strangle plead late dead entreat son spare fourth wife much hesitation prayer grant hour poor woman repent unfaithful term husband insist strangle do

When he entered, I went in with him, and found, to my surprise, that his father was not dead!  The old man was sitting on a mat in a corner, with an expression of placid resignation on his face.",time chief son walk father house brow black thunder enter go find surprise father dead old man sit mat corner expression placid resignation face

54,"""I now remembered having heard that it is a custom among the Feejee islanders, that when the reigning chief grows old or infirm, the heir to the chieftainship has a right to depose his father; in which case he is considered as dead, and is buried alive.  The young chief was now about to follow this custom, and, despite my earnest entreaties and pleadings, the old chief was buried that day before my eyes in the same grave with his four strangled wives!  Oh! my heart groaned when I saw this, and I prayed to God to open the hearts of these poor creatures, as he had already opened mine, and pour into them the light and the love of the gospel of Jesus.  My prayer was answered very soon.  A week afterwards, the son, who was now chief of the tribe, came to me, bearing his god on his shoulders, and groaning beneath its weight.

55,"""You may conceive how overjoyed I was at this.  I sprang up and embraced him, while I shed tears of joy.  Then we made a fire, and burned the god to ashes, amid an immense concourse of the people, who seemed terrified at what was being done, and shrank back when we burned the god, expecting some signal vengeance to be taken upon us; but seeing that nothing happened, they changed their minds, and thought that our God must be the true one after all.  From that time the mission prospered steadily, and now, while there is not a single man in the tribe who has not burned his household gods, and become a convert to Christianity, there are not a few, I hope, who are true followers of the Lamb, having been plucked as brands from the burning by Him who can save unto the uttermost.  I will not tell you more of our progress at this time, but you see,"" he said, waving his hand around him, ""the village and the church did not exist a year ago!""",conceive overjoyed spring embrace shed tear joy make fire burn god ash immense concourse person seem terrified do shrank burn god expect signal vengeance take see happen change mind think true one time mission prosper be single man tribe burn household god become convert be few hope true follower pluck brand burning save uttermost tell more progress time see say wave hand village church exist year 
56,"We were indeed much interested in this account, and I could not help again in my heart praying God to prosper those missionary societies that send such inestimable blessings to these islands of dark and bloody idolatry.  The teacher also added that the other tribes were very indignant at this one for having burned its gods, and threatened to destroy it altogether, but they had done nothing yet; ""and if they should,"" said the teacher, ""the Lord is on our side; of whom shall we be afraid?""",interested account help heart pray prosper missionary society send such inestimable blessing island dark bloody idolatry teacher add other tribe indignant one burn god threaten destroy do say teacher side afraid 
57,"""Have the missionaries many stations in these seas?"" inquired Jack.",have missionary many station sea inquire 
58,"""Oh, yes.  The London Missionary Society have a great many in the Tahiti group, and other islands in that quarter.  Then the Wesleyans have the Feejee Islands all to themselves, and the Americans have many stations in other groups.  But still, my friend, there are hundreds of islands here the natives of which have never heard of Jesus, or the good word of God, or the Holy Spirit; and thousands are living and dying in the practice of those terrible sins and bloody murders of which you have already heard.  I trust, my friends,"" he added, looking earnestly into our faces, ""I trust that if you ever return to England, you will tell your Christian friends that the horrors which they hear of in regard to these islands are _literally true_, and that when they have heard the worst, the '_half has not been told them_;' for there are perpetrated here foul deeds of darkness of which man may not speak.  You may also tell them,"" he said, looking around with a smile, while a tear of gratitude trembled in his eye and rolled down his coal-black cheek,--""tell them of the blessings that the gospel has wrought _here_!""",missionary have great many group other island quarter have have many station other group friend be hundred island native hear good word holy thousand live die practice terrible sin bloody murder hear trust friend add look face trust return tell christian friend horror hear regard island true_ hear bad _half tell them_ be perpetrate foul deed darkness man speak tell say look smile tear gratitude tremble eye roll coal black cheek tell blessing gospel wring _here_

60,"""That is owing to the lime with which they are plastered,"" said the teacher.  ""When the natives were converted, as I have described, I set them to work to build cottages for themselves, and also this handsome church which you see.  When the framework and other parts of the houses were up, I sent the people to fetch coral from the sea.  They brought immense quantities.  Then I made them cut wood, and, piling the coral above it, set it on fire.",ow lime plaster say teacher native convert describe set work build cottage handsome church see framework other part house send person fetch coral sea bring immense quantity make cut wood pile coral set fire

62,"""But their surprise was still greater when the coral was reduced to a fine soft white powder.  They immediately set up a great shout, and, mingling the lime with water, rubbed their faces and their bodies all over with it, and ran through the village screaming with delight.  They were also much surprised at another thing they saw me do.  I wished to make some household furniture, and constructed a turning-lathe to assist me.  The first thing that I turned was the leg of a sofa; which was no sooner finished than the chief seized it with wonder and delight, and ran through the village exhibiting it to the people, who looked upon it with great admiration.  The chief then, tying a string to it, hung it round his neck as an ornament!  He afterwards told me that if he had seen it before he became a Christian he would have made it his god!""",surprise great coral reduce fine soft white powder set great shout mingle lime water rub face body run village scream delight surprise thing see do wish make household furniture construct turning lathe assist first thing turn leg sofa finish chief seize wonder delight run village exhibit person look great admiration chief tie string hang neck ornament tell see become make god
