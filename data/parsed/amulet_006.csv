4,"The others were tasting the fearful joys of domestic tobogganing. You know how it is done--with the largest and best tea-tray and the surface of the stair carpet. It is best to do it on the days when the stair rods are being cleaned, and the carpet is only held by the nails at the top. Of course, it is one of the five or six thoroughly tip-top games that grown-up people are so unjust to--and old Nurse, though a brick in many respects, was quite enough of a standard grown-up to put her foot down on the tobogganing long before any of the performers had had half enough of it. The tea-tray was taken away, and the baffled party entered the sitting-room, in exactly the mood not to be pleased if they could help it.",other taste fearful joy domestic tobogganing know do large good tea- tray surface stair carpet good do day stair rod clean carpet hold nail top course tip top game grow person unjust old brick many respect enough standard grow put foot tobogganing performer have half enough tea tray take baffle party enter sitting room mood pleased help

8,"It was a wet day, so none of the plans for seeing all the sights of London that can be seen for nothing could be carried out. Everyone had been thinking all the morning about the wonderful adventures of the day before, when Jane had held up the charm and it had turned into an arch, through which they had walked straight out of the present time and the Regent’s Park into the land of Egypt eight thousand years ago. The memory of yesterday’s happenings was still extremely fresh and frightening, so that everyone hoped that no one would suggest another excursion into the past, for it seemed to all that yesterday’s adventures were quite enough to last for at least a week. Yet each felt a little anxious that the others should not think it was afraid, and presently Cyril, who really was not a coward, began to see that it would not be at all nice if he should have to think himself one.

They may have been brought from Asia. Or, supposing the charm to have been fashioned in Egypt, it might very well have been carried to Babylon by some friendly embassy, or brought back by the Babylonish army from some Egyptian campaign as part of the spoils of war. The inscription may be much later than the charm. Oh yes! it is a pleasant fancy, that that splendid specimen of yours was once used amid Babylonish surroundings.’ The others looked at each other, but it was Jane who spoke.",possible learn gentleman reply such charm find early egyptian tomb origin determine egyptian bring suppose charm fashioned carry friendly embassy bring army egyptian campaign part spoil war inscription late charm pleasant fancy splendid specimen use surroundings other look other speak

67,"‘Ah,’ said the learned gentleman, smiling rather sadly, ‘one can go so far in dreams, when one is young.’ He sighed again, and then adding with a laboured briskness, ‘I hope you’ll have a--a--jolly game,’ he went into his room and shut the door.",say learn gentleman smile go dream young sigh add laboure briskness hope have jolly game go room shut door

Outside the arch was the bedroom painted chest-of-drawers and the Kidderminster carpet, and the washhand-stand with the riveted willow-pattern jug, and the faded curtains, and the dull light of indoors on a wet day. Through the arch showed the gleam of soft green leaves and white blossoms. They stepped forward quite happily. Even Jane felt that this did not look like lions, and her hand hardly trembled at all as she held the charm for the others to go through, and last, slipped through herself, and hung the charm, now grown small again, round her neck.",say speak charm grow arch tall top close bedroom ceiling arch bedroom paint chest drawer carpet washhand stand rivet willow pattern jug fade curtain dull light wet day arch show gleam soft green leave white blossom step feel look lion hand tremble hold charm other go last slip hang charm grow small neck 
76,"The children found themselves under a white-blossomed, green-leafed fruit-tree, in what seemed to be an orchard of such trees, all white-flowered and green-foliaged. Among the long green grass under their feet grew crocuses and lilies, and strange blue flowers. In the branches overhead thrushes and blackbirds were singing, and the coo of a pigeon came softly to them in the green quietness of the orchard.",child find white blossom green leaf fruit tree seem orchard such tree white flower green foliage long green grass foot grow crocuse lilie strange blue flower branch overhead thrushe blackbird sing coo pigeon come green quietness orchard

83,"They began to walk through the cool grass. As far as they could see was nothing but trees, and trees and more trees. At the end of their orchard was another one, only separated from theirs by a little stream of clear water. They jumped this, and went on. Cyril, who was fond of gardening--which meant that he liked to watch the gardener at work--was able to command the respect of the others by telling them the names of a good many trees. There were nut-trees and almond-trees, and apricots, and fig-trees with their big five-fingered leaves. And every now and then the children had to cross another brook.",begin walk cool grass see tree tree more tree end orchard one separate little stream clear water jump go fond gardening mean like watch gardener work able command respect other tell name good many tree be nut tree almond tree apricot fig tree big finger leave child have cross brook

88,"And now in front of them they could see a great mass of buildings. There were scattered houses of wood and stone here and there among green orchards, and beyond these a great wall that shone red in the early morning sun. The wall was enormously high--more than half the height of St Paul’s--and in the wall were set enormous gates that shone like gold as the rising sun beat on them. Each gate had a solid square tower on each side of it that stood out from the wall and rose above it. Beyond the wall were more towers and houses, gleaming with gold and bright colours. Away to the left ran the steel-blue swirl of a great river. And the children could see, through a gap in the trees, that the river flowed out from the town under a great arch in the wall.",front see great mass building be scatter house wood stone green orchard great wall shine red early morning sun wall high more height wall set enormous gate shine gold rise sun beat gate have solid square tower side stand wall rise wall more tower house gleam gold bright colour left run steel blue swirl great river child see gap tree river flow town great arch wall

Not that they were all alike, for though all were squarish, they were of different sizes, and decorated in all sorts of different ways, some with paintings in bright colours, some with black and silver designs. There were terraces, and gardens, and balconies, and open spaces with trees.

Some had great creatures carved in stone at each side of the door.

There were pineapples and peaches in heaps--and stalls of crockery and glass things, beautiful shapes and glorious colours, there were stalls for necklaces, and clasps, and bracelets, and brooches, for woven stuffs, and furs, and embroidered linen.
