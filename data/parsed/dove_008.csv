3,"When she heard that the marriage was to be a secret, she had not understood that Eberhard was by no means disposed to observe much more caution than mere silence.  A rough, though kindly man, he did not thoroughly comprehend the shame and confusion that he was bringing upon her by departing from his former demeanour.  He knew that, so enormous was the distance then supposed to exist between the noble and the burgher, there was no chance of any one dreaming of the true state of the case, and that as long as Christina was not taken for his wife, there was no personal danger for her from his mother, who—so lax were the morals of the German nobility with regard to all of inferior rank—would tolerate her with complacency as his favourite toy; and he was taken by surprise at the agony of grief and shame with which she slowly comprehended his assurance that she had nothing to fear.",hear marriage secret understand means dispose observe more caution mere silence rough kindly man comprehend shame confusion bring depart former demeanour know enormous distance suppose exist noble burgher be chance one dreaming true state case take wife be personal danger mother lax moral german nobility regard inferior rank tolerate complacency favourite toy take surprise agony grief shame comprehend assurance have fear 
4,"There was no help for it.  The oubliette would probably be the portion of the low-born girl who had interfered with the sixteen quarterings of the Adlerstein shield, and poor Christina never stepped across its trap-door without a shudder lest it should open beneath her.  And her father would probably have been hung from the highest tower, in spite of his shrewd care to be aware of nothing.  Christina consoled herself with the hope that he knew all the time why he had been sent out of the way, for, with a broad grin that had made her blush painfully, he had said he knew she would be well taken care of, and that he hoped she was not breaking her heart for want of an escort.  She tried to extort Eberhard’s permission to let him at least know how it was; but Eberhard laughed, saying he believed the old fox knew just as much as he chose; and, in effect, Sorel, though now and then gratifying his daughter’s scruples, by serving as a shield to her meetings with the young Baron, never allowed himself to hear a hint of the true state of affairs.",be help oubliette portion low bear girl interfer quartering shield poor step trap door shudder open father hang high tower spite shrewd care aware console hope know time send way broad grin make blush say know take care hope break heart want escort try extort permission let least know laugh say believe old fox know much choose effect gratify daughter scruple serve shield meeting young allow hear hint true state affair 
5,"Eberhard’s love and reverence were undiminished, and the time spent with him would have been perfectly happy could she ever have divested herself of anxiety and alarm; but the periods of his absence from the castle were very terrible to her, for the other women of the household, quick to perceive that she no longer repelled him, had lost that awe that had hitherto kept them at a distance from her, and treated her with a familiarity, sometimes coarse, sometimes spiteful, always hateful and degrading.  Even old Ursel had become half-pitying, half-patronizing; and the old Baroness, though not molesting her, took not the slightest notice of her.",love reverence undiminished time spend happy divest anxiety alarm period absence castle terrible other woman household quick perceive repell lose awe keep distance treat familiarity coarse spiteful hateful degrading old become half pitying half patronize old molest take slight notice 
6,"This state of things lasted much longer than there had been reason to expect at the time of the marriage.  The two Freiherren then intended to set out in a very short time to make their long talked-of submission to the Emperor at Ratisbon; but, partly from their German tardiness of movement, partly from the obstinate delays interposed by the proud old Freiherrinn, who was as averse as ever to the measure, partly from reports that the Court was not yet arrived at Ratisbon, the expedition was again and again deferred, and did not actually take place till September was far advanced.",state thing last be reason expect time marriage intend set short time make long talk submission emperor german tardiness movement obstinate delay interpose proud old averse measure report arrive expedition deferre take place advance 
7,"Poor Christina would have given worlds to go with them, and even entreated to be sent to Ulm with an avowal of her marriage to her uncle and aunt, but of this Eberhard would not hear.  He said the Ulmers would thus gain an hostage, and hamper his movements; and, if her wedding was not to be confessed—poor child!—she could better bear to remain where she was than to face Hausfrau Johanna.  Eberhard was fully determined to enrol himself in some troop, either Imperial, or, if not, among the Free Companies, among whom men of rank were often found, and he would then fetch or send for his wife and avow her openly, so soon as she should be out of his mother’s reach.  He longed to leave her father at home, to be some protection to her, but Hugh Sorel was so much the most intelligent and skilful of the retainers as to be absolutely indispensable to the party—he was their only scribe; and moreover his new suit of buff rendered him a creditable member of a troop that had been very hard to equip.  It numbered about ten men-at-arms, only three being left at home to garrison the castle—namely, Hatto, who was too old to take; Hans, who had been hopelessly lame and deformed since the old Baron had knocked him off a cliff in a passion; and Squinting Mätz, a runaway servant, who had murdered his master, the mayor of Strasburg, and might be caught and put to death if any one recognized him.  If needful the villagers could always be called in to defend the castle: but of this there was little or no danger—the Eagle’s Steps were defence enough in themselves, and the party were not likely to be absent more than a week or ten days—a grievous length of time, poor Christina thought, as she stood straining her eyes on the top of the watch-tower, to watch them as far as possible along the plain.  Her heart was very sad, and the omen of the burning wheel so continually haunted her that even in her sleep that night she saw its brief course repeated, beheld its rapid fall and extinction, and then tracked the course of the sparks that darted from it, one rising and gleaming high in air till it shone like a star, another pursuing a fitful and irregular, but still bright course amid the dry grass on the hillside, just as she had indeed watched some of the sparks on that night, minding her of the words of the Allhallow-tide legend: “_Fulgebunt justi et tanquam scintillæ in arundinete discurrent_”—a sentence which remained with her when awake, and led her to seek it out in her Latin Bible in the morning.",poor give world go entreat send avowal marriage uncle aunt hear say gain hostage hamper movement wedding confess poor child bear remain face determined enrol troop free company man rank find fetch send wife avow mother reach long leave father home protection intelligent skilful retainer indispensable party only scribe new suit buff render creditable member troop hard equip number man arm leave home garrison castle old take lame deform old knock cliff passion squint runaway servant murder master mayor catch put death one recognize needful villager call defend castle be little danger step defence party likely absent more week day grievous length time poor think stand strain eye top watch tower watch possible plain heart sad omen burning wheel haunt sleep night see brief course repeat beheld rapid fall extinction track course spark dart rising gleam high air shine star pursue fitful irregular bright course dry grass hillside watch spark night mind word tide legend sentence remain awake lead seek latin morning 
8,"Reluctantly had she gone down to the noontide meal, feeling, though her husband and father were far less of guardians than they should have been, yet that there was absolute rest, peace, and protection in their presence compared with what it was to be alone with Freiherrinn Kunigunde and her rude women without them.  A few sneers on her daintiness and uselessness had led her to make an offer of assisting in the grand chopping of sausage meat and preparation of winter stores, and she had been answered with contempt that my young lord would not have her soil her delicate hands, when one of the maids who had been sent to fetch beer from the cellar came back with startled looks, and the exclamation, “There is the Schneiderlein riding up the Eagle’s Ladder upon Freiherr Ebbo’s white mare!”",go noontide meal feel husband father less guardian be absolute rest peace protection presence compare alone rude woman few sneer daintiness uselessness lead make offer assist grand chop sausage meat preparation winter store answer contempt young lord have soil delicate hand maid send fetch beer cellar come startle look exclamation be ride white mare 
9,"All the women sprang up together, and rushed to the window, whence they could indeed recognize both man and horse; and presently it became plain that both were stained with blood, weary, and spent; indeed, nothing but extreme exhaustion would have induced the man-at-arms to trust the tired, stumbling horse up such a perilous path.",woman spring rush window recognize man horse become plain stain blood weary spend extreme exhaustion induce man arm trust tired stumble horse perilous path

12,“All was certain to go wrong when a pale mist widow came into the place.”,certain go wrong pale mist widow come place 
13,"The angry and dismayed cries all blended themselves in confusion in the ears of the only silent woman present; the only one that sounded distinctly on her brain was that of the last speaker, “A pale, mist widow,” as, holding herself a little in the rear of the struggling, jostling little mob of women, who hardly made way even for their acknowledged lady, she followed with failing limbs the universal rush to the entrance as soon as man and horse had mounted the slope and were lost sight of.",angry dismay cry blend confusion ear only silent woman present only one sound brain last speaker pale mist widow hold little rear struggle jostle little mob woman make way acknowledge lady follow fail limb universal rush entrance man horse mount slope lose sight 
14,"A few moments more, and the throng of expectants was at the foot of the hall steps, just as the lanzknecht reached the arched entrance.  His comrade Hans took his bridle, and almost lifted him from his horse; he reeled and stumbled as, pale, battered, and bleeding, he tried to advance to Freiherinn Kunigunde, and, in answer to her hasty interrogation, faltered out, “Ill news, gracious lady.  We have been set upon by the accursed Schlangenwaldern, and I am the only living man left.”",few moment more throng expectant foot hall step lanzknecht reach arched entrance comrade take bridle lift horse reel stumble pale batter bleeding try advance answer hasty interrogation falter ill news gracious lady set accurse only living man leave 
15,"Christina scarce heard even these last words; senses and powers alike failed her, and she sank back on the stone steps in a deathlike swoon.",scarce hear last word sense power fail sink stone step deathlike swoon 
16,"When she came to herself she was lying on her bed, Ursel and Else, another of the women, busy over her, and Ursel’s voice was saying, “Ah, she is coming round.  Look up, sweet lady, and fear not.  You are our gracious Lady Baroness.”",come lie bed woman busy voice say come look sweet lady fear gracious 
17,"“Is he here?  O, has he said so?  O, let me see him—Sir Eberhard,” faintly cried Christina with sobbing breath.",say let see cry sobb breath 
18,"“Ah, no, no,” said the old woman; “but see here,” and she lifted up Christina’s powerless, bloodless hand, and showed her the ring on the finger.  Her bosom had been evidently searched when her dress was loosened in her swoon, and her ring found and put in its place.  “There, you can hold up your head with the best of them; he took care of that—my dear young Freiherr, the boy that I nursed,” and the old woman’s burst of tears brought back the truth to Christina’s reviving senses.",say old woman see lift powerless bloodless hand show ring finger bosom search dress loosen swoon ring find put place hold head good take care dear young boy nurse old woman burst tear bring truth revive sense 
19,"“Oh, tell me,” she said, trying to raise herself, “was it indeed so?  O say it was not as he said!”",tell say try raise say say 
20,"“Ah, woe’s me, woe’s me, that it was even so,” lamented Ursel; “but oh, be still, look not so wild, dear lady.  The dear, true-hearted young lord, he spent his last breath in owning you for his true lady, and in bidding us cherish you and our young baron that is to be.  And the gracious lady below—she owns you; there is no fear of her now; so vex not yourself, dearest, most gracious lady.”",lament look wild dear lady dear true hearted young lord spend last breath own true lady bid cherish young baron gracious lady own be fear vex dearest gracious lady 
21,"Christina did not break out into the wailing and weeping that the old nurse expected; she was still far too much stunned and overwhelmed, and she entreated to be told all, lying still, but gazing at Ursel with piteous bewildered eyes.  Ursel and Else helping one another out, tried to tell her, but they were much confused; all they knew was that the party had been surprised at night in a village hostel by the Schlangenwaldern, and all slain, though the young Baron had lived long enough to charge the Schneiderlein with his commendation of his wife to his mother; but all particulars had been lost in the general confusion.",break wail weeping old nurse expect stunn overwhelm entreat tell lie gaze piteous bewilder eye help try tell confused know party surprise night village hostel slain young live charge commendation wife mother particular lose general confusion 
22,"“Oh, let me see the Schneiderlein,” implored Christina, by this time able to rise and cross the room to the large carved chair; and Ursel immediately turned to her underling, saying, “Tell the Schneiderlein that the gracious Lady Baroness desires his presence.”",let see implore time able rise cross room large carve chair turn underling say tell gracious desire presence 
23,"Else’s wooden shoes clattered down stairs, but the next moment she returned.  “He cannot come; he is quite spent, and he will let no one touch his arm till Ursel can come, not even to get off his doublet.”",wooden shoe clatter stair next moment return come spend let touch arm come get doublet 
24,"“I will go to him,” said Christina, and, revived by the sense of being wanted, she moved at once to the turret, where she kept some rag and some ointment, which she had found needful in the latter stages of Ermentrude’s illness—indeed, household surgery was a part of regular female education, and Christina had had plenty of practice in helping her charitable aunt, so that the superiority of her skill to that of Ursel had long been avowed in the castle.  Ursel made no objection further than to look for something that could be at once converted into a widow’s veil—being in the midst of her grief quite alive to the need that no matronly badge should be omitted—but nothing came to hand in time, and Christina was descending the stairs, on her way to the kitchen, where she found the fugitive man-at-arms seated on a rough settle, his head and wounded arm resting on the table, while groans of pain, weariness, and impatience were interspersed with imprecations on the stupid awkward girls who surrounded him.",go say revive sense want move turret keep rag ointment find needful latter stage illness household surgery part regular female education have plenty practice help charitable aunt superiority skill avow castle make objection look convert widow veil midst grief alive need matronly badge omit come hand time descend stair way kitchen find fugitive man arm seat rough settle head wound arm rest table groan pain weariness impatience intersperse imprecation stupid awkward girl surround 
25,"Pity and the instinct of affording relief must needs take the precedence even of the desire to hear of her husband’s fate; and, as the girls hastily whispered, “Here she is,” and the lanzknecht hastily tried to gather himself up, and rise with tokens of respect; she bade him remain still, and let her see what she could do for him.  In fact, she at once perceived that he was in no condition to give a coherent account of anything, he was so completely worn out, and in so much suffering.  She bade at once that some water should be heated, and some of the broth of the dinner set on the fire; then with the shears at her girdle, and her soft, light fingers, she removed the torn strip of cloth that had been wound round the arm, and cut away the sleeve, showing the arm not broken, but gashed at the shoulder, and thence the whole length grazed and wounded by the descent of the sword down to the wrist.  So tender was her touch, that he scarcely winced or moaned under her hand; and, when she proceeded, with Ursel’s help, to bathe the wound with the warm water, the relief was such that the wearied man absolutely slumbered during the process, which Christina protracted on that very account.  She then dressed and bandaged the arm, and proceeded to skim—as no one else in the castle would do—the basin of soup, with which she then fed her patient as he leant back in the corner of the settle, at first in the same somnolent, half-conscious state in which he had been ever since the relief from the severe pain; but after a few spoonfuls the light and life came back to his eye, and he broke out, “Thanks, thanks, gracious lady! This is the Lady Baroness for me!  My young lord was the only wise man! Thanks, lady; now am I my own man again.  It had been long ere the old Freiherrinn had done so much for me!  I am your man, lady, for life or death!”  And, before she knew what he was about, the gigantic Schneiderlein had slid down on his knees, seized her hand, and kissed it—the first act of homage to her rank, but most startling and distressing to her.  “Nay,” she faltered, “prithee do not; thou must rest.  Only if—if thou canst only tell me if he, my own dear lord, sent me any greeting, I would wait to hear the rest till thou hast slept.”",pity instinct afford relief need take precedence desire hear husband fate girl whisper lanzknecht try gather rise token respect bid remain let see do fact perceive condition give coherent account wear much suffering bid water heat broth dinner set fire shear girdle soft light finger remove tear strip cloth wind arm cut sleeve show arm break gash shoulder thence whole length graze wound descent sword wrist tender touch wince moan hand proceed help bathe wound warm water relief such weary man slumber process protract very account dress bandage arm proceed ske else castle do basin soup feed patient lean corner settle first same somnolent half conscious state relief severe pain few spoonful light life come eye break thanks thanks gracious lady young lord only wise man thanks lady own man long old do much man lady life death know gigantic slide knee seize hand kiss first act homage rank startling distressing falter rest tell own dear lord send greeting wait hear rest sleep 
26,"“Ah! the dog of Schlangenwald!” was the first answer; then, as he continued, “You see, lady, we had ridden merrily as far as Jacob Müller’s hostel, the traitor,” it became plain that he meant to begin at the beginning.  She allowed Ursel to seat her on the bench opposite to his settle, and, leaning forward, heard his narrative like one in a dream. There, the Schneiderlein proceeded to say, they put up for the night, entirely unsuspicious of evil; Jacob Müller, who was known to himself, as well as to Sorel and to the others, assuring them that the way was clear to Ratisbon, and that he heard the Emperor was most favourably disposed to any noble who would tender his allegiance.  Jacob’s liquors were brought out, and were still in course of being enjoyed, when the house was suddenly surrounded by an overpowering number of the retainers of Schlangenwald, with their Count himself at their head.  He had been evidently resolved to prevent the timely submission of the enemies of his race, and suddenly presenting himself before the elder Baron, had challenged him to instantaneous battle, claiming credit to himself for not having surprised them when asleep.  The disadvantage had been scarcely less than if this had been the case, for the Adlersteinern were all half-intoxicated, and far inferior in numbers—at least, on the showing of the Schneiderlein—and a desperate fight had ended by his being flung aside in a corner, bound fast by the ankles and wrists, the only living prisoner, except his young lord, who, having several terrible wounds, the worst in his chest, was left unbound.",dog first answer continue see lady ride hostel traitor become plain mean begin beginning allow seat bench settle lean hear narrative dream proceed say put night unsuspicious evil know other assure way clear hear emperor dispose noble tender allegiance liquor bring course enjoy house surround overpowering number retainer count head resolve prevent timely submission enemy race present elder challenge instantaneous battle claim credit surprise asleep disadvantage less case half intoxicated inferior number least show desperate fight end flung corner bind ankle wrist only living prisoner young lord have several terrible wound bad chest leave unbound 
27,"Both lay helpless, untended, and silent, while the revel that had been so fatal to them was renewed by their captors, who finally all sunk into a heavy sleep.  The torches were not all spent, and the moonlight shone into the room, when the Schneiderlein, desperate from the agony caused by the ligature round his wounded arm, sat up and looked about him.  A knife thrown aside by one of the drunkards lay near enough to be grasped by his bound hands, and he had just reached it when Sir Eberhard made a sign to him to put it into his hand, and therewith contrived to cut the rope round both hands and feet—then pointed to the door.",lay helpless untended silent revel fatal renew captor sink heavy sleep torche spend moonlight shine room desperate agony cause ligature wound arm sit look knife throw drunkard lay grasp bound hand reach make sign put hand contrived cut rope hand foot point door 
28,"There was nothing to hinder an escape; the men slept the sleep of the drunken; but the Schneiderlein, with the rough fidelity of a retainer, would have lingered with a hope of saving his master.  But Eberhard shook his head, and signed again to escape; then, making him bend down close to him, he used all his remaining power to whisper, as he pressed his sword into the retainer’s hand,—",be hinder escape man sleep sleep drunken rough fidelity retainer linger hope save master shake head sign escape make bend use remain power whisper press sword retainer hand 
29,"“Go home; tell my mother—all the world—that Christina Sorel is my wife, wedded on the Friedmund Wake by Friar Peter of Offingen, and if she should bear a child, he is my true and lawful heir.  My sword for him—my love to her.  And if my mother would not be haunted by me, let her take care of her.”",go home tell mother world wife wedd bear child true lawful heir sword love mother haunt let take care 
30,"These words were spoken with extreme difficulty, for the nature of the wound made utterance nearly impossible, and each broken sentence cost a terrible effusion of blood.  The final words brought on so choking and fatal a gush that, said the Schneiderlein, “he fell back as I tried to hold him up, and I saw that it was all at an end, and a kind and friendly master and lord gone from me.  I laid him down, and put his cross on his breast that I had seen him kissing many a time that evening; and I crossed his hands, and wiped the blood from them and his face.  And, lady, he had put on his ring; I trust the robber caitiff’s may have left it to him in his grave.  And so I came forth, walking soft, and opening the door in no small dread, not of the snoring swine, but of the dogs without.  But happily they were still, and even by the door I saw all our poor fellows stark and stiff.”",word speak extreme difficulty nature wound make utterance impossible break sentence cost terrible effusion blood final word bring choke fatal gush say fall try hold see end kind friendly master lord go lay put cross breast see kiss time evening cross hand wipe blood face lady put ring trust robber caitiff leave grave come walk soft open door small dread snoring swine dog door see poor fellow stark stiff 
31,“My father?” asked Christina.,father ask 
32,"“Ay! with his head cleft open by the Graf himself.  He died like a true soldier, lady, and we have lost the best head among us in him.  Well, the knave that should have watched the horses was as drunken as the rest of them, and I made a shift to put the bridle on the white mare and ride off.”",head cleft open die true soldier lady lose good head knave watch horse drunken rest make shift put bridle white mare ride 
33,"Such was the narrative of the Schneiderlein, and all that was left to Christina was the picture of her husband’s dying effort to guard her, and the haunting fancy of those long hours of speechless agony on the floor of the hostel, and how direful must have been his fears for her.  Sad and overcome, yet not sinking entirely while any work of comfort remained, her heart yearned over her companion in misfortune, the mother who had lost both husband and son; and all her fears of the dread Freiherrinn could not prevent her from bending her steps, trembling and palpitating as she was, towards the hall, to try whether the daughter-in-law’s right might be vouchsafed to her, of weeping with the elder sufferer.",such narrative leave picture husband die effort guard haunting fancy long hour speechless agony floor hostel direful fear sad overcome sink work comfort remain heart yearn companion misfortune mother lose husband son fear dread prevent bending step tremble palpitate hall try daughter law right vouchsafe weep elder sufferer 
34,"The Freiherrinn sat by the chimney, rocking herself to and fro, and holding consultation with Hatto.  She started as she saw Christina approaching, and made a gesture of repulsion; but, with the feeling of being past all terror in this desolate moment, Christina stepped nearer, knelt, and, clasping her hands, said, “Your pardon, lady.”",sit chimney rock for hold consultation start see approach make gesture repulsion feeling terror desolate moment step knolt clasp hand say pardon lady 
35,"“Pardon!” returned the harsh voice, even harsher for very grief, “thou hast naught to fear, girl.  As things stand, thou canst not have thy deserts.  Dost hear?”",pardon return harsh voice harsh grief naught fear girl thing stand have desert hear 
36,"“Ah, lady, it was not such pardon that I meant.  If you would let me be a daughter to you.”",lady such pardon mean let daughter 
37,"“A daughter!  A wood-carver’s girl to be a daughter of Adlerstein!” half laughed the grim Baroness.  “Come here, wench,” and Christina underwent a series of sharp searching questions on the evidences of her marriage.",daughter wood carver girl daughter half laugh grim come wench underwent series sharp searching question evidence marriage 
38,"“So,” ended the old lady, “since better may not be, we must own thee for the nonce.  Hark ye all, this is the Frau Freiherrinn, Freiherr Eberhard’s widow, to be honoured as such,” she added, raising her voice. “There, girl, thou hast what thou didst strive for.  Is not that enough?”",end old lady good own nonce hark widow honoure such add raise voice girl strive enough

41,"And, more desolate than ever, the crushed and broken-hearted Christina, a widow before she had been owned a wife, returned to the room that was now so full of memories as to be even more home than Master Gottfried’s gallery at Ulm.",desolate crush break hearted widow own wife return room full memory more home gallery
