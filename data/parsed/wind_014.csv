1,CHAPTER XIV. OLD DIAMOND,old diamond 
2," AFTER this Diamond recovered so fast, that in a few days he was quite able to go home as soon as his father had a place for them to go. Now his father having saved a little money, and finding that no situation offered itself, had been thinking over a new plan. A strange occurrence it was which turned his thoughts in that direction. He had a friend in the Bloomsbury region, who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen. This man, happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application, said to him:",recover few day able go father have place go father save little money find situation offer think new plan strange occurrence turn thought direction have friend region live let cab horse cabmen man happen meet day return unsuccessful application say

5,"“You must have saved a goodish bit, I should think. Just come home with me now and look at a horse I can let you have cheap. I bought him only a few weeks ago, thinking he’d do for a Hansom, but I was wrong. He’s got bone enough for a waggon, but a waggon ain’t a Hansom. He ain’t got go enough for a Hansom. You see parties as takes Hansoms wants to go like the wind, and he ain’t got wind enough, for he ain’t so young as he once was. But for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages, he’s the very horse. He’d carry a small house any day. I bought him cheap, and I’ll sell him cheap.”",save goodish bit think come look horse let have cheap buy few week think do wrong get bone waggon waggon get go see party take want go wind get wind young wheeler take family luggage very horse carry small house day buy cheap sell cheap

8,"“Since I lost my own old pair, as was Mr. Coleman’s,” said Diamond’s father, turning to accompany the cab-master, “I ain’t almost got the heart to look a horse in the face.

13,"“Who says he ain’t handsome? He’s one of the handsomest horses a gentleman’s coachman ever druv,” said Diamond’s father; remarking to himself under his breath--“though I says it as shouldn’t”--for he did not feel inclined all at once to confess that his own old horse could have sunk so low.",say handsome handsomest horse gentleman coachman druv say father remark breath say feel inclined confess own old horse sink low

15,"But the coachman had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes. For the old horse, hearing his voice, had turned his long neck, and when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side, he whinnied for joy, and laid his big head on his master’s breast. This settled the matter. The coachman’s arms were round the horse’s neck in a moment, and he fairly broke down and cried. The cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that, but he saw in a moment how it was. And he must have been a good-hearted fellow, for I never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell: instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him, he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him, saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends.",coachman have lump throat tear eye old horse hear voice turn long neck old friend go lay hand side whinie joy lay big head master breast settle matter coachman arm horse neck moment break cry cab master fond horse hug see moment good hearted fellow hear idea come head other man horse sell put price sure sell take pound mean ask say shame part old friend

21,"“No, not so much. I bought him cheap, and as I say, he ain’t for my work.”",much buy cheap say work 
22,"The end of it was that Diamond’s father bought old Diamond again, along with a four-wheeled cab. And as there were some rooms to be had over the stable, he took them, wrote to his wife to come home, and set up as a cabman.",end father buy old wheel cab be room have stable take write wife come set cabman
