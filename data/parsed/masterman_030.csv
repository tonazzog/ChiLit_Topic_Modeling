1,CHAPTER 30.,
2,"When they all rose up the next morning, the clouds had cleared off, and the sun was shining bright.  Ready and Juno were the first out of the house--Ready with the telescope under his arm, which he always took with him when he went his rounds, as he termed it, in the morning.",rise next morning cloud clear sun shine bright ready first house ready telescope arm take go round term morning 
3,"""Well, Juno,"" said Ready, ""this is a fine morning after the rain.""",say ready fine morning rain 
4,"""Yes, Massa Ready, very fine morning; but how I get fire light, and make kittle boil for breakfast, I really don't know--stick and cocoa-nut trash all so wet.""",ready fine morning get fire light make boil breakfast know stick cocoa nut trash wet 
5,"""Before I went to bed last night, Juno, I covered up the embers with ashes, put some stones over them, and then some cocoa-nut branches, so I think you will find some fire there yet.  I was going my morning's round, but I will stay a little and help you.""",go bed last night cover ember ash put stone cocoa nut branch think find fire go morning round stay little help 
6,"""Tank you, Massa Ready; plenty rain fell last night.""",tank ready plenty rain fall last night 
7,"""Yes, not a little, Juno; you must not expect to find the water at the well very clear this morning; indeed, I doubt if you will see the well at all.  Here's some stuff which is not very wet.""",little expect find water clear morning doubt see stuff wet 
8,"""I got plenty of fire, too,"" replied Juno, who had removed the branches and stones, and was now on her knees blowing up the embers.",get plenty fire reply remove branch stone knee blow ember 
9,"""You'll do very well now, Juno,"" said Ready; ""besides, William will be out directly--so I'll leave you.""",do say ready leave 
10,"Ready whistled to the dogs, who came bounding out, and then set off on his round of inspection.  He first directed his steps to the well in the ravine; but, instead of the gushing spring and the limpid clear water, with which the cask sunk for a well had been filled, there was now a muddy torrent, rushing down the ravine, and the well was covered with it, and not to be distinguished.",ready whistle dog come bound set round inspection direct step ravine gush spring limpid clear water cask sink fill be muddy torrent rush ravine cover distinguish 
11,"""I thought as much,"" said Ready, musing over the impetuous stream; ""well, better too much water than too little.""  Ready waded through, as he wished to examine the turtle-pond, which was on the other side of the stream.  Finding all right, he again crossed the water, where it was now spread wide over the sandy beach, until he came to the other point where he had moored his boat, both by the head and stern, with a rope, and a heavy stone made fast to it, as an anchor.",think much say ready muse impetuous stream good much water little ready wade wish examine turtle pond other side stream find right cross water spread sandy beach come other point moor boat head stern rope heavy stone make anchor 
12,"From this point, as usual, he surveyed the horizon with his telescope; not that he thought that there was a chance of a vessel arriving among these islands; but, still, as it was possible, he took the trouble; but never except when he went out in the morning alone, as he was aware that the very circumstance of his so doing would make Mr Seagrave melancholy and unsettled.  As usual, he dropped the telescope on his arm, after his survey, saying to himself, ""Little use doing that.""",point usual survey horizon telescope think be chance vessel arrive island possible take trouble go morning aware very circumstance do make melancholy unsettled usual drop telescope arm survey say little use do 
13,"The gale having blown offshore, the boat had dragged her moorings, and was so far out that Ready could not get at her.",gale blow boat drag mooring ready get 
14,"""Here's a puzzle,"" said the old man; ""how foolish of me not to have made a line fast to the shore!  I'll not trust myself to John Shark by swimming to the boat.""",puzzle say old man foolish make line shore trust swim boat 
15,"""Let me see.""  Ready took the halyards and sheets belonging to the boat's sails, which he had left on the beach, and bent one on to the other until he had sufficient length of rope.  He then made a piece of wood, about two feet long, fast by the middle to the end of the rope, and, after one or two attempts, contrived to throw it into the boat. The piece of wood caught under one of the thwarts, and this enabled him to draw the boat to the shore.",let see ready take halyard sheet belong boat sail leave beach bend other have sufficient length rope make piece wood foot long fast middle end rope attempt contrive throw boat piece wood catch thwart enable draw boat shore 
16,"Having baled out the water which had fallen into her during the storm, he then landed again and examined the garden.",bale water fall storm land examine garden 
17,"""Now to find the sheep and goats,"" said Ready, ""and then my morning's walk is over.  Now, Romulus, now, Remus, boys, find them out,"" continued he; and the dogs, who appeared to know what he was in search of, went away in pursuit, and soon found the sheep and two of the goats, but the third goat was not with them.",find sheep goat say ready morning walk boy find continue dog appear know search go pursuit find sheep goat third goat 
18,"""Why, where can Black Nanny be?"" muttered Ready, stopping a little while; at last he heard a bleat, in a small copse of brushwood, to which he directed his steps, followed by the dogs.  ""I thought as much,"" said he, as he perceived Nanny lying down in the copse with two new-born kids at her side.  ""Come, my little fellows, we must find some shelter for you,"" said he, taking one up under each arm.  ""Come, Nanny.""",black mutter ready stop little while last hear bleat small copse brushwood direct step follow dog think much say perceive lie copse new bear kid side come little fellow find shelter say take arm come 
19,"Ready walked back to the house, and brought in the kids, followed by Nanny.  He found Mr and Mrs Seagrave and the children all dressed. Caroline and Tommy gave a scream of delight when they saw the little kids, and even little Albert clapped his hands.  As soon as Ready put them down on the ground, Tommy and Caroline had each their arms round one.",ready walk house bring kid follow find child dress give scream delight see little kid little clapp hand ready put ground have arm 
20,"""I've brought an addition to our family, Mrs Seagrave,"" said Ready: ""we must allow them to remain in the house until I can knock up a little shelter for them.  This is only a beginning; I expect we shall soon have more.""",bring addition family say ready allow remain house knock little shelter beginning expect have more 
21,"As soon as the children could be persuaded to part with the kids, Nanny was tied up in a corner, and was very content with fondling and nursing her progeny.  Juno and William brought in the breakfast, and as soon as it was over, Mr Seagrave said, ""Now, Ready, I think we must hold a council, and make arrangements as to our allotted duties and employments during the rainy season.  We have a great deal to do, and must not be idle.""",child persuade part kid tie corner content fondling nurse progeny bring breakfast say ready think hold council make arrangement allot duty employment rainy season have great deal do idle 
22,"""Yes, sir, we have a great deal to do, and, to get through our work, we must have order and method in our doings.  I've lived long enough to know how much can be done by regularity and discipline.  Why, sir, there is more work got out of men in a well-conducted man-of-war than there can in the merchant service in double the time.  And why so?  Because everything is in its place, and there is a place for everything.""",sir have great deal do get work have order method doing live know much do regularity discipline sir be more work get man conduct man war merchant service double time place be place 
23,"""I agree with you,"" said Mrs Seagrave; ""method is everything.  While one careless little girl is looking for her thimble, another will have finished her work.""",agree say method careless little girl look thimble finish work 
24,"""I assure you I never should have known what can be done by order and arrangement, if I had not been pressed on board of a man-of-war.  I found that everything was done in silence.  Every man was to his post; everyone had a rope to haul upon, or a rope to let go; the boatswain piped, and in a few seconds every sail was set or taken in as was required.  It seemed to me at first like magic.  And you observe, Mr Seagrave, that when there is order and discipline, every man becomes of individual importance.  If I learnt nothing else on board of a man-of-war, I learnt to make the most of time, and the most of the strength which you could command.""",assure know do order arrangement press board man war find do silence man post have rope haul rope let go boatswain pipe few second sail set take require seem first magic observe be order discipline man become individual importance learn else board man war learn make most time most strength command 
25,"""You are very right, Ready; you must teach us to do the same,"" replied Mr Seagrave.",right ready teach do same reply 
26,"""We have so much to do, that I hardly know where to begin; yet, sir, we must work at present how we can, and when we can, until we have got things into a little better order.  We have done well up to the present.""",have much do know begin sir work present get thing little good order do present 
27,"""What do you think we ought to do first?""",think do 
28,"""Well, sir, our first job will be to haul up the boat and secure her from harm; we will half-dock her in the sand, and cover her over, for I do not think it will be safe to go in her now to the other side of the island, where the sea will always be rough.""",sir first job haul boat secure harm half dock sand cover think safe go other side island sea rough 
29,"""There I perfectly agree with you.  Now what is the next?""",agree next 
30,"""Why, sir, we must not leave the tents where they are, but take them down, and as soon as they are dry, stow them away, for we may want them by and by; then, sir, we must build a large outhouse for our stores and provisions, with a thatched roof, and a floor raised about four feet from the ground; and then, under the floor, the sheep and goats will have a protection from the weather.  Then there is the fish-pond to make, and also a salt-pan to cut out of the rock.  Then we have two more long jobs.  One is, to go through the woods and examine the stores we have left on the other side of the island, sort and arrange them all ready for bringing here after the rains are over; and we must also explore the island a little, and find out what it produces; for at present we know nothing of it: we may find a great many things useful to us, a great many trees and fruits, and I hope and trust we may be able to find some more grass for our live stock.""",sir leave tent take dry stow want sir build large outhouse store provision thatch roof floor raise foot ground floor sheep goat have protection weather be fish pond make salt pan cut rock have more long job go wood examine store leave other side island sort arrange ready bring rain explore island little find produce present know find great many thing useful great many tree fruit hope trust able find more grass live stock 
31,"""I agree with you in all you say, Ready,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""now how shall we divide our strength?""",agree say ready reply divide strength 
32,"""We will not divide at present, sir, if you please.  Juno has plenty to do indoors with Mrs Seagrave; William, and you, and I, will first secure the boat and stow away the tents and gear; after that, we will set about the outbuilding, and work at it when we can.  If Juno has any time to spare, she had better collect the cocoa-nut leaves, and pile them up for fuel; and Tommy will, I dare say, go with her, and show her how to draw them along.""",divide present sir have plenty do secure boat stow tent gear set outbuilding work have time spare collect cocoa nut leave pile fuel dare say go show draw 
33,"""Yes, I'll show her,"" said Tommy, getting on his feet.",show say get foot 
34,"""Not just now, Tommy,"" said Ready, ""but as soon as your mamma can spare her to go with you.  Come, sir, a few hours of weather like this is not to be lost,"" continued Ready; ""we shall have more rain before the day is over, I expect.  I will first go to the tent for the shovels; then I will haul the boat round to the beach and meet you there.  You and William can take some cord, tie up a large bundle of cocoa-nut boughs, sling it to the wheels, and draw it down to the beach and meet me.""",say ready mamma spare go come sir few hour weather lose continue ready have more rain day expect go tent shovel haul boat beach meet take cord tie large bundle cocoa nut bough sling wheel draw beach meet
