1,CHAPTER IV. Tweedledum And Tweedledee,
2,"They were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the other’s neck, and Alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them had ‘DUM’ embroidered on his collar, and the other ‘DEE.’ ‘I suppose they’ve each got “TWEEDLE” round at the back of the collar,’ she said to herself.",stand tree arm other neck know moment have dum’ embroider collar other suppose get back collar say 
3,"They stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was just looking round to see if the word “TWEEDLE” was written at the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked ‘DUM.’",stand forget alive look see word write back collar startle voice come one mark 
4,"‘If you think we’re wax-works,’ he said, ‘you ought to pay, you know. Wax-works weren’t made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!’",think wax work say pay know wax work make look 
5,"‘Contrariwise,’ added the one marked ‘DEE,’ ‘if you think we’re alive, you ought to speak.’",add one mark think alive speak 
6,"‘I’m sure I’m very sorry,’ was all Alice could say; for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and she could hardly help saying them out loud:--",sure sorry say word old song keep ring head ticking clock help say 
7,      ‘Tweedledum and Tweedledee       Agreed to have a battle;      For Tweedledum said Tweedledee       Had spoiled his nice new rattle.,agree have battle say spoiled nice new rattle 
8,"     Just then flew down a monstrous crow,       As black as a tar-barrel;      Which frightened both the heroes so,       They quite forgot their quarrel.’",fly monstrous crow black tar barrel frighten hero forget quarrel 
9,"‘I know what you’re thinking about,’ said Tweedledum: ‘but it isn’t so, nohow.’",know think say 
10,"‘Contrariwise,’ continued Tweedledee, ‘if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn’t, it ain’t. That’s logic.’",continue logic 
11,"‘I was thinking,’ Alice said very politely, ‘which is the best way out of this wood: it’s getting so dark. Would you tell me, please?’",think say good way wood get dark tell 
12,But the little men only looked at each other and grinned.,little man look other grin 
13,"They looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that Alice couldn’t help pointing her finger at Tweedledum, and saying ‘First Boy!’",look couple great schoolboy help point finger say first 
14,"‘Nohow!’ Tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with a snap.",cry shut mouth snap 
15,"‘Next Boy!’ said Alice, passing on to Tweedledee, though she felt quite certain he would only shout out ‘Contrariwise!’ and so he did.",next boy say pass feel certain shout 
16,"‘You’ve been wrong!’ cried Tweedledum. ‘The first thing in a visit is to say “How d’ye do?” and shake hands!’ And here the two brothers gave each other a hug, and then they held out the two hands that were free, to shake hands with her.",wrong cry first thing visit say shake hand brother give other hug hold hand free shake hand 
17,"Alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear of hurting the other one’s feelings; so, as the best way out of the difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they were dancing round in a ring. This seemed quite natural (she remembered afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one across the other, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.",like shake hand fear hurt other one feeling good way difficulty take hold hand next moment dance ring seem natural remember surprised hear music play seem come tree dance do make branch rub other fiddle fiddle stick 
18,"‘But it certainly WAS funny,’ (Alice said afterwards, when she was telling her sister the history of all this,) ‘to find myself singing “HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH.” I don’t know when I began it, but somehow I felt as if I’d been singing it a long long time!’",funny say tell sister history find sing go know begin feel sing long long time 
19,"The other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. ‘Four times round is enough for one dance,’ Tweedledum panted out, and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same moment.",other dancer fat breath time enough dance pant leave dancing begin music stop same moment 
20,"Then they let go of Alice’s hands, and stood looking at her for a minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as Alice didn’t know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. ‘It would never do to say “How d’ye do?” NOW,’ she said to herself: ‘we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!’",let go hand stand look minute be awkward pause know begin conversation person dance do say d’ye say seem get

24,"‘Ye-es, pretty well--SOME poetry,’ Alice said doubtfully. ‘Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?’",poetry say tell road lead wood 
25,"‘What shall I repeat to her?’ said Tweedledee, looking round at Tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing Alice’s question.",repeat say look great solemn eye notice question

30,"Tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:",smile begin 
31,"     ‘The sun was shining on the sea,       Shining with all his might:      He did his very best to make       The billows smooth and bright--      And this was odd, because it was       The middle of the night.",sun shine sea shine do good make billow smooth bright odd middle night 
32,"     The moon was shining sulkily,       Because she thought the sun      Had got no business to be there       After the day was done--      “It’s very rude of him,” she said,       “To come and spoil the fun!”",moon shine think sun get business day do rude say come spoil fun 
33,"     The sea was wet as wet could be,       The sands were dry as dry.      You could not see a cloud, because       No cloud was in the sky:      No birds were flying over head--       There were no birds to fly.",sea wet wet sand dry dry see cloud cloud sky bird fly head be bird fly 
34,"     The Walrus and the Carpenter       Were walking close at hand;      They wept like anything to see       Such quantities of sand:      “If this were only cleared away,”        They said, “it WOULD be grand!”",walk close hand goot see such quantity sand clear say grand 
35,"     “If seven maids with seven mops       Swept it for half a year,      Do you suppose,” the Walrus said,       “That they could get it clear?”       “I doubt it,” said the Carpenter,       And shed a bitter tear.",maid mop swept year suppose say get clear doubt say shed bitter tear 
36,"     “O Oysters, come and walk with us!”        The Walrus did beseech.      “A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,       Along the briny beach:      We cannot do with more than four,       To give a hand to each.”",o oyster come walk beseech pleasant walk pleasant talk briny beach do more give hand 
37,"     The eldest Oyster looked at him.       But never a word he said:      The eldest Oyster winked his eye,       And shook his heavy head--      Meaning to say he did not choose       To leave the oyster-bed.",old look word say old wink eye shake heavy head mean say choose leave oyster bed 
38,"     But four young oysters hurried up,       All eager for the treat:      Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,       Their shoes were clean and neat--      And this was odd, because, you know,       They hadn’t any feet.",young oyster hurry eager treat coat brush face wash shoe clean neat odd know have foot 
39,"     Four other Oysters followed them,       And yet another four;      And thick and fast they came at last,       And more, and more, and more--      All hopping through the frothy waves,       And scrambling to the shore.",other follow thick fast come last more more more hopping frothy wave scramble shore 
40,"     The Walrus and the Carpenter       Walked on a mile or so,      And then they rested on a rock       Conveniently low:      And all the little Oysters stood       And waited in a row.",walk mile rest rock low little oyster stand wait row 
41,"     “The time has come,” the Walrus said,       “To talk of many things:      Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--       Of cabbages--and kings--      And why the sea is boiling hot--       And whether pigs have wings.”",time come say talk many thing shoe ship sealing wax cabbage king sea boil hot pig have wing 
42,"     “But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried,       “Before we have our chat;      For some of us are out of breath,       And all of us are fat!”       “No hurry!” said the Carpenter.       They thanked him much for that.",wait bit cry have chat breath fat hurry say thank much 
43,"     “A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said,       “Is what we chiefly need:      Pepper and vinegar besides       Are very good indeed--      Now if you’re ready Oysters dear,       We can begin to feed.”",loaf bread say need pepper vinegar good ready oyster dear begin feed 
44,"     “But not on us!” the Oysters cried,       Turning a little blue,      “After such kindness, that would be       A dismal thing to do!”       “The night is fine,” the Walrus said       “Do you admire the view?",cry turn little blue such kindness dismal thing do night fine say admire view 
45,     “It was so kind of you to come!       And you are very nice!”       The Carpenter said nothing but       “Cut us another slice:      I wish you were not quite so deaf--       I’ve had to ask you twice!”,kind come nice say cut slice wish deaf have ask 
46,"     “It seems a shame,” the Walrus said,       “To play them such a trick,      After we’ve brought them out so far,       And made them trot so quick!”       The Carpenter said nothing but       “The butter’s spread too thick!”",seem shame say play trick bring make trot quick say butter spread thick 
47,"     “I weep for you,” the Walrus said.       “I deeply sympathize.”       With sobs and tears he sorted out       Those of the largest size.      Holding his pocket handkerchief       Before his streaming eyes.",weep say sympathize sob tear sort large size holding pocket handkerchief stream eye 
48,"     “O Oysters,” said the Carpenter.       “You’ve had a pleasant run!      Shall we be trotting home again?”        But answer came there none--      And that was scarcely odd, because       They’d eaten every one.’",say have pleasant run trot answer come odd eat one 
49,"‘I like the Walrus best,’ said Alice: ‘because you see he was a LITTLE sorry for the poor oysters.’",like good say see little sorry poor oyster

52,"‘But he ate as many as he could get,’ said Tweedledum.",eat many get say 
53,"This was a puzzler. After a pause, Alice began, ‘Well! They were BOTH very unpleasant characters--’ Here she checked herself in some alarm, at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast. ‘Are there any lions or tigers about here?’ she asked timidly.",puzzler pause begin unpleasant character check alarm hear sound puffing large steam engine wood fear likely wild beast be lion tiger ask 
54,"‘It’s only the Red King snoring,’ said Tweedledee.",red snoring say

56,‘Isn’t he a LOVELY sight?’ said Tweedledum.,lovely sight say 
57,"Alice couldn’t say honestly that he was. He had a tall red night-cap on, with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap, and snoring loud--‘fit to snore his head off!’ as Tweedledum remarked.",say have tall red night cap tassel lie crumple sort untidy heap snore fit snore head remark

73,‘I hope you don’t suppose those are real tears?’ Tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt.,hope suppose real tear interrupt tone great contempt 
74,"‘I know they’re talking nonsense,’ Alice thought to herself: ‘and it’s foolish to cry about it.’ So she brushed away her tears, and went on as cheerfully as she could. ‘At any rate I’d better be getting out of the wood, for really it’s coming on very dark. Do you think it’s going to rain?’",know talk nonsense think foolish cry brush tear go rate get wood come dark think go rain

78,"‘Selfish things!’ thought Alice, and she was just going to say ‘Good-night’ and leave them, when Tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist.",selfish thing think go say good night leave spring umbrella seize wrist 
79,"‘Do you see THAT?’ he said, in a voice choking with passion, and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.",see say voice choke passion eye grow large yellow moment point tremble finger small white thing lie tree 
80,"‘It’s only a rattle,’ Alice said, after a careful examination of the little white thing. ‘Not a rattleSNAKE, you know,’ she added hastily, thinking that he was frightened: ‘only an old rattle--quite old and broken.’",rattle say careful examination little white thing rattlesnake know add think frighten old rattle old broken 
81,"‘I knew it was!’ cried Tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair. ‘It’s spoilt, of course!’ Here he looked at Tweedledee, who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under the umbrella.",know cry begin stamp tear hair spoil course look sit ground try hide umbrella

84,"All this time Tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella, with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it quite took off Alice’s attention from the angry brother. But he couldn’t quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes--‘looking more like a fish than anything else,’ Alice thought.",time try good fold umbrella extraordinary thing do take attention angry brother succeed end roll bundle umbrella head lay open shut mouth large eye look fish else think 
85,‘Of course you agree to have a battle?’ Tweedledum said in a calmer tone.,course agree have battle say calmer tone 
86,"‘I suppose so,’ the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the umbrella: ‘only SHE must help us to dress up, you know.’",suppose other reply crawl umbrella help dress know 
87,"So the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets, hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. ‘I hope you’re a good hand at pinning and tying strings?’ Tweedledum remarked. ‘Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.’",brother go hand hand wood return minute arm full thing such bolster blanket hearth rug table cloth dish cover coal scuttle hope good hand pin tie string remark thing get go other 
88,"Alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons--‘Really they’ll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else, by the time they’re ready!’ she said to herself, as she arranged a bolster round the neck of Tweedledee, ‘to keep his head from being cut off,’ as he said.",say see fuss make life way bustle quantity thing put trouble give tie string fastening button bundle old clothes else time ready say arrange bolster neck keep head cut say 
89,"‘You know,’ he added very gravely, ‘it’s one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get one’s head cut off.’",know add serious thing happen battle get head cut 
90,"Alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear of hurting his feelings.",laugh manage turn cough fear hurt feeling 
91,"‘Do I look very pale?’ said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet tied on. (He CALLED it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more like a saucepan.)",look pale say come have helmet tie called helmet look saucepan 
92,"‘Well--yes--a LITTLE,’ Alice replied gently.",little reply 
93,"‘I’m very brave generally,’ he went on in a low voice: ‘only to-day I happen to have a headache.’",brave go low voice day happen have headache 
94,"‘And I’VE got a toothache!’ said Tweedledee, who had overheard the remark. ‘I’m far worse off than you!’",get toothache say overhear remark bad

100,"‘And _I_ hit everything within reach,’ cried Tweedledum, ‘whether I can see it or not!’",hit reach cry see

102,"Tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. ‘I don’t suppose,’ he said, ‘there’ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time we’ve finished!’",look satisfied smile suppose say tree leave standing time finish

109,‘It’s the crow!’ Tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.,crow cry shrill voice alarm brother take heel sight moment 
110,"Alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree. ‘It can never get at me HERE,’ she thought: ‘it’s far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees. But I wish it wouldn’t flap its wings so--it makes quite a hurricane in the wood--here’s somebody’s shawl being blown away!’",run little way wood stop large tree get think large squeeze tree wish flap wing make hurricane wood shawl blow
