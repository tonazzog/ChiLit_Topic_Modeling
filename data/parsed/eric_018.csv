Only yesterday Wildney was chatting with Vernon up here (you were out, or Vernon would not have been here) while I was reading; they didn't seem to mind me, and I'm sure you'd have been vexed to the heart if you'd heard how they talked to each other.

33,"They went to ""The Jolly Herring,"" as the pot-house was called, and passed through the dingy beery tap-room into the back parlor, to which Eric had already been introduced by Wildney.

The villainous-low-foreheaded man, whom they called Billy, soon brought in a tough goose at one end of the table, and some fowls at the other; and they fell to, doing ample justice to the [Greek: daiz heisae] while Billy waited on them.

37,"""Now for the dessert, Billy,"" called several voices; and that worthy proceeded to put on the table some figs, cakes, oranges, and four black bottles of wine.

49,"While Wildney sang, Eric had time to think. As he glanced round the room, at the flushed faces of the boys, some of whom he could not recognise in the dusky atmosphere, a qualm of disgust and shame passed over him. Several of them were smoking, and, with Bull and Brigson heading the line on each, side of the table, he could not help observing what a bad set they looked. The remembrance of Russell came back to him. Oh, if Edwin could have known that he was in such company at such a place! And by the door stood Billy, watching them all like an evil spirit, with a leer of saturnine malice on his evil face.",sing have time think glance room flush face boy recognise dusky atmosphere qualm disgust shame pass several smoke head line side table help observe bad set look remembrance come know such company place door stand watch evil spirit leer saturnine malice evil face

51,"Wildney meanwhile was just beginning the next verse, when he was interrupted by a general cry of ""cavé, cavé."" In an instant the room was in confusion; some one dashed the candles upon the floor, the table was overturned with a mighty crash, and plates, glasses, and bottles rushed on to the ground in shivers. Nearly every one bolted for the door, which led through the passage into the street; and in their headlong flight and selfishness, they stumbled over each other, and prevented all egress, several being knocked down and bruised in the crush. Others made for the tap-room; but, as they opened the door leading into it, there stood Mr. Ready and Mr. Gordon! and as it was impossible to pass without being seen, they made no further attempt at escape. All this was the work of a minute. Entering the back parlor, the two masters quickly took down the names of full half the boys who, in the suddenness of the surprise, had been unable to make their exit.",begin next verse interrupt general cry cavé cavé instant room confusion one dash candle floor table overturn mighty crash plate glasses bottle rush ground shiver one bolt door lead passage street headlong flight selfishness stumble other prevent egress several knock bruise crush other make tap room open door lead stand impossible pass see make further attempt escape work minute enter back parlor master take name full boy suddenness surprise unable make exit 
52,And Eric?,
53,"The instant that the candles were knocked over, he felt Wildney seize his hand, and whisper, ""This way all serene;"" following, he groped his way in the dark to the end of the room, where Wildney, shoving aside a green baize curtain, noiselessly opened a door, which at once let them into a little garden. There they both crouched down, under a lilac tree beside the house, and listened intently.",instant candle knock feel seize hand whisper way serene follow grope way dark end room shove green baize curtain open door let little garden crouch lilac tree house listen

57,"It was the dusk of a winter evening when they got out from the close room into the open air, and they had to consider which way they would choose to avoid discovery. They happened to choose the wrong, but escaped by dint of hard running, and Wildney's old short cut. As they ran they passed several boys (who having been caught, were walking home leisurely), and managed to get back undiscovered, when they both answered their names quite innocently at the roll-call, immediately after lock up.",dusk winter evening get close room open air have consider way choose avoid discovery happen choose wrong escape dint hard running old short cut run pass several boy catch walk manage get undiscovered answer name roll call lock

62,"During tea-time Eric was silent, as he felt pretty sure that none of the sixth form or other study boys would particularly sympathise with his late associates. Since the previous evening he had been cool with Duncan, and the rest had long rather despised him as a boy who'd do anything to be popular; so he sat there silent, looking as disdainful as he could, and not touching the tea, for which he felt disinclined after the recent potations. But the contemptuous exterior hid a self-reproving heart, and he felt how far more noble Owen and Montagu were than he.

63,"The master on duty was Mr. Rose, and after tea he left the room for a few minutes while the tables were cleared for ""preparation,"" and the boys were getting out their books and exercises. All the study and class-room boys were expected to go away during this interval; but Eric, not noticing Mr. Rose's entrance, sat gossipping with Wildney about the dinner and its possible consequences to the school.",master duty tea leave room few minute table clear preparation boy get book exercise study class room boy expect go interval notice entrance sit gossipp dinner possible consequence school 
64,"He was sitting on the desk carelessly, with one leg over the other, and bending down towards Wildney.

65,"""Hush! no more talking,"" said Mr. Rose, who did everything very gently and quietly.

For the moment he did not, so Wildney began to chatter again.",talking say do hear inclined linger receive such mild treatment think take much notice delay moment begin chatter

68,"""Williams, go away instantly; what do you mean by staying after I have dismissed you?"" said Mr. Rose sternly.",go mean stay dismiss say 
69,"Every one knew what a favorite Eric had once been, so this speech created a slight titter. The boy heard it just as he was going out of the room, and it annoyed him, and called to arms all his proud and dogged obstinacy. Pretending to have forgotten something, he walked conceitedly back to Wildney, and whispered to him, ""I shan't go if he chooses to speak like that.""",one know favorite speech create slight titter boy hear go room annoy call arm proud dogg obstinacy pretend forget walk whisper go choose speak

71,"Eric was not quite himself, or he would not have acted as he had done. His potations, though not deep, had, with the exciting events of the evening, made his head giddy, and the stroke of the cane, which he had not felt now for two years, roused him to madness. He bounded up, sprang towards Mr. Rose, and almost before he knew what he was about, had wrenched the cane out of his hands, twisted it violently in the middle until it broke, and flung one of the pieces furiously into the fire.",act do potation deep exciting event evening make head giddy stroke cane feel year rouse madness bound spring know wrench cane hand twist middle break flung piece fire

He then banged the door with all his force, and rushed up into his study.",have answer be cane fling other fragment head strode room sweep book table overturn several boy way bang door force rush study

82,"Their eyes met; the boy's false self once more slipped off.

It was rarely now that Eric's thoughts were so rich with the memories of childhood, and sombre with the consciousness of sin, as they were that night, while he gazed on his brother Vernon's face. He did not know what made him look so long and earnestly; an indistinct sorrow, an unconjectured foreboding, passed over his mind, like the shadow of a summer cloud.
