1,CHAPTER 5. THE ISLAND COME TRUE,chapter island come true 
2,"Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and was always used by Peter.",feel way wake life use pluperfect say waken wake good use 
3,"In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething with life.",absence thing quiet island fairy take hour morning beast attend young redskin feed day night pirate lose boy meet bite thumb other coming hate lethargy way put ear ground hear whole island seethe life 
4,"On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. The lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the same rate.",evening chief force island dispose follow lose boy look pirate look lose boy redskin look pirate beast look redskin go island meet go same rate 
5,"All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his hand on his dagger.",want blood boy like rule night greet captain boy island vary course number accord kill seem grow rule thin time be count twin let pretend lie sugar cane watch steal single file hand dagger 
6,"They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear the skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.",forbidden look least wear skin bear slain round furry fall roll become sure footed 
7,"The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if accepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her mischief], and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys. ‘Ware Tinker Bell.",first pass least brave unfortunate gallant band few adventure big thing happen step corner quiet take opportunity go gather few stick firewood return other sweep blood ill luck give gentle melancholy countenance sour nature sweeten humblest boy poor kind be danger air night take care adventure offer accept plunge deep woe tootle fairy bend mischief night look tool do mischief think trick boy 
8,"Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passes by, biting his knuckles.",hear island pass bite knuckle 
9,"Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, [a person who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has he had to deliver up his person when Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who did this thing,” that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.",come gay debonair follow cut whistle tree dance own tune conceited boy think remember day lose manners custom give nose offensive tilt curly fourth pickle person get pickle predicament have deliver person say stand one do thing command stand do last come describe sure describe wrong one know twin band allow know know vague do good give satisfaction keep close apologetic sort way 
10,"The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, for things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:",boy vanish gloom pause long pause thing go island come pirate track hear see same dreadful song 
11,"     “Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,      A-pirating we go,      And if we’re parted by a shot      We’re sure to meet below!”",belay heave pirating go part shot sure meet 
12,"A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop the bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’s brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.",villainous look lot hang row execution dock little advance head ground listen great arm bare piece ear ornament handsome italian cut name letter blood back governor prison gigantic black have many name drop one dusky mother terrify child bank mo inch tattooe same get drop bag moidore portuguese gold piece say black brother prove usher public school dainty way killing irish genial man stab speak offence only crew hand fix many ruffian know fear spanish 
13,"In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous [dead looking] and blackavized [dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long curls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his diction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his demeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of indomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron claw.",midst blackest large dark setting recline write hook say only man fear lay ease rough chariot draw propel man right hand have iron hook anon encourage increase pace dog terrible man treat address dog obey person cadaverous dead look blackavize dark face hair dress long curl little distance look black candle give threatening expression handsome countenance eye blue forget profound melancholy save plung hook time red spot appear light manner grand seigneur cling rip air tell raconteur storyteller repute sinister polite truest test breeding elegance diction swear less distinction demeanour show different cast crew man indomitable courage say only thing shie sight own blood thick unusual colour dress ape attire associate name hear say early period career bear strange resemblance ill fated mouth have holder own contrivance enable smoke cigar grimmest part iron claw 
14,"Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As they pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars from his mouth.",let kill pirate show hook method skylight do pass lurch ruffle lace collar hook shoot be tear sound screech body kick pirate pass take cigar mouth 
15,Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?,such terrible man pit win 
16,"On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful of dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the Piccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns; there is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work this off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.",trail pirate steal war path visible inexperienced eye come redskin eye peel carry tomahawk knife naked body gleam paint oil string scalp boy pirate tribe confuse softer hearted van four great big little brave many scalp present position impede progress bring rear place great danger come erect princess own right beautiful dusky goddess wood belle coquettish flirting cold amorous loving turn be brave have wayward thing wife stave altar hatchet observe pass fall twig make slight noise only sound hear heavy breathing fact little fat heavy gorging time work moment constitute chief danger 
17,"The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.",disappear come shadow place take beast great motley procession lion tiger bear innumerable small savage thing flee kind beast man-eater live cheek jowl favour island tongue hang hungry night 
18,"When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.",pass come last figure gigantic crocodile see look 
19,"The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession must continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.",crocodile pass boy appear procession continue party stop change pace top other 
20,"All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the danger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.",keep sharp look front suspect danger creep show real island 
21,"The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselves down on the sward [turf], close to their underground home.",first fall move circle boy flung sward turf close underground home 
22,"“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than their captain.",wish come say height more breadth large captain 
23,"“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he would come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about Cinderella.”",only one afraid pirate say tone prevent general favourite distant sound disturb add wish come tell hear more 
24,"They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must have been very like her.",talk confident mother 
25,"It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the subject being forbidden by him as silly.",absence speak mother subject forbidden silly 
26,"“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my mother one.”",remember mother tell say father wish have cheque book own know cheque book love give mother 
27,"While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild things of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grim song:",talk hear distant sound wild thing wood hear hear grim song 
28,"     “Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,      The flag o’ skull and bones,      A merry hour, a hempen rope,      And hey for Davy Jones.”",pirate life flag o’ skull bone merry hour hempen rope 
29,At once the lost boys--but where are they? They are no longer there. Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.,lose boy rabbit disappear 
30,"I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home under the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these many moons. Will he find it tonight?",tell exception dart reconnoitre look home ground delightful residence see good deal reach be entrance see much large stone roll disclose mouth cave look note be large tree hole hollow trunk large boy entrance home ground search vain many moon find tonight 
31,"As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw gripped his shoulder.",pirate advance quick eye sight nib disappear wood pistol flash iron claw grip shoulder 
32,"“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.",let go cry writhe 
33,"Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice. “Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.",first time hear voice black voice put pistol say 
34,“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”,boy hate shoot dead 
35,"“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do you want to lose your scalp?”",sound bring redskin want lose scalp 
36,"“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.",ask pathetic tickle have pleasant name cutlass wiggle wound mention many lovable trait instance kill spectacle wipe weapon 
37,"“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.",silent fellow remind 
38,"“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”",say want mischief scatter look 
39,"The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the story of his life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not know in the least.",pirate disappear tree moment alone hook heave heavy sigh know soft beauty evening come desire confide faithful bo’sun story life speak stupid know least 
40,Anon [later] he caught the word Peter.,catch word 
41,"“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain, Peter Pan. ‘Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll tear him!”",most hook say want captain cut arm brandish hook wait shake hand tear 
42,"“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”",say hear say hook worth score hand comb hair other homely use 
43,"“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he frowned.",captain answer mother pray have child bear cast look pride iron hand scorn other frown 
44,"“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened to be passing by.”",flung arm say wince crocodile happen pass 
45,"“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”",have say notice strange dread crocodile 
46,"“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.” He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips for the rest of me.”",crocodile hook correct crocodile lower voice like arm much follow sea sea land land lick lip rest 
47,"“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”",way say sort compliment 
48,"“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”",want such compliment hook bark want give brute taste 
49,"He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me before this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick inside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” He laughed, but in a hollow way.",sit large mushroom be quiver voice say crocodile have lucky chance swallow clock go tick tick reach hear tick bolt laugh hollow way

52,"Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”",sit feel warm say seat hot jump odd bob hammer tong burn 
53,"They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both exclaimed.",examine mushroom size solidity unknown mainland try pull come hand have root strange smoke begin ascend pirate look other chimney exclaim 
54,They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood.,discover chimney home ground custom boy stop mushroom enemy neighbourhood 
55,"Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for so safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.",smoke come come child voice safe boy feel hiding place chatter pirate listen replace mushroom look note hole tree 
56,"“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.",hear say home whisper fidget 
57,"Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. “Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.",hook nod stand long time lose thought last curdle smile light swarthy face wait unrip plan captain cry 
58,"“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it. There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous ‘tis to eat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”",return ship reply tooth cook large rich cake jolly thickness green sugar be room be chimney silly mole sense see need door apiece show have mother leave cake shore boy swim play mermaid find cake goool have mother know dangerous tis eat rich damp cake burst laughter hollow laughter honest laughter die

62,"They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.",begin verse finish sound break still be first tiny sound leaf fall smother come distinct

67,"Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying of them was horrible.",boy emerge open danger night nib rush breathless midst pursue pack wolf tongue pursuer hang baying horrible
