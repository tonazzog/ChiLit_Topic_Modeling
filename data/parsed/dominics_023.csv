1,CHAPTER 22. THE NIGHTINGALE EXAMINATION.,examination 
2,"The next morning early, before breakfast, Oliver joined the Doctor in his study, and made a clean breast to him there and then of Stephen's delinquencies.  He had evidently taken the right step in doing so, for, hearing it all thus frankly confessed by the elder brother, Dr Senior was disposed to take a much more lenient view of the case than he would had the information come to him through any other channel.",next morning breakfast join study make clean breast delinquency take right step do hear confess elder brother dispose take lenient view case have information come other channel 
3,"But at its best the offence was a grave one, and Oliver more than once felt anxious at the sight of the head master's long face during the narrative.  However, when it was all over his fears were at once dispelled by the doctor saying, ""Well, Greenfield, you've done a very proper thing in telling me all this; it is a straightforward as well as a brotherly act.  Your brother seems to have been very foolish, but I have no doubt he has got a lesson.  You had better send him to me after morning service.""",good offence grave one more feel anxious sight head master long face narrative fear dispell doctor say do proper thing tell straightforward brotherly act brother seem foolish have doubt get lesson good send morning service 
4,"And so, much relieved, Oliver went off and reported to the grateful Stephen the success of his mission, and the two boys went off to the school chapel together a good deal more happy than they had been the previous day.",relieve go report grateful success mission boy go school chapel good deal happy previous day 
5,"""I say,"" said Stephen, as they went along, ""I suppose you didn't say anything about Loman, did you?""",say say go suppose say 
6,"""Of course not! he's no concern of mine,"" said Oliver, rather tartly. ""But look here, young 'un, I'm not going to let you fag any more for him, or have anything to do with him.""",course concern say look young go let fig more have do 
7,"""All right!"" said Stephen, who had no desire to continue his acquaintance with his late ""proprietor.""",right say have desire continue acquaintance late proprietor

14,"""Depends on whether I have you.  I don't want any Guinea-pigs in my study, mind.""",depend have want guinea pig study mind 
15,"Stephen's face fell.  For even such a privilege as fagging for Wraysford he could not afford to sever the sacred ties which held him to the fellowship of the Guinea-pigs.  ""I really wouldn't kick-up shines,"" said he, imploringly.",face fall privilege fagg afford sever sacred tie hold fellowship guinea pig kick shine say 
16,"""You'd be a queer Guinea-pig if you didn't!"" was the flattering answer. ""And how many times a week would you go on strike, eh?""",queer guinea pig flattering answer many time week go strike 
17,"""Oh!"" said Stephen, ""I'll never go on strike again; I don't like it.""",say go strike like 
18,"The two friends laughed at this ingenuous admission, and then Wraysford said, ""Well, I'll have you; but mind, I'm awfully particular, and knock my fags about tremendously, don't I, Noll?""",friend laugh ingenuous admission say have mind particular knock fag 
19,"""I don't mind that,"" said the delighted Stephen.  ""Besides, you've not had a fag to knock about!""",mind say delight have fag knock 
20,"At that moment, however, the bell for morning chapel cut short all further talk for the present.  Stephen obeyed its summons for once in a subdued and thankful frame of mind.  Too often had those weekly services been to him occasions of mere empty form, when with his head full of school worries or school fun he had scarcely heard, much less heeded, what was said.",moment bell morning chapel cut short further talk present obey summons subdued thankful frame mind have weekly service occasion mere empty form head full school worry school fun hear heed say 
21,"To-day, however, it was different.  Stephen was a sobered boy.  He had passed through perils and temptations from which, if he had escaped, it had been through no merit of his own.  Things might have been far different.  His life had been saved, so had his peace of mind, and now even the consequences of old transgressions had been lightened for him. What had he done to deserve all this?",day different sober boy pass peril temptation escape merit own thing different life save have peace mind consequence old transgression lighten do deserve 
22,"This was the question which the boy humbly asked himself as he entered the chapel that morning, and the Doctor's sermon fitted well with his altered frame of mind.",question boy ask enter chapel morning sermon fit alter frame mind 
23,"It was a sermon such as he had often heard before in that chapel; the words struck him now with a new force which almost startled him. ""Forgetting those things which are behind--reaching forth unto those things which are before,""--this was the Doctor's text, and in the few simple words in which he urged his hearers to lay the past, with all its burdens, and disappointments, and shame, upon Him in whom alone forgiveness is to be found, Stephen drank in new courage and hope for the future, and in the thankfulness and penitence of his heart resolved to commit his way more honestly than ever to the best of all keeping, compared with which even a brother's love is powerless.",sermon such hear chapel word strike new force startle forgett thing reach thing text few simple word urge hearer lay past burden disappointment shame alone forgiveness find drink new courage hope future thankfulness penitence heart resolve commit way good keeping compare brother love powerless 
24,"Before the morning was over Stephen duly went to the Doctor, who talked to him very seriously.  I need not repeat the talk here.  Stephen was very penitent, and had the good sense to say as little as possible; but when it was all over he thanked the Doctor gratefully, and promised he should never have to talk to him for bad conduct again.",morning go talk repeat talk penitent have good sense say possible thank promise have talk bad conduct 
25,"""You must thank your brother for my not dealing a great deal more severely with the case,"" said Dr Senior; ""and I am quite ready to believe it will not occur again.  Now, good-bye.""",thank brother deal great deal case say ready believe occur good bye 
26,"And off Stephen went, the happiest boy alive, determined more than ever to respect the Doctor's authority, and prove himself a model boy.",go happy boy alive determine more respect authority prove model boy 
27,"Sunday afternoon at Saint Dominic's was usually spent by the boys in fine weather, in strolling about in the gardens, or rambling into the woods by the banks of the Shar.",afternoon spend boy fine weather stroll garden ramble wood bank 
28,"This afternoon, however, was somewhat overcast, and a good many of the boys consequently preferred staying indoors to running the risk of spoiling their best hats in a shower.  Among those who kept the house was Oliver, who, in reply to Wraysford's invitation to go out, pleaded that he was not in the humour.",afternoon overcast good many boy prefer stay run risk spoil good hat shower keep house reply invitation go plead humour 
29,"This indeed was the case, for, now that Stephen's affairs were settled, the dread of the approaching Nightingale examination came back over him like a nightmare, and made him quite miserable.  The nearer the hour of trial came the more convinced did Oliver become that he stood no chance whatever of winning, and with that conviction all the bright hopes of a university course, and the prospects of after-success, seemed extinguished.",case affair settle dread approach examination come nightmare make miserable nearer hour trial come convinced become stand chance win conviction bright hope university course prospect success seem extinguish 
30,"Of course it was very ridiculous of him to worry himself into such a state, but then, reader, he had been working just a little too hard, and it was hardly his fault if he was ridiculous.",course ridiculous worry state reader work little hard fault ridiculous 
31,"Wraysford, though by no means in high spirits, kept his head a good deal better, and tried to enjoy his walk and forget all about books, as if nothing at all was going to happen to-morrow.  As for Loman, he was not visible from morning till night, and a good many guessed, and guessed correctly, that he was at work, even on Sunday.",means high spirit keep head good deal good try enjoy walk forget book go happen visible morning night good many guess guess work 
32,"The small boys, not so much though, I fear, out of reverence for the day as for partisanship of the Fifth, were very indignant on the subject, and held a small full-dress meeting after tea, to protest against one of the candidates taking such an unfair advantage over the others.",small boy fear reverence day partisanship fifth indignant subject hold small full dress meeting tea protest candidate take unfair advantage other 
33,"""He ought to be expelled!"" exclaimed Paul.",expel exclaim 
34,"""All very well,"" said Bramble.  ""Greenfield senior's cramming too, he's been in all the afternoon.""",say senior cramming afternoon 
35,"""He's not cramming, he's got a headache!"" said Stephen.",cramm get headache say

38,"""Shut up, do you hear, or you'll get turned out, Potboy!""",shut hear turn 
39,"This was too much for Stephen, who left the assembly in disgust, after threatening to take an early opportunity on the next day of giving his adversary ""one for himself,"" a threat which we may as well say at once here he did not fail to carry out with his wonted energy.",much leave assembly disgust threaten take early opportunity next day give adversary threat say fail carry wont energy 
40,"The long Sunday ended at last--a Sunday spoiled to many of the boys of Saint Dominic's by distracting thoughts and cares--a day which many impatiently wished over, and which some wished would never give place to the morrow.",long end last spoiled many boy distract thought care day many wish wish give place morrow 
41,"But that morrow came at last, and with it rose Oliver, strengthened and hopeful once more for the trial that lay before him.  He was early at Wraysford's study, whom he found only just out of bed.",come last rise strengthen hopeful more trial lay early study find bed 
42,"""Look alive, old man.  What do you say to a dip in the river before breakfast?  We've got plenty of time, and it will wash off the cobwebs before the exam.""",look alive old man say dip river breakfast get plenty time wash cobweb exam

49,"""Stee,"" said he, addressing his younger brother, who at that moment entered proudly in his new capacity as Wraysford's fag, ""mind you have breakfast ready sharp by eight, do you hear? the best you can get out of Wray's cupboard.  Come along, old boy.""",say address young brother moment enter new capacity fag mind have breakfast ready sharp hear good get cupboard come old boy 
50,"And so they went down to the river, Oliver in unusually good spirits, and Wraysford most unusually depressed and nervous.  The bathe was not a great success, for Wraysford evidently did not enjoy it.",go river good spirit depressed nervous bathe great success enjoy 
51,"""What's wrong, old man?"" said Oliver, as they walked back, ""aren't you well?""",wrong old man say walk 
52,"""I'm all right,"" said Wraysford.",right say 
53,"""But you're out of spirits.  It's odd that I was in dumps and you were in good spirits up to the fatal day, and now things are just reversed. But, I say, you mustn't get down, you know, or it'll tell against you at the exam.""",spirit odd dump good spirit fatal day thing reverse say get know tell exam

61,"""Oh, particularly cheerful, for I've nothing to do all day, I find.  I'm not in for the Nightingale, or for the Mathematical Medal, or for the English Literature.

70,"So, then, all this sympathy and encouragement were not for the two boys at all, but for their Form.  They might just as well have been two carefully trained racehorses starting on a race with heavy odds upon them.",sympathy encouragement boy form train racehorse start race heavy odd 
71,"The Doctor's entry, however, put an end to any further talk, and, as usual, a dead silence ensued after the boys had taken their seats.",entry put end further talk usual dead silence ensue boy take seat 
72,"The Doctor looked a little uneasy.  Doubtless he was impressed, too, by the importance of the occasion.  He proceeded to call over the lists of candidates for the different examinations in a fidgety manner, very unlike his usual self, and then turning abruptly to the class, said:",look little uneasy impressed importance occasion proceed call list candidate different examination fidgety manner usual self turn class say

I had been engaged in getting together the various papers of questions for to-day's examinations, and left them lying on the corner of the table.  On returning to my study--I had not been absent five minutes--I found that one of the papers--one of the Nightingale Scholarship papers, which I had only just copied out, was missing.  If I were not perfectly sure the full number was there before I left the room, I should conclude I was mistaken, but of that I am sure.  I just wish to ask this one question here, which I have already asked in the Sixth.

You know what it is to dash nervously from question to question, answering a bit of this and a bit of that, but lacking the patience to work steadily down the list. And you have experienced doubtless the aggravation of hearing the pen of the man on your right flying along the paper with a hideous squeak, never stopping for a moment to give you a chance.  And knowing all this, there is no need for me to describe the vicissitudes of this particular day of ordeal at Saint Dominic's.",reader know horror examination room know sit bite end pen glaring ruthless question front know dash question question answer bit bit lack patience work list experience aggravation hear pen man right fly paper hideous squeak stop moment give chance know be need describe vicissitude particular day ordeal

94,"Loman was one of them.  He was evidently in difficulties, and the Fifth Form fellows, who looked round occasionally from their English Literature papers, were elated to see their own men writing steadily and hard, while the Sixth man looked all aground.  There was one boy, however, who had no time for such observations.  That was Simon.  He had got hold of a question which was after his own heart, and demanded every second of his attention--""Describe, in not more than twelve lines of blank verse, the natural beauties of the River Shar.""
