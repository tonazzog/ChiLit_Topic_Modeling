2,"Now among those who were present to witness the famous ""rush-up"" of Greenfield senior and Wraysford, which ended in the fall of the County goal, was one boy who showed very little enthusiasm over the achievement, or very little delight at the glory which the school thereby derived.",present witness famous rush up senior end fall goal boy show little enthusiasm achievement little delight glory school derive 
3,"Loman, who, unable to sit in his study, and not knowing what else to do, had wandered almost instinctively to the meadow, found himself on this particular afternoon one of the most miserable boys in Saint Dominic's.",unable sit study know else do wander meadow find particular afternoon miserable boy 
4,"Two years ago, when he first entered the school, he was popular with his fellows and voted an acquisition on the cricket-ground and football-field whenever the youth of Saint Dominic's strove in emulation against their rivals.  He could remember a time when fellows strolled arm-in-arm with him down to the matches; when the small boys looked quite meek in his presence, and the masters gave a friendly nod in answer to his salutes.  That was when he was quite new at Saint Dominic's; but how changed now!  This afternoon, for instance, as he stood looking on, he had the cheerful knowledge that not a boy in all that assembly cared two straws about him.  Why wasn't _he_ playing in the match?  Why did the fellows, as they came near him, look straight in front of them, or go round to avoid him?  Why did the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles strut about and crack their vulgar jokes right under his very nose, as if he was nobody?  Alas, Loman! something's been wrong with you for the last year or thereabouts; and if we don't all know the cause, we can see the effect.  For it is a fact, you _are_ nobody in the eyes of Saint Dominic's at the present time.",year enter school popular fellow vote acquisition cricket ground football field youth strive emulation rival remember time fellow stroll arm arm match small boy look meek presence master give friendly nod answer salute new change afternoon instance stand look have cheerful knowledge boy assembly care straw _he_ play match fellow come look front go avoid guinea pig tadpole strut crack vulgar joke very nose wrong last year know cause see effect fact eye present time 
5,"However, he was destined to become a somebody pretty soon; and, indeed, as soon as the football match was over, and the supper after it was disposed of, and the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles (who, you know, had selected this same afternoon _for their_ great football match) had ceased their rows in slumber, every one's mind, at least the mind of every one in the two head forms, turned naturally to the strange and mysterious event of the morning.  What various conclusions they came to it is not for me to set down here.  They probably came to as good a conclusion as the reader has done, and waited impatiently to have the whole thing cleared up.",destine become football match supper dispose guinea pig tadpole know select same afternoon their_ great football match cease row slumber one mind least mind one head form turn strange mysterious event morning various conclusion come set come good conclusion reader do wait have whole thing clear 
6,"And it looked as if the Doctor were about to do this next morning, for he summoned together the Fifth and Sixth, and thus solemnly addressed them:--",look about do next morning summon fifth address 
7,"""Before we begin the lesson for the day, boys, I wish to refer to an incident that happened here yesterday morning, which must be fresh in your memories.  I mean the accidental discovery of the lost examination paper for the Nightingale Scholarship.  I hope you will not draw hasty conclusions from what then occurred.  The boy in whose book the paper was found is present here, and has assured me on his honour he never saw the paper before, and is quite ignorant how it came into his book.

11,"""But,"" went on the Doctor, turning again to the boys, ""before I dismiss the subject I must do justice to one among you who I find, much to my pain, has been an object of suspicion in connection with this same lost paper.  Greenfield senior, I have no hesitation in saying, is perfectly clear of any such imputation as that you put upon him.  I may say in his presence I believe him to be incapable of a fraudulent and mean act; and further than that, you boys will be interested to hear that the questions which he answered so brilliantly in that examination were not the questions which appeared on the lost paper at all, but an entirely new set, which for my own satisfaction I drew up on the morning of examination itself.""",go turn boy dismiss subject do justice find much pain object suspicion connection same lose paper senior have hesitation say clear such imputation put say presence believe incapable fraudulent mean act boy interested hear question answer examination question appear lose paper new set own satisfaction draw morning examination

13,"It interested Oliver and Wraysford as much as any one, but for a different reason.  Supposing Loman had taken the paper--this was the reflection which darted through both their minds--supposing Loman _had_ taken the paper and worked up the answers from it, might not the sudden change of questions described by the Doctor account for the low place he had taken in the exam?",interest much one different reason suppose take paper reflection dart mind suppose take paper work answer sudden change question describe account low place take exam 
14,"Altogether the Doctor's speech left things (except as concerned Oliver) not much more satisfactory than before.  The natural impulse of everybody was to suspect Loman.  But, then, six months ago the natural impulse had been equally as strong to suspect Oliver, and--well, that had somehow turned out a bad ""spec,"" and so might this.",speech leave thing concern satisfactory natural impulse suspect month natural impulse strong suspect turn bad spec 
15,"So Saint Dominic's really didn't know what to think, and settled down to the work of the term in an uneasy frame of mind, wishing something would turn up, to end the wretched affair of the lost paper definitely one way or another.",know think settle work term uneasy frame mind wish turn end wretched affair lose paper way

17,"They turned out in a body and hooted Loman up and down the passages with as much, if not more, glee than some of them had lately hooted Oliver. ""Yah, boo!  Who stole the exam paper?--there! old Loman.""  Such were the cries which presently became familiar in the school, until one day Mr Rastle dropped down on some twenty of the ""howlers,"" and set them each twelve propositions of Euclid to learn by heart, and two hours a-piece in the detention-room, there to meditate over their evil ways.",turn body hoot passage much more glee hoot steal exam paper old such cry become familiar school day drop howler set proposition learn heart hour piece detention room meditate evil way 
18,The quiet of the lower school during the next week was something delicious.,quiet low school next week delicious 
19,"The tyrannical proceeding on the part of Mr Rastle provoked bitter indignation, of course, in the breasts of the culprits.  Why weren't they to be allowed to express their feelings?  And if Rastle did want to ""pot"" them, why should he give them Euclid to learn, when he knew perfectly well Euclid was the very thing not one of them _could_ learn by heart?  And if he did want to detain them, why _ever_ should he fix on the identical week in which the grand ""Vocal, Instrumental, and Dramatic Entertainment"" of the Fourth Junior was due to come off.",tyrannical proceeding part provoke bitter indignation course breast culprit allow express feeling want pot give learn know very thing _could_ learn heart want detain fix identical week grand vocal instrumental dramatic fourth due come 
20,"It was an abominable piece of spite, that was a fact; and Mr Rastle was solemnly condemned one evening in the dormitory to be blown up with dynamite at the first convenient opportunity.  Meanwhile, come what would, the ""Vocal, Instrumental, and Dramatic Entertainment"" _should_ come off, if it cost every man Jack of the ""entertainers"" his head.",abominable piece spite fact condemn evening dormitory blow dynamite first convenient opportunity come vocal instrumental dramatic _should_ come cost man entertainer head 
21,"Stephen, who by this time was a person of authority in his class, was appointed president of the ""V. I. and D. Society.""  The manner of his election to this honourable office had been peculiar, but emphatic.  He had been proposed by Paul and seconded by himself in a short but elegant speech, in which he asserted he would only serve if his appointment was unanimous.  It _was_ unanimous, for directly after this magnanimous statement he and Paul and a few others proceeded summarily to eject Bramble, Padger, and others who showed signs of opposition; and then, locking the door, proceeded to an immediate vote, which, amid loud Guinea-pig cheers, was declared to be unanimous, one contumacious Tadpole, who had escaped notice, having his hands held down by his sides during the ceremony.  As soon as the doors were open, Bramble, who had meanwhile collected a large muster of adherents, rushed in, and, turning out all the Guinea-pigs, had himself elected treasurer, and Padger honorary secretary.  These exciting appointments having been made, the meeting was ""thrown open,"" a programme was drawn up, and the preparations were in a very forward state when the sad interruption occasioned by Mr Rastle's brutal conduct took place.  But if Mr Rastle thought he was going to extinguish the ""Vocal, Instrumental, and Dramatic Entertainment"" he was woefully mistaken.",time person authority class appoint president manner election honourable office peculiar emphatic propose second short elegant speech assert serve appointment unanimous unanimous magnanimous statement few other proceed eject other show sign opposition lock door proceed immediate vote loud guinea pig cheer declare unanimous contumacious escape notice have hand hold side ceremony door open collect large muster adherent rush turn guinea pig have elect treasurer honorary secretary exciting appointment make meeting throw open programme draw preparation forward state sad interruption occasion brutal conduct take place think go extinguish vocal instrumental dramatic mistaken

32,"It was some time before the meeting got back to the subject of admitting the public.  But it was finally agreed that, though the public were not to be invited, the door should be left open, and any one (""presenting his card,"" young Bilbury suggested) might come in, with the exception of Loman, Mr Rastle, Tom Braddy, and the school cat.",time meeting get subject admit public agree public invite door leave open one present card young suggest come exception school cat 
33,"For the next few days the Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were busy, learning their parts, practising their songs, arranging all the details of their dramatic performance, and so on; and Mr Rastle had to ""pot"" one or two more of them, and detain one or two others, before he could get anything like the ordinary work of the class done.  All this the young vocal, instrumental, and dramatic enthusiasts bore patiently, devoting so many extra ounces of dynamite to Mr Rastle's promised blow-up for each offence.",next few day guinea pig tadpole busy learn part practise song arrange detail dramatic performance have pot more detain other get ordinary work class do young vocal instrumental dramatic enthusiast bear devote many extra ounce dynamite promise blow offence

55,"At seven that evening, after tea, the Fourth Junior room became a centre of attraction to all Saint Dominic's.

56,"The programme had been carefully got up.  Stephen took the chair solemnly at the appointed hour, and with a great deal of stammering announced that the proceedings were now about to commence, and then sat down.  An awful pause ensued.  At first it was borne with interest, then with impatience; then, when Stephen began to whisper to Paul, and Paul began to signal to Bramble, and Bramble gesticulated in dumb show at Padger, and all four whispered together, and finally looked very gravely in an opposite direction to the audience, then they began to be amused.",programme get take chair appoint hour great deal stammering announce proceedings about commence sit awful pause ensue first borne interest impatience begin whisper begin signal gesticulate dumb show whisper look opposite direction audience begin amuse

67,"He retired at length in dudgeon, and Stephen called on Paul for a song. This went off better, only everybody stamped the time with his feet, so that the singer could neither be heard for the row nor seen for the dust.  After that followed another ""reading.""  This time the subject was a humorous one--""Ben Battle,"" by T. Hood.  Every one, by the way, chose Hood.  It was the only poetry-book to be had in the Fourth Junior.  The reading progressed satisfactorily for the first two lines--indeed, until a joke occurred, and here the reader was so overcome with the humour of the thing that he broke into a laugh, and every time he tried to begin the next line he laughed before he could get it out, until at last it got to be quite as monotonous as watching the hyena at the Zoological Gardens.  Finally he did get through the line, but in a voice so weak, wavering by reason of his efforts not to laugh, that the effect was more ludicrous than ever.  He could get no farther, however.  For the recollection of the joke that had passed, and the anticipation of the one that was coming, fairly doubled him up, and he let the book drop out of his hands in the middle of one of his convulsions.",retire length dudgeon call song go good stamp time foot singer hear row see dust follow reading time subject humorous one one way choose only poetry book have fourth reading progress first line joke occur reader overcome humour thing break laugh time try begin next line laugh get last get monotonous watch hyena zoological get line voice weak waver reason effort laugh effect ludicrous get far recollection joke pass anticipation one come double let book drop hand middle convulsion 
68,"The next performance was an ""instrumental"" one, which bade fair to be a great success.  Four of the boys had learned to whistle ""Home, Sweet Home"" in parts, and were now about to ravish the audience with this time-honoured melody.  They stood meekly side by side in a straight line facing the audience, waiting for the leader to begin, and screwing their mouths up into the proper shape.  Just as the signal was given, and each had taken a long breath and was in the act of letting out, some lout in the audience laughed!  The result may be imagined.  The first note, which was to have been so beautiful, sounded just like the letting off of steam from four leaky safety-valves, and no effort could recover the melody.  The more they tried the more they laughed.  The more they laughed the more the audience roared.  There they stood, with faces of mingled agony and mirth, frantically trying to get the sound out; but it never came, and they finally had to retire, leaving the audience to imagine what the effect of ""Home, Sweet Home"" might have been had they only got at it.",next performance instrumental one bid fair great success boy learn whistle sweet part about ravish audience time honoure melody stand side side straight line face audience wait leader begin screw mouth proper shape signal give take long breath act let lout audience laugh result imagine first note beautiful sound let steam leaky safety valve effort recover melody more try more laugh more laugh audience roar stand face mingle agony mirth try get sound come have retire leave audience imagine effect sweet get
