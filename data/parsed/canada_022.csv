1,CHAPTER XXII.,
2," When we left off our narrative, our Canadian settlers were enjoying themselves on Christmas day. On the following morning, Malachi Bone, the Strawberry, and John, set off for their abode to the westward, and Captain Sinclair and his companion went back to the fort. The Indian woman was better, and the family resumed their usual occupations. We must now briefly narrate a few events which occurred during the remainder of the long winter. Malachi and John made their appearance, accompanied by the Strawberry, almost every Sunday, and the old hunter appeared gradually to become more reconciled to the society of others, and sometimes would remain for a day or two over the Sunday. The Indian woman, in the course of three weeks, was quite recovered, and signified, through the Strawberry, her wish to leave, and join her tribe. To this, of course, no objection was raised; and having received a supply of provisions, she took her leave at the latter end of the month of January.",leave narrative canadian settler enjoy day follow morning set abode westward companion go fort indian woman good family resume usual occupation narrate few event occur remainder long winter make appearance accompany old hunter appear become reconcile society other remain day indian woman course week recover signify wish leave join tribe course objection raise receive supply provision take leave latter end month 
3,"February,--March followed, and the winter still continued, but the sun became more powerful, and the weather was not so severe. It was not till the middle of April that the lake was clear of ice and the thaw commenced, and then it was so rapid, that the little stream became quite an impetuous torrent, and a large portion of the prairie land was under water. A few days, however, sufficed to change the scene; the snow, which had covered the ground for so many months, had all disappeared; the birds, which had been mute or had migrated during the winter, now made their appearance, and chirped and twittered round the house; the pleasant green of the prairie was once more presented to their view, and nature began to smile again. Other ten days passed, and the trees had thrown out their leaves, and after one or two storms, the weather became warm and the sky serene.",follow winter continue sun become powerful weather severe middle lake clear ice thaw commence rapid little stream become impetuous torrent large portion prairie land water few day suffice change scene snow cover ground many month disappear bird mute migrate winter make appearance chirp twitter house pleasant green prairie present view nature begin smile other day pass tree throw leave storm weather become warm sky serene 
4,"Great was the delight of the whole party at this change; and now the cows were put out to their pasture, and Emma and Mary went milking as before, no longer afraid of meeting with the wolves. The boat was launched, and Percival and John went out to procure fish. Alfred, Henry, and Martin were very busy picking up the cleared ground, to sow the first crop. Mr. Campbell worked all day in the garden; the poultry were noisy and bustling, and soon furnished an abundant supply of eggs; and as now the hunting season was over for a time, Malachi and the Strawberry were continually coming to visit them.",great delight whole party change cow put pasture go milk afraid meet wolf boat launch go procure fish busy pick clear ground sow first crop work day garden poultry noisy bustling furnish abundant supply egg hunting season time come visit 
5,"""Oh! how delightful this is,"" exclaimed Emma, as she stopped at the bridge and looked on the wide blue lake; ""is it not, Mary, after having been cooped up for so many weary months?""",delightful exclaim stop bridge look wide blue lake coop many weary month 
6,"""It is, indeed, Emma; I do not wonder at your flow of spirits; I feel quite another person myself. Well, if the winter is long and dreary, at all events, it doubly enhances the value of the spring.""",wonder flow spirit feel person winter long dreary event enhance value spring 
7,"""I think it very odd that Captain Sinclair has not come to see us; don't you, Mary?""",think odd come see 
8,"""I certainly did expect him before this,"" replied Mary; ""I presume, however, his duty will not permit him to come.""",expect reply presume duty permit come 
9,"""Surely he could get leave, now that the weather is fine; there was some reason for his not coming during the winter. I hope he is not ill.""",get leave weather fine be reason come winter hope ill 
10,"""I hope so too, most sincerely, Emma,"" replied Mary; ""but come, sister, we must not loiter; hear how the calves are bleating for us to let them have their breakfast; we shall have more of them very soon; yes, and plenty of milk, and then we shall have plenty of churning; but I like work when the weather is fine.""",hope reply come sister loiter hear calve bleat let have breakfast have more plenty milk have plenty churning like work weather fine 
11,"After breakfast, Emma expressed her surprise to Alfred at Captain Sinclair's not having made his appearance, and her fear that he was not well. Alfred, at her request, promised to walk to the fort in the afternoon, and ascertain how matters were.",breakfast express surprise make appearance fear request promise walk fort afternoon ascertain matter 
12,"John, who had not forgotten the advice of Malachi, brought in a basket of fine trout from the stream almost every day, and the supply of fish and eggs proved very acceptable, for the beef had all been consumed, and the family would otherwise have been reduced to salt-pork.",forget advice bring basket fine trout stream day supply fish egg prove acceptable beef consume family reduce salt pork 
13,"Alfred, as he had promised Emma, set off for the fort, accompanied by Martin. He returned the next morning, full of news. Captain Sinclair was, as Emma had imagined, unable to come, having had a severe fall, by which he had injured his knee, and was laid up for a time; he was, however, in very good spirits, and the medical officer had promised that he should be well again in a fortnight; he sent his kind regards to all the family. The commandant also sent his compliments to Mr. Campbell, and desired to acquaint him that, in a week or ten days, it was his intention to send a boat to Montreal, and if Mr. Campbell had any purchases to make, or wished to send any one by the opportunity, he might do so, and the boat would bring back the articles he required. They had no further communication with Quebec, but expected a runner to come every day with the letters from England and newspapers; and further, that he hoped soon to be able to pay his respects in person.",promise set fort accompany return next morning full news imagine unable come have severe fall injure knee lay time good spirit medical officer promise fortnight send kind regards family commandant send compliment desire acquaint week day intention send boat have purchase make wish send one opportunity do boat bring article require have further communication expect runner come day letter newspaper hope able pay respect person 
14,"Such was the information brought by Alfred; Emma made many inquiries relative to Captain Sinclair as Mary stood by, and Alfred laughed at her extreme inquisitiveness. The proposition of the commandant relative to the trip to Montreal was then discussed. Old Malachi had several packages of furs to dispose of. Martin had five, Alfred three, and Henry two; for, although we made no mention of it, on their hunting excursions, whoever killed the animal, was entitled to the skin. The packages of Malachi were, however, of some value, as he had many beaver and other skins, while those of Martin and the others consisted chiefly of deer-skins. The question was, whom to send down with them. Malachi was not inclined to go, Martin could not well be spared, and, moreover, would very probably get into some scrape if he went to Montreal; whereas Henry and Alfred did not know any thing about the value of skins; otherwise, Mr. Campbell, who wished to purchase flour and pork, besides several other articles, would have preferred sending one of them. But the difficulty was soon removed by old Malachi, who observed, that he had made a valuation of his skins, and that the others could be valued also before they were packed up; and that if not sold for what they ought to fetch, or nearly so, they had better be brought back. Mr. Campbell was satisfied with this arrangement, and Henry was appointed to undertake the journey. Mr. Campbell made out his inventory of articles; Mrs. Campbell added her list, and all was ready as soon as they received notice that the boat was to leave. Martin did not appear at all annoyed at not being selected for the expedition; since Malachi Bone had informed them that the Strawberry was not his wife, as they had supposed, Martin was continually by her side. She began to speak a few words of English, and had become a great favorite with every body.",such information bring make many inquiry relative stand laugh extreme inquisitiveness proposition commandant relative trip discuss old have several package fur dispose have make mention hunting excursion kill animal entitle skin package value have many beaver other skin other consist deer skin question send inclined go spare get scrape go know thing value skin wish purchase flour pork several other article prefer send difficulty remove old observe make valuation skin other value pack sell fetch bring satisfied arrangement appoint undertake journey make inventory article add list ready receive notice boat leave appear annoy select expedition inform wife suppose side begin speak few word become great favorite body 
15,"Mr. Campbell, as soon as he perceived that Malachi no longer avoided them, thought it but his duty to offer him his land back again, but Malachi would not consent to accept it. He said he did not want the land, although perhaps, he might raise his lodge a little nearer to them than it was; at present, things had better remain as they were; after which Mr. Campbell did not renew the subject. Malachi soon acted upon his remark, that perhaps he might raise his lodge a little nearer, for, a few days afterward, he made his appearance with the Strawberry and John, all three loaded with his household utensils, and in a very short time he had erected another wigwam within sight of the house at the western end of Mr. Campbell's prairie. This gave great satisfaction to Mrs. Campbell, because John was now always near them; indeed, he no longer slept in the lodge, but at the house, in the room with his brothers. The major part of the day he passed at the lodge, or in company with the old hunter; but, by this new arrangement, they gradually became, as it were, one family; not a day passed that the Strawberry did not come to their house and make herself useful, assisting in every thing that she could, and rapidly learning what she did not know.",perceive avoid think duty offer land consent accept say want land raise lodge little nearer present thing remain renew subject act remark raise lodge little nearer few day make appearance load household utensil short time erect wigwam sight house western end prairie give great satisfaction sleep lodge house room brother major part day pass lodge company old hunter new arrangement become family day pass come house make useful assist thing learn know 
16,"One or two evenings after the message from the fort, Mrs. Campbell asked Malachi some questions relative to the habits of the beaver, as she had heard much of the sagacity of that animal.",evening message fort ask question relative habit beaver hear much sagacity animal 
17,"""Well, ma'am,"" said Malachi, ""it's a most reasonable animal, certainly, and I will say, I never was tired with watching them; I've even forgot, in the summer-time, what I came out for, from having fallen in with them at work.""",say reasonable animal say tired watch forget summer time come fall work 
18,"""And so have I,"" said Martin. ""I once was lying down under a bush by the side of a stream, and I saw a whole council of them meet together, and they talked after their own fashion so earnestly, and I really think they have a language as good as our own. It's always the old ones who talk, and the young ones who listen.""",say lie bush side stream see whole council meet talk own fashion think have language good own old one talk young one listen 
19,"""That's true,"" replied Malachi. ""I once myself saw them hold a council, and then they all separated to go to work, for they were about to dam up a stream and build their lodges.""",true reply see hold council separate go work about do stream build lodge 
20,"""And what did they do, Malachi?"" said Mrs. Campbell.",do say 
21,"""Why, ma'am, they did all the same as Christians would have done. The Injuns say that beavers have souls as well as themselves, and certainly, if sense gave souls, the Injuns would be in the right. The first thing that they did was to appoint their sentinels to give notice of danger; for the moment any one comes near them, these sentinels give the signal and away they all dive, and disappear till the danger is over.""",do same do say beaver have soul sense give soul right first thing do appoint sentinel give notice danger moment one come sentinel give signal dive disappear danger 
22,"""There are many beasts as well as birds that do the same,"" observed Mr. Campbell; ""indeed, most of those which are gregarious and live in flocks.""",be many beast bird do same observe most gregarious live flock 
23,"""That's true, sir,"" replied Martin.",true sir reply 
24,"""Well, ma'am, the beavers choose a place fit for their work. What they require is a stream running through a flat or bottom, which stream of water they may dam up so as to form a large pond of a sufficient depth by the water flowing over and covering the flat or bottom several feet; and when they have found the spot they require, they begin their work.""",beaver choose place fit work require stream run flat bottom stream water do form large pond sufficient depth water flow cover flat bottom several foot find spot require begin work 
25,"""Perhaps,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""this choice requires more sagacity than the rest of their labor, for the beavers must have some engineering talent to make the selection. They must be able to calculate as exactly as if they took their levels, to secure the size and depth of water in the pond which is necessary. It is the most wonderful, perhaps, of all the instincts, or reasoning powers rather, allotted to them.""",observe choice require more sagacity rest labor beaver have engineering talent make selection able calculate take level secure size depth water pond necessary wonderful instinct reasoning power allot 
26,"""It is, sir; and I've often thought so,"" replied Malachi; ""and then to see how they carry all their tools about them; a carpenter's basket could not be better provided. Their strong teeth serve as axes to cut down the trees; then their tails serve as trowels for their mason's work; their fore-feet they use just as we do our hands, and their tails are also employed as little carts or wheelbarrows.""",sir think reply see carry tool carpenter basket provide strong tooth serve axe cut tree tail serve trowel mason work fore foot use do hand tail employ little cart wheelbarroww 
27,"""Pray go on, Malachi,"" said Mary; ""I am quite interested already.""",pray go say interested 
28,"""Well, miss, I have known these little creatures as they are, raise banks four or five hundred paces in length, and a matter of twenty feet high in some parts, besides being seven or eight feet thick; and all in one season,--perhaps five or six months' work.""",miss know little creature raise bank pace length matter foot high part foot thick season month work 
29,"""But how many of them do you reckon are at the work?"" said Henry.",many reckon work say 
30,"""Perhaps a hundred; not more, I should say.""",more say 
31,"""Well; but how do they raise these banks, Malachi?"" said Emma.",raise bank say 
32,"""There, miss, they show what sense they have. I've often watched them when they have been sawing through the large trees with the front teeth; they could not carry the tree, that's sartin, if the whole of them were to set to work, so they always pick out the trees by the banks of the stream, and they examine how the trees incline, to see if they will fall into the stream; if not, they will not cut them down; and when they are cutting them down, and they are nearly ready for falling, if the wind should change and be against the fall, they will leave that tree till the wind will assist them. As soon as the trees are down, they saw off the branches and arms, and float the log down to where the dam is to be made; they lay them across, and as they lay them one upon the other, of course the water rises and enables them to float down and place the upper ones. But before that, as soon as the lower logs are in their places, the animals go and fetch long grass and clay, which they load upon their flat tails, and drag to the dam, filling up the holes between the timber till it is as strong as a wall, and the water is completely stopped.""",miss show sense have watch saw large tree front tooth carry tree sartin whole set work pick tree bank stream examine tree incline see fall stream cut cut ready fall wind change fall leave tree wind assist tree see branch arm float log dam make lay lay other course water rise enable float place upper one low log place animal go fetch long grass clay load flat tail drag dam fill hole timber strong wall water stop 
33,"""Yes,"" said Martin; ""I have heard them at night working away so hard and flapping and spattering with their tails, that I could imagine there were fifty men at work instead of a hundred of these small animals, but they work by day and by night, and never seem tired, till the dam is sound and their work is complete.""",say hear night work flap spattering tail imagine be man work small animal work day night seem tired dam sound work complete 
34,"""But the raising of the dam is only preparatory, is it not, to their building their own houses?"" observed Mrs. Campbell.",raising dam preparatory build own house observe 
35,"""Nothing more, ma'am; and I think the rest of the work is quite as wonderful.""",more think rest work wonderful 
36,"""But it is time to go to bed,"" observed Mr. Campbell, ""and we must, therefore, leave the remainder of Malachi's story till another evening.""",time go bed observe leave remainder story evening 
37,"""I am sure that there is not one of the party who is more anxious to hear it than I am,"" replied Mrs. Campbell, rising, ""but as you say, it is past ten o'clock, and Malachi and the Strawberry have to go home, so good-night.""",sure be party anxious hear reply rise say past o'clock have go good night 
38,"""Oh, dear! what a pity!"" cried Percival, ""I shall dream of beavers all night, I'm sure I shall.""",dear pity cry dream beaver night sure
