1,CHAPTER XXII.,
2," When at last day streamed in silver across the peaks, the storm had spent itself. But Nod did not stir, nor draw near to the fire to drink of the hot pepper-water the travellers had brewed against the cold. Thumb came at last and stooped over him. ""Get up now, Ummanodda, little brother, and do not mope and sulk any more. I was angry because I was afraid. How should we have gone a day in safety without the Nizza-neela and his Wonderstone? Come nearer to the fire, and dry your sodden sheep's-coat.""",last day stream silver peak storm spend stir draw fire drink hot pepper water traveller brew cold thumb come last stoop get little brother mope sulk more angry afraid go day safety come fire dry sodden sheep coat 
3,"Nod crept forlornly to the fire, and sat there shivering. He could not eat. He crouched low on his heels, nor paid any heed to what was said or done around him. And presently he fell into a cold, uneasy sleep, full of dreadful dreams and voices. When he awoke, he peered sullenly out of his jacket, and saw Ghibba with three of the five Moona-mulgars that he had taken with him sitting hunched up round the fire. They had come back bruised and bedraggled, and torn with thorns. One of them, stumbling in the gloom on the green rocks, had fallen headlong into the cataract, and had not been seen again; and one had been pounced on and carried off by some unknown beast while they were hobbling back in the torchless darkness towards the beacon above the cataract. There was no way beyond the ravine. All was dense low forest, rocks and thorns, and pouring waterways. And the travellers knew not what to be doing.",nod creep fire sit shiver eat crouch heel pay heed say do fall cold uneasy sleep full dreadful dream voice awoke peer jacket see mulgar take sit hunch fire come bruise bedraggle tear thorn stumble gloom green rock fall cataract see pounce carry unknown beast hobble torchless darkness beacon cataract be way ravine dense low forest rock thorn pour waterway traveller know do 
4,"Nod could not bear to look at them nor listen to their lisping, mournful voices. He covered up his face again, weary of the journey and of the dream of Tishnar's Valleys, weary of his brothers, of the very daylight, but weariest of himself.",nod bear look listen lisping mournful voice cover face weary journey dream weary brother very daylight weariest 
5,"After long palaver, Ghibba came shuffling over to him, and sat down beside him.",long palaver come shuffle sit 
6,"""Is the Mulla-mulgar ill, that he sits alone, hiding his eyes?"" he said.",mulgar ill sit hide eye say 
7,"Nod shook his head. ""I am in my second sleep, Mountain-mulgar. A little frost has cankered my bones. It is the Harp Nod hears, not Zevvera's zōōts.""",shake head second sleep mulgar little frost canker bone hear zōōt 
8,"Ghibba sat with a very solemn look on his grey scarred face. ""The Mulla-mulgars say there can be no turning back, Nizza-neela. And, by the way I have come, it is certain that there is no going onward. Then, say they, being Mulgars-of-a-race, we must float with the mountain-water into the great cavern, and trust our hearts to the fishes. Maybe it will carry us to where every shadow comes at last; maybe these are the waters of the Fountains of Assasimmon.""",sit solemn look grey scarr face mulgar say be turning way come certain be go say race float mountain water great cavern trust heart fish carry shadow come last water 
9,"""I see no boat,"" yapped Nod scornfully. ""The only boat my brothers ever floated in was an old Gunga's Oomgar-nugga's bobberie that now is a nest in Obea-Munza for Coccadrilloes' eggs.""",see boat yapp only boat brother float old bobberie nest egg 
10,"""Already my people are gathering branches,"" said Ghibba, ""to make floating mats or rafts, such as I saw one of the Fishing-mulgars squatting on while he dangled his tail for fish-bait. Comfort your weary bones, then, Eengenares. Tishnar, who guards you, Tishnar, whose Prince you are, Tishnar, who feasted even Utts like me on fruits of sleeping-time, will not forsake us now.""",person gather branch say make float mat raft such see mulgar squat dangle tail fish bait comfort weary bone guard feast fruit sleeping time forsake 
11,"Nod turned cold, and trembling, as if to tell this solemn Man of the Mountains that his Wonderstone was gone. But he swallowed his spittle, and was ashamed. So he rose up and listlessly hobbled after him to where the rest of the travellers were toiling to gather branches for their rafts.",nod turn cold tremble tell solemn gone swallow spittle ashamed rise hobble rest traveller toil gather branch raft 
12,"The storm had snapped and stripped off many branches from the trees. These the travellers dragged down to the water. Others they hauled down with Cullum ropes, and some smaller saplings they charred through with fire at the root. When they had heaped together a big pile of boughs and Samarak, Cullum and all kinds of greenery, Ghibba and Thumb bound them clumsily one by one together, letting them float out on to the water, until the raft was large and buoyant enough to bear two or three Mulgars with their bags. For one great raft that would have carried them all in safety would have been too unwieldy to enter the mouth of the cavern, besides being harder for these ignorant sailors to navigate. The torrent flowed swiftly into the cavern. And if but two or three sailed in together, Fortune might drown or lose many in the dark windings of the mountain-water, but one or two at least might escape.",storm snap stripp many branch tree traveller drag water other haul rope small sapling char fire root heap big pile bough kind greenery bind let float water raft large buoyant bear bag great raft carry safety unwieldy enter mouth cavern hard ignorant sailor navigate torrent flow cavern sail drown lose many dark winding mountain water least escape 
13,"They toiled on till evening, by which time four strong green rafts bobbed side by side at their mooring-ropes on the water. Then, tired out, sore and blistered with their day's labours, the travellers heaped up a great watch-fire once more, and supped merrily together, since it might be for many of them for the last time. Nor did the mountain-mulgars raise their drone for their kinsfolk beneath the cataract, wishing to keep a brave heart for the dangers before them.",toil evening time strong green raft bobb side side mooring rope water tired sore blister day labour traveller heap great watch fire more supp many last time mountain mulgar raise drone kinsfolk cataract wish keep brave heart danger 
14,"Only Nod sat gloomy and downcast, waiting impatiently till all should be lying fast asleep. One by one the outwearied travellers laid themselves down, with the palms of their feet towards the fire. Nod heard the calling of the beasts in the ravine, and ever and again from far up the mountain-side broke out the long hungry howl of the little wolves. Only Nod and the Mountain-mulgar whose turn it was to keep watch were now awake. He was a queer old Mulgar, blind of one eye, but he could stand wide awake for hours mumbling in his mouth a shaving of their blue cheese-rind. And when he had turned his back for a moment on the fire, Nod wriggled softly away, and, hobbling off into the forest, soon reached the water-side.",sit gloomy downcast wait lie asleep outwearied traveller lay palm foot fire nod hear calling beast ravine mountain side break long hungry howl little wolf mulgar turn keep watch awake queer old blind eye stand hour mumble mouth shaving blue cheese rind turn back moment fire wriggle hobble forest reach water side 
15,"He crept forward under the gigantic dragon-tree, and down the steep bank to the little creek where he had first heard the singing of the Water-midden. All was shadowy and still. Only the dark water murmured in its stony channel, and the faint night-wind rustled in the sedge. Nod leaned on his belly over the water, and, gazing into it, called as softly and clearly as his harsh voice could: ""Water-midden, Water-midden, here am I, Ummanodda, come as you bade me.""",creep gigantic dragon tree steep bank little creek hear singing midden shadowy dark water murmure stony channel faint night wind rustle sedge nod learn belly water gaze call harsh voice water midden water midden come bid 
16,"No one answered. He stooped lower, and called again. ""It is me, the Mulla-mulgar, child of Tishnar, who trusted to you his Wonderstone, beautiful Midden. Nod, who believed in you, calls--your friend, the sorrowful Nod!""",answer stoop low call mulgar child trust beautiful believe call friend sorrowful nod 
17,"""Sing, Mulla-mulgar!"" croaked a scornful sedge-bird. ""The Princess loves sweet music.""",sing croak scornful sedge bird love sweet music 
18,A lean fish of the changing colours of a cherry swam softly to the glimmering surface and stared at Nod.,lean fish change colour cherry swim glimmer surface stare 
19,"""Tell me, Jacket-of-Loveliness,"" whispered Nod, ""where is thy mistress that she does not answer me?""",tell whisper mistress answer 
20,The fish stared solemnly on wavering fin.,fish stare waver fin 
21,"""Hsst, brother,"" said Nod, and let fall a bunch of Soota-berries into the stream. The fish leapt in the water, and caught the little fruit in its thin, curved teeth, and nibbled greedily till all was gone. Whereupon, staring solemnly at Nod once more, he let the leaves and stalk float onward with the stream, then with a flash and flicker of tail dived down, down, and was gone. All again was silent. Only the blazing stars and the shadowy phantoms of the distant firelight moved on the water.",brother say let fall bunch berries stream fish leapt water catch little fruit thin curved tooth nibble gone stare let leave stalk float stream flash flicker tail dive gone silent blaze star shadowy phantom distant firelight move water 
22,"""O Tishnar,"" muttered the little Mulgar to himself, ""help once this wretched Nod!""",mutter little help wretch nod 
23,"Suddenly, as he watched, as if it were the amber or ivory beam of a lantern in the water, he saw a pale brightness ascending. And all in a moment the Water-midden was there rocking on the dark green water beneath the arching sedge. But her hands, when Nod looked to see, were empty, floating like rose-leaves open on the water. But he spoke gently, for he could not look into her beautiful wild face, and her eyes, that were like the forest for darkness and the moonlit mountains of Tishnar for loveliness, and still be angry, nor even sad.",watch amber ivory beam lantern water see pale brightness ascend moment midden rock dark green water arch sedge hand look see empty float rose leave open water speak look beautiful wild face eye forest darkness moonlit mountain loveliness angry sad 
24,"""Tell me, O Water-midden, where is my Wonderstone?"" he said.",tell say 
25,"The Water-midden smoothed slowly back her gold locks. ""You told me false, Mulla-mulgar,"" she answered. ""All day long have I been sitting rubbing, rubbing with my small tired thumb, but no magic has answered. It is but a common water-pebble roughened into the beasts' shapes. It means nothing, and I am weary.""",midden smooth gold lock tell false mulgar answer day sit rub rub small tired thumb magic answer common water pebble roughen beast shape mean weary 
26,"And Nod guessed she had been rubbing the Wonderstone craft to cudgel, and not as the magic went, sama-weeza--right to left.",guess rub craft cudgel magic go right leave 
27,"""If it is but a water-pebble, give it back to me, then, Midden, for it was my mother who gave it me.""",water pebble give mother give 
28,"But the Midden smiled with her red lips. ""You did deceive me, then, Mulla-mulgar, so that you might seem strange and wonderful, and far above the other hoarse-voiced travellers, the beloved of Tishnar? You may deceive me again, perhaps. I think I will not give you back your stone. Perhaps, too,"" she said, throwing back her tiny chin, so that her face lay like a flower in leaves of gold--""perhaps I rubbed not wisely. You shall tell me how.""",smile red lip deceive mulgar seem strange wonderful other hoarse voice traveller beloved deceive think give stone say throw tiny chin face lay flower leave gold rub tell 
29,"""Show me, then, my Wonderstone. I am tired out for want of sleep, and long no more for Tishnar's fountains.""",show tired want sleep more fountain 
30,"Then the Midden floated out into the middle of the stream, and with one light hand kept herself in front of Nod, her narrow shoulders slowly twirling the while in the faintly-rosied starlight. She took with the other a long thick strand of her hair, and, unwinding it slowly, presently out of it let fall into her palm the angry-flaming Wonderstone. ""See, Mulla-mulgar, here is your Wonderstone. Now in patience tell me how to make magic.""",float middle stream light hand keep front narrow shoulder twirl while rosied starlight take other long thick strand hair unwind let fall palm angry flaming see patience tell make magic 
31,"And Nod said softly: ""Float but a span nearer to me, Midden--a span and just a half a span.""",say float span span span 
32,"And the Water-midden drew in a little, still softly twirling.",midden draw little twirl 
33,"""Oh, but just a thumb-nail nearer,"" said Nod.",thumb nail say 
34,"Laughing, she floated in closer yet, till her beautiful eyes were looking up into his bony and wrinkled face. Then with a sudden spring he thrust his hand deep into the silken mesh of her hair and held tight.",laugh float beautiful eye look bony wrinkled face sudden spring thrust hand silken mesh hair hold tight 
35,"She moved not a finger; she still looked laughing up. ""Listen, listen, Midden,"" he said: ""I will not harm you--I could not harm you, beautiful one, though you never gave me back my Wonderstone again, and I wandered forsaken till I died of hunger in the forest. What use is the stone to you now? Tishnar is angry. See how wildly it burns and sulks. Give it, then, into my hand, and I promise--not a promise, Midden, fading in one evening--I will give you any one thing else whatsoever it is you ask.""",move finger look laugh listen listen say harm harm beautiful one give wander forsaken die hunger forest use stone angry see burn sulk give hand promise promise fade evening give thing else ask 
36,"And the Water-midden looked up at him unfrightened, and saw the truth and kindness in his eyes. ""Be not angry with me, little brother,"" she answered. ""I did not pretend with you, sorrowful Nizza-neela!"" And she dropped the Wonderstone into his outstretched hand.",midden look unfrightened see truth kindness eye angry little brother answer pretend sorrowful drop outstretched hand 
37,"Tears sprang up into Nod's tired, aching eyes. He smoothed softly with his hairy fingers the golden strands floating in the ice-cold water. ""Till I die, O beautiful one,"" he said, ""I will not forget you. Tell me your wish!""",tear spring tired ach eye smooth hairy finger golden strand float ice cold water die beautiful one say forget tell wish 
38,"Then the Water-midden looked long and gravely at him out of darkling eyes. She put out her hand and touched his. ""This shall be my sorrowful wish, little Mulgar: it is that when you and your brothers come at last to the Kingdom of Assasimmon, and the Valleys of Tishnar, you will not forget me.""",midden look long darkling eye put hand touch sorrowful wish little brother come last forget 
39,"""O Midden,"" Nod answered, ""it needed no asking--that. It may be we shall never reach the Valleys. For now we must plunge into the water-cavern on our floating rafts, and all is haste and danger. But I mind no danger now, Midden. That Mulla-mulgar, my father Seelem, chose to wander, and not to sit fat and idle with Princes. So, too, would I. Tell me a harder wish. Ask anything, Water-midden, and my Wonderstone shall give it you.""",answer need ask reach plunge water cavern float raft haste danger mind danger mulgar father choose wander sit fat idle tell hard wish ask water midden give 
40,"And the Water-midden gazed sorrowfully into his face. ""That is all I ask, Mulla-mulgar,"" she repeated softly--""that you will not forget me. I fear the Wonderstone. All day it has been crickling and burning in my hair. All that I ask, I ask only of you."" So Nod stooped once more over that gold and beauty, and he promised the Water-midden.",midden gaze face ask mulgar repeat forget fear day crickle burn hair ask ask stoop gold beauty promise midden 
41,"And she drew out a slender, fine strand of her hair, and cut it through with the sharp edge of a little shell, and she wound it seven times round Nod's left wrist. ""There,"" she said; ""that will bid you remember me when you come to the end. Have no fear of the waters, Nizza-neela; my people will watch over you.""",draw slender fine strand hair cut sharp edge little shell wind time left wrist say bid remember come end have fear water person watch 
42,"And Nod could not think what in his turn to give the Water-midden for a remembrance and a keepsake. So he gave her Battle's silver groat with the hole in it, and hung it upon a slender shred of Cullum round her neck, and he tore off also one of the five out of his nine ivory buttons that still clung to his coat, and gave her that, too.",think turn give midden remembrance keepsake give silver groat hole hang slender shred neck tore ivory button cling coat give 
43,"""And if my brothers stay here one day more, come in the darkness, O Water-midden; I shall not sleep for thinking of you."" And he said good-bye to her, kneeling above the dark water. But long after he had safely wrapped his Wonderstone in the blood-stained leaf from Battle's little book again, and had huddled himself down beside the slumbering travellers, he still seemed to hear the forlorn singing of the Water-midden, and in his eyes her small face haunted, amid the darkness of his dreams.",brother stay day come darkness midden sleep think say good bye kneel dark water wrap blood stain leaf little book huddle slumber traveller seem hear forlorn singing midden eye small face haunt darkness dream 
44,"All the next morning the travellers slaved at their rafts. They made them narrow and buoyant and very strong, for they knew not what might lie beyond the mouth of the cavern. And now the sun shone down so fiercely that the Mulgars, climbing, hacking, dragging at the branches, and moiling to and fro betwixt forest and water, teased by flies and stinging ants, hardly knew what to do for the heat. Thumb and Thimble stripped off the few rags left of their red jackets, and worked in their skins with better comfort. And they laughed at Nod for sweating on in his wool.",next morning traveller slave raft make narrow buoyant strong know lie mouth cavern sun shine climb hack drag branch moil betwixt forest water tease fly sting ant know do heat stripp few rag leave red jacket work skin good comfort laugh sweat wool 
45,"""Look, Thumb,"" laughed Thimble, peering out from under a tower of greenery, ""the little Prince is so vain of his tattered old sheep's-jacket that he won't walk in his bare an instant, yet he is so hot he can scarcely breathe.""",look laugh peer tower greenery little vain tatter old sheep jacket walk bare instant hot breathe 
46,"Nod made no answer, but worked stolidly on, bunched up in his hot jacket, because he feared if he went bare his brothers would see the thin strand of bright hair about his wrist, and mock at the Midden. When the sun was at noon the Mulgars had finished the building of their rafts. They lay merrily bobbing in a long string moored to an Ollaconda on the swift-running water. They tied up bundles of nuts, and old Nanoes, roots, and pepper-pods, and scores of torches, and bound these down securely to the smallest of the rafts. Then, wearied out, with sting-swollen chops and bleeding hands, they raised their shadow-blankets, and having bound up their heads with cool leaves, all lay down beside the embers of their last night's fire for the ""glare.""",make answer work bunch hot jacket fear go brother see thin strand bright hair wrist mock sun noon finish building raft lay bob long string moor swift run water tie bundle nut old nanoe root pepper pod score torche bind small raft weary sting swollen chop bleeding hand raise shadow blanket bind head cool leave lay ember last night fire glare 
47,"There were now seventeen travellers, and they had built nine light rafts--two Mulgars for every raft, except two; one of which two was wide enough to float in comfort three of the lighter Moona-mulgars, who weigh scarce more than Meermuts at the best of times; the other and least was for their bundles and torches and all such stuff as they needed, over and above what each Mulgar carried for himself.",be traveller build light raft raft wide float comfort light mulgar weigh scarce more good time other least bundle torche such stuff need carry 
48,"In the full and stillness of afternoon they ate their last meal this side of Arakkaboa, and beat out their fire. A sprinkle of hail fell, hopping on their heads as they stood in the sunshine making ready to put off. It seemed as if there would never come an end to their labour, and many a strange face stared down on them from the brooding galleries of the forest.",full stillness afternoon eat last meal side beat fire sprinkle hail fall hopping head stand sunshine make ready put seem come end labour many strange face stare brooding gallery forest
