1,CHAPTER XIII. THE COURTSHIP IN THE ORCHARD.,courtship 
2," The next morning Bevis's papa looking at the almanac found there was going to be an eclipse of the sun, so Bevis took a piece of glass (part of one of the many window panes he had broken) and smoked it over a candle, so as to be able to watch the phenomenon without injury to his eyes. When the obscuration began too, the dairy-maid brought him a bucket of clear water in which the sun was reflected and could be distinctly seen. But before the eclipse had proceeded beyond the mere edge of the sun, Bevis heard the champing of a bit, and the impatient pawing of hoofs, and running up to the stable to see who it was, found that his papa was just on the point of driving over in the dog-cart to see another farmer (the very old gentleman in whose orchard Kapchack's palace was situated) about a load of straw.",next morning papa look almanac find go eclipse sun take piece glass part many window pane break smoke candle able watch phenomenon injury eye obscuration begin dairy maid bring bucket clear water sun reflect see eclipse proceed mere edge sun hear champing bit impatient paw hoof run stable see find papa point drive dog cart see farmer old gentleman orchard palace situate load straw 
3,"Bevis of course insisted upon going too, the smoked glass was thrown aside, he clambered up and held the reins, and away they went, the eclipse now counting for nothing. After a while, however, as they went swiftly along the road, they came to a hill, and from the summit saw a long way off a vast shadow like that cast by some immense cloud which came towards them over the earth, and in a second or two arrived, and as it were put out the light. They looked up and the sun was almost gone. In its place was a dark body, with a rim of light round it, and flames shooting forth.",course insist go smoke glass throw clamber hold rein go eclipse count while go road come hill summit see long way vast shadow cast immense cloud come earth second arrive put light look sun gone place dark body rim light flame shoot 
4,"As they came slowly down the hill a pheasant crowed as he flew up to roost, the little birds retired to the thickets, and at the farmyards they passed the fowls went up to their perches. Presently they left the highway and drove along a lane across the fields, which had once been divided from each other by gates. Of these there was nothing now standing but the posts, some of which could hardly be said to stand, but declining from the perpendicular, were only kept from falling by the bushes. The lane was so rough and so bad from want of mending that they could only walk the impatient horse, and at times the jolting was extremely unpleasant.",come hill pheasant crow fly roost little bird retire thicket farmyard pass fowl go perche leave highway drive lane field divide other gate be standing post say stand decline perpendicular keep fall bush lane rough bad want mend walk impatient horse time jolting unpleasant 
5,"Sometimes they had to stoop down in the trap to pass under the drooping boughs of elms and other trees, which not having been cut for years, hung over and almost blocked the track. From the hedges the brambles and briars extended out into the road, so that the wheels of the dog-cart brushed them, and they would evidently have entirely shut up the way had not waggons occasionally gone through and crushed their runners. The meadows on either hand were brown with grass that had not been mown, though the time for mowing had long since gone by, while the pastures were thick with rushes and thistles. Though so extensive there were only two or three cows in them, and these old and poor, and as it were broken-down. No horses were visible, nor any men at work.",have stake trap pass droop bough elm other tree cut year hang block track hedge bramble briar extend road wheel dog cart brush shut way waggon go crush runner meadow hand brown grass mown time mowing go pasture thick rushe thistle extensive be cow old poor break horse visible man work 
6,"There were other fields which had once grown wheat, but were now so choked with weeds as to be nothing but a wilderness. As they approached the farmhouse where the old gentleman dwelt, the signs of desolation became more numerous. There were walls that had fallen, and never been repaired, around whose ruins the nettles flourished. There were holes in the roofs of the sheds exposing the rafters.",be other field grow wheat choke weed wilderness approach farmhouse old gentleman dwele sign desolation become numerous be wall fall repair ruin nettle flourish be hole roof shed expose rafter 
7,"Trees had fallen and lay as they fell, rotting away, and not even cut up for firewood. Railings had decayed till there was nothing left but a few stumps; gates had dropped from their hinges, and nothing of them remained but small bits of rotten board attached to rusty irons. In the garden all was confusion, the thistles rose higher than the gooseberry bushes, and burdocks looked in at the windows. From the wall of the house a pear that had been trained there had fallen away, and hung suspended, swinging with every puff; the boughs, driven against the windows, had broken the panes in the adjacent casement; other panes which had been broken were stuffed up with wisps of hay.",tree fall lay fall rot cut firewood railing decay be leave few stump gate drop hinge remain small bit rotten board attach rusty iron garden confusion thistle rise high gooseberry bush burdock look window wall house pear train fall hang suspend swing puff bough drive window break pane adjacent casement other pane break stuff wisp hay 
8,"Tiles had slipped from the roof, and the birds went in and out as they listed. The remnants of the tiles lay cracked upon the ground beneath the eaves just as they had fallen. No hand had touched them; the hand of man indeed had touched nothing. Bevis, whose eyes were everywhere, saw all these things in a minute. ""Why,"" said he, ""there's the knocker; it has tumbled down."" It had dropped from the door as the screws rusted; the door itself was propped up with a log of wood. But one thing only appeared to have been attended to, and that was the wall about the orchard, which showed traces of recent mortar, and the road leading towards it, which had not long since been mended with flints.",tile slip roof bird go list remnant tile crack ground eave fall hand touch hand man touch eye see thing minute say be knocker tumble drop door screw rust door proppe log wood thing appear attend wall orchard show trace recent mortar road lead mend flint 
9,"Now Bevis, as I say, noting all these things as they came near with his eyes, which, like gimlets, went through everything, was continually asking his papa questions about them, and why everything was in such a state, till at last his papa, overwhelmed with his inquiries, promised to tell him the whole story when they got home. This he did, but while they are now fastening up the horse (for there was no one to help them or mind it), and while Bevis is picking up the rusty knocker, the story may come in here very well:--",say note thing come eye gimlet go ask papa question state last papa overwhelm inquiry promise tell whole story get fasten horse be help mind pick rusty knocker story come 
10,"Once upon a time, many, many years ago, when the old gentleman was young, and lived with his mother at the farmhouse, it happened that he fell in love. The lady he loved was very young, very beautiful, very proud, very capricious, and very poor. She lived in a house in the village little better than a cottage, with an old woman who was said to be her aunt. As the young farmer was well off, for the land was his own, and he had no one to keep but his old mother, and as the young lady dearly loved him, there seemed no possible obstacle in their way. But it is well known that a brook can never run straight, and thus, though all looked so smooth, there were, in reality, two difficulties.",time many many year old gentleman young live mother farmhouse happen fall love lady love young beautiful proud capricious poor live house village little good cottage old woman say aunt young farmer land own have keep old mother young lady love seem possible obstacle way know brook run look smooth be reality difficulty 
11,"The first of these was the farmer's old mother, who having been mistress in the farmhouse for very nearly fifty years, did not like, after half-a-century, to give place to a mere girl. She could not refrain from uttering disparaging remarks about her, to which her son, being fond of his mother, could not reply, though it angered him to the heart, and at such times he used to take down his long single-barrelled gun with brass fittings, and go out shooting. More than once the jealous mother had insulted the young lady openly in the village street, which conduct, of course, as things fly from roof to roof with the sparrows, was known all over the place, and caused the lady to toss her head like a filly in spring to show that she did not care for such an old harridan, though in secret it hurt her pride beyond expression.",first farmer old mother mistress farmhouse year like half century give place mere girl refrain utter disparaging remark son fond mother reply anger heart such time use take long single barrell gun brass fitting go shooting more jealous mother insult young lady village street conduct course thing fly roof roof sparrow know place cause lady toss head filly spring show care old harridan secret hurt pride expression 
12,"So great was the difficulty this caused, that the young lady, notwithstanding she was so fond of the handsome young farmer, who rode so well and shot so straight, and could carry her in his arms as if she were no more than a lamb, would never put her dainty foot, which looked so little and pretty even in the rude shoes made for her by the village cobbler, over the threshold of his house. She would never come in, she said, except as a wife, while he on his part, anxious as he was to marry her, could not, from affection for his mother, summon up courage to bring her in, as it were, rough-shod over his mother's feelings.",great difficulty cause young lady fond handsome young farmer ride shoot carry arm more lamb put dainty foot look little rude shoe make village cobbler threshold house come say wife part anxious marry affection mother summon courage bring rough shod mother feeling 
13,"Their meetings, therefore, as she would not come indoors, were always held in the farmer's orchard, where was a seat in an arbour, a few yards in front of which stood the ancient apple-tree in which Kapchack, who was also very young in those days, had built his nest. At this arbour they met every day, and often twice a day, and even once again in the evening, and could there chat and make love as sweetly as they pleased, because the orchard was enclosed by a high wall which quite shut out all spying eyes, and had a gate with lock and key. The young lady had a duplicate key, and came straight to the orchard from the cottage where she lived by a footpath which crossed the lane along which Bevis had been driven.",meeting come hold farmer orchard seat arbour few yard front stand ancient apple tree young day build nest arbour meet day day evening chat make love pleased orchard enclose high wall shut spying eye have gate lock key young lady have duplicate key come orchard cottage live footpath cross lane drive 
14,"It happened that the footpath just by the lane, on coming near the orchard, passed a moist place, which in rainy weather was liable to be flooded, and as this was inconvenient for her, her lover had a waggon-load of flints brought down from the hills where the hares held their revels, and placed in the hollow so as to fill it up, and over these he placed faggots of nut-tree wood, so that she could step across perfectly clean and dry. In this orchard, then, they had their constant rendezvous; they were there every day when the nightingale first began to sing in the spring, and when the apple-trees were hidden with their pink blossom, when the haymakers were at work in the meadow, when the reapers cut the corn, and when the call of the first fieldfare sounded overhead. The golden and rosy apples dropped at their feet, they laughed and ate them, and taking out the brown pips she pressed them between her thumb and finger to see how far they would shoot.",happen footpath lane come orchard pass moist place rainy weather liable flood inconvenient lover have waggon load flint bring hill hare hold revel place hollow fill place faggot nut tree wood step clean dry orchard have constant rendezvous day nightingale first begin sing spring apple tree hide pink blossom haymaker work meadow reaper cut corn call first fieldfare sound golden rosy apple drop foot laugh eat take brown pip press thumb finger see shoot 
15,"Though they had begun to talk about their affairs in the spring, and had kept on all the summer and autumn, and though they kept on as often as the weather was dry (when they walked up and down the long orchard for warmth, sheltered by the wall), yet when the spring came again they had not half finished. Thus they were very happy, and the lady used particularly to laugh at the antics of the magpie, who became so accustomed to their presence as to go on with the repairs to his nest without the least shyness. Kapchack, being then very young and full of spirits, and only just married, and in the honeymoon of prosperity, played such freaks and behaved in so amusing a manner that the lady became quite attached to him, and in order to protect her favourite, her lover drove away all the other large birds that came near the orchard, and would not permit any one whatever to get up into Kapchack's apple-tree, nor even to gather the fruit, which hung on the boughs till the wind pushed it off.",begin talk affair spring keep summer autumn keep weather dry walk long orchard warmth shelter wall spring come half finish happy lady use laugh antic magpie become accustomed presence go repair nest least shyness young full spirit marry honeymoon prosperity play such freak behave amusing manner lady become attach order protect favourite lover drive other large bird come orchard permit one get apple tree gather fruit hang bough wind push 
16,"Thus, having a fortress to retreat to, and being so highly honoured of men, Kapchack gave the reins to his natural audacity, and succeeded in obtaining the sovereignty. When the spring came again they had still a great deal of talking to do; but whether the young lady was weary of waiting for the marriage-ring, or whether she was jealous of the farmer's mother, or whether she thought they might continue like this for the next ten years if she did not make some effort, or whether it was the worldly counsels of her aunt, or what it was--perhaps her own capricious nature, it is certain that they now began to quarrel a little about another gentleman.",have fortress retreat honoure man give rein natural audacity succeed obtain sovereignty spring come have great deal talking do young lady weary wait marriage ring jealous farmer mother think continue next year make effort worldly counsel aunt own capricious nature certain begin quarrel little gentleman 
17,"This gentleman was very rich, and the owner of a large estate in the neighbourhood; he did not often reside there, for he did not care for sport or country life, but once when he came down he happened to see the young lady, and was much attracted towards her. Doubtless she did not mean any harm, but she could not help liking people to admire her, and, not to go into every little particular, in the course of time (and not very long either) she and the gentleman became acquainted. Now, when her own true lover was aware of this, he was so jealous that he swore if ever he saw them together he would shoot his rival with his long-barrelled gun, though he were hung for it the next day.",gentleman rich owner large estate neighbourhood reside care sport country life come happen see young lady attract mean harm help like person admire go little particular course time gentleman become acquainted own true lover aware jealous swore see shoot rival long barrell gun hang next day 
18,"The lady was not a little pleased at this frantic passion, and secretly liked him ten times better for it, though she immediately resorted to every artifice to calm his anger, for she knew his violent nature, and that he was quite capable of doing as he had said. But the delight of two strings to her bow was not easily to be foregone, and thus, though she really loved the farmer, she did not discourage the gentleman. He, on his part, finding after a while that although she allowed him to talk to her, and even to visit her at the cottage, and sometimes (when she knew the young farmer was at market) go for a walk with him, and once even came and went over his grand mansion, still finding that it was all talk, and that his suit got no further, he presently bethought him of diamonds.",lady little pleased frantic passion like time good resort artifice calm anger know violent nature capable do say delight string bow foregone love farmer discourage gentleman part find while allow talk visit cottage know young farmer market go walk come go grand mansion find talk suit get bethough diamond 
19,"He gave her a most beautiful diamond locket, which he had had down all fresh and brilliant from London. Now this was the beginning of the mischief. She accepted it in a moment of folly, and wished afterwards ten times that she had refused, but having once put it on, it looked so lovely she could not send it back. She could not openly wear it, lest her lover should see it, but every morning she put it on indoors, and frequently glanced in the glass.",give beautiful diamond locket have fresh brilliant beginning mischief accept moment folly wish time refuse put look lovely send wear lover see morning put glance glass 
20,"Nor is it any use to find fault with her; for in the first place she has been dead many years, and in the second she was then very young, very beautiful, and living quite alone in the world with an old woman. Now her lover, notwithstanding the sweet assurances she gave him of her faithfulness, and despite the soft kisses he had in abundance every day in the orchard, soft as the bloom of the apple-trees, could not quite recover his peace of mind. He did not laugh as he used to do. He was restless, and the oneness of his mind was gone. Oneness of mind does not often last long into life, but while it lasts everything is bright. He had now always a second thought, a doubt behind, which clouded his face and brought a line into his forehead.",use find fault first place dead many year second young beautiful live alone world old woman lover notwithstand sweet assurance give faithfulness soft kisse have abundance day orchard soft bloom apple tree recover peace mind laugh use do restless oneness mind gone oneness mind last life last bright second thought doubt cloude face bring line forehead 
21,"After a time his mother, observing his depression, began to accuse herself of unkindness, and at last resolved to stand no longer in the way of the marriage. She determined to quit the house in which she had lived ever since she came to it a happy bride half-a-century before. Having made up her mind, that very morning she walked along the footpath to the young lady's cottage, intending to atone for her former unkindness, and to bring the girl back to lunch, and thus surprise her son when he came in from the field.",time mother observe depression begin accuse unkindness last resolve stand way marriage determine quit house live come happy bride half century make mind very morning walk footpath young lady cottage intend atone former unkindness bring girl lunch surprise son come field 
22,"She had even made up her mind to put up with the cold reception she would probably meet with, nor to reply if any hard words were used towards her. Thus thinking, she lifted the latch, as country people do not use much ceremony, and stepped into the cottage, when what was her surprise to find the girl she had come to see with a beautiful diamond locket about her neck, gleaming in the sunshine from the open door! She instantly understood what it meant, and upbraiding the girl with her falseness, quitted the place, and lost no time in telling her son, but first she took the precaution of hiding his gun. As he could not find that weapon, after the first storm of his jealous anger had gone over he shut himself up in his room.",make mind put cold reception meet reply hard word use think lift latch country person use much ceremony step cottage surprise find girl come see beautiful diamond locket neck gleam sunshine open door understand mean upbraid girl falseness quit place lose time tell son take precaution hide gun find weapon first storm jealous anger go shut room 
23,"The lady came the same evening to the rendezvous in the orchard, but her lover did not meet her. She came again next day, and in the evening; and again the third day, and so all through the week, and for nearly a month doing all she could without actually entering the house to get access to him. But he sullenly avoided her; once seeing her in the road, he leaped his horse over the hedge rather than pass her. For the diamond locket looked so like a price--as if she valued a glittering bauble far above true love.",lady come same evening rendezvous orchard lover meet come next day evening third day week month do enter house get access avoid see road leap horse hedge pass diamond locket look price value glitter bauble true love 
24,"At last one day she surprised him at the corner of the village street, and notwithstanding that the people (who knew all the story) were looking on, she would speak to him. She walked by his side, and said: ""George, I have put the locket in the arbour, with a letter for you. If you will not speak to me, read the letter, and throw the locket in the brook.""",last day surprise corner village street notwithstand person know story look speak walk side say put locket arbour letter speak read letter throw locket brook 
25,"More she could not say, for he walked as fast as he could, and soon left her behind.",more say walk leave 
26,"He would not go near the orchard all day, but at last in the evening something prompted him to go. He went and looked, but the locket and the letter were not there.",go orchard day last evening prompt go go look locket letter 
27,"Either she had not left them as she had said, or else some one had taken them. No one could enter the orchard without a key, unless they went to the trouble of bringing a ladder from the rickyard, and as it was spring, there were no apples to tempt them to do that. He thought, perhaps, his mother might have taken his key and gone to the arbour, and there was a terrible scene and bitter words between them--the first time he had ever replied to her. The consequence was that she packed a chest that very day, took a bag of money, which in old-fashioned style she kept under her bed, and left her home for ever; but not before she had been to the cottage, and reviled the girl with her duplicity and her falseness, declaring that if she had not got the locket, she had not put it in the orchard, but had sold it, like the hussy she was! Fortunately, however, she added, George could now see through her.",leave say one take enter orchard key go trouble bring ladder rickyard spring be apple temp do think mother take key go arbour be terrible scene bitter word first time reply consequence pack chest day take bag money old fashioned style keep bed leave home cottage revile girl duplicity falseness declare get locket put orchard sell hussy add see 
28,"The farmer himself, much agitated at his mother's departure, made another search for the locket, and mowed the grass in the orchard himself, thinking that perhaps the lady had dropped it, or that it had caught in her dress and dragged along, and he also took the rake, and turned over every heap of dead leaves which the wind had blown into the corners. But there was no locket and no letter. At last he thought that perhaps the magpie, Kapchack--as magpies were always famous for their fondness for glittering things, such as silver spoons--might have picked up the locket, attracted by the gleaming diamonds. He got a ladder and searched the nest, even pulling part of it to pieces, despite Kapchack's angry remonstrances, but the locket was not there.",farmer agitate mother departure make search locket mow grass orchard think lady drop catch dress drag take rake turn heap dead leave wind blow corner be locket letter last think magpie magpie famous fondness glitter thing such silver spoon pick locket attract gleam diamond get ladder search nest pull part piece angry remonstrance locket 
29,"As he came down the ladder there was the young lady, who had stolen into the orchard and watched his operations. They stood and faced each other for a minute: at least, she looked at him, _his_ sullen gaze was bent upon the ground. As for her, the colour came and went in her cheek, and her breast heaved so that, for a while, she could not speak. At last she said very low: ""So you do not believe me, but some day you will know that you have judged me wrongly"". Then she turned, and without another word went swiftly from the orchard.",come ladder be young lady steal orchard watch operation stand face other minute least look sullen gaze bend ground colour come go cheek breast heave while speak last say low believe day know judge turn word go orchard 
30,"He did not follow her, and he never saw her again. The same evening she left the village, she and the old woman, her aunt, quietly and without any stir, and where they went (beyond the market town) no one knew or even heard. And the very same evening, too, the rich gentleman who had given her the locket, and who made an unwonted stay in his country home because of her, also left the place, and went, as was said, to London. Of course people easily put two and two together, and said no doubt the girl had arranged to meet her wealthy admirer, but no one ever saw them together. Not even the coachman, when the gentleman once more returned home years afterwards, though the great authority in those days, could say what had become of her; if she had met his master it was indeed in some secret and mysterious manner. But the folk, when he had done speaking, and had denied these things, after he had quaffed his ale and departed, nudged each other, and said that no doubt his master, foreseeing the inquiries that would be made, had bribed him with a pocketful of guineas to hold his tongue.",follow see same evening leave village old woman aunt stir go market town know hear same evening rich gentleman give locket make unwonted stay country home leave place go say course person put say doubt girl arrange meet wealthy admirer see coachman gentleman return year great authority day say become meet master secret mysterious manner folk do speak deny thing quaff ale depart nudge other say doubt master foresee inquiry make bribe pocketful guinea hold tongue 
31,"So the farmer, in one day, found himself alone; his dear lady, his mother, and his rival were gone. He alone remained, and alone he remained for the rest of his days. His rival, indeed, came back once now and then for short periods to his mansion; but his mother never returned, and died in a few years' time. Then indeed deserted, the farmer had nothing left but to cultivate, and dwell on, the memory of the past. He neglected his business, and his farm; he left his house to take care of itself; the cows wandered away, the horses leaped the hedges, other people's cattle entered his corn, trampled his wheat, and fattened on his clover. He did nothing. The hand of man was removed, and the fields, and the house, and the owner himself, fell to decay.",farmer day find alone dear lady mother rival gone remain remain rest day rival come short period mansion mother return die few year time desert farmer have leave cultivate dwell memory past neglect business farm leave house take care cow wander horse leap hedge other person cattle enter corn trample wheat fatten clover do hand man remove field house owner fall decay 
32,"Years passed, and still it was the same, and thus it was, that when Bevis and his papa drove up, Bevis was so interested and so inquisitive about the knocker, which had fallen from the front door. One thing, and one place only, received the owner's care, and that was the orchard, the arbour, the magpie's nest, and the footpath that led to the orchard gate. Everything else fell to ruin, but these were very nearly in the same state as when the young lady used to come to the orchard daily. For the old gentleman, as he grew old, and continued to dwell yet more and more upon the happy days so long gone by, could not believe that she could be dead, though he himself had outlived the usual span of life.",year pass same papa drive interested inquisitive knocker fall front door thing place receive owner care orchard arbour magpie nest footpath lead orchard gate else fall ruin same state young lady use come orchard old gentleman grow old continue dwell more happy day go believe dead outlive usual span life 
33,"He was quite certain that she would some day come back, for she had said so herself; she had said that some day he would know that he had judged her wrongly, and unless she came back it was not possible for him to understand. He was, therefore, positively certain that some day she would come along the old footpath to the gate in the orchard wall, open it with her duplicate key, walk to the arbour and sit down, and smile at the magpie's ways. The woodwork of the arbour had of course decayed long since, but it had been carefully replaced, so that it appeared exactly the same as when she last sat within it. The coping fell from the orchard wall, but it was put back; the gate came to pieces, but a new one was hung in its place.",certain day come say say day know judge come possible understand certain day come old footpath gate orchard wall open duplicate key walk arbour sit smile magpie way woodwork arbour course decay replace appear same sit coping fall orchard wall put gate come piece new one hang place 
34,"Kapchack, thus protected, still came to his palace, which had reached an enormous size from successive additions and annual repairs. As the time went on people began to talk about Kapchack, and the extraordinary age to which he had now attained, till, by-and-by, he became the wonder of the place, and in order to see how long he would live, the gentlemen who had gamekeepers in the neighbourhood instructed them to be careful not to shoot him. His reputation extended with his years, and those curious in such things came to see him from a distance, but could never obtain entrance to the orchard, nor approach near his tree, for neither money nor persuasion could induce the owner to admit them.",protect come palace reach enormous size successive addition annual repair time go person begin talk extraordinary age attain become wonder place order see live gentleman have gamekeeper neighbourhood instruct careful shoot reputation extend year curious such thing come see distance obtain entrance orchard approach tree money persuasion induce owner admit 
35,"In and about the village itself Kapchack was viewed by the superstitious with something like awe. His great age, his singular fortune, his peculiar appearance--having but one eye--gave him a wonderful prestige, and his chattering was firmly believed to portend a change of the weather or the wind, or even the dissolution of village personages. The knowledge that he was looked upon in this light rendered the other birds and animals still more obedient than they would have been. Kapchack was a marvel, and it gradually became a belief with them that he would never die.",village view superstitious awe great age singular fortune peculiar appearance have eye- give wonderful prestige chattering believe portend change weather wind dissolution village personage knowledge look light render other bird animal obedient marvel become belief die 
36,"Outside the orchard-gate, the footpath which crossed the lane, and along which the lady used to come, was also carefully kept in its former condition. By degrees the nut-tree faggots rotted away--they were supplanted by others; in the process of time the flints sunk into the earth, and then another waggon-load was sent for. But the waggons had all dropped to pieces except one which chanced to be under cover; this, too, was much decayed, still it held together enough for the purpose. It was while this very waggon was jolting down from the hills with a load of flints to fill this hollow that the one particular flint, out of five thousand, worked its way through a hole in the bottom and fell on the road. And the rich old gentleman, whose horse stepped on it the same evening, who was thrown from the dog-cart, and whose discharged groom shot him in his house in London, was the very same man who, years and years before, had given the diamond locket to the young lady.",orchard gate footpath cross lane lady use come keep former condition degree nut tree faggot rott supplant other process time flint sink earth waggon load send waggon drop piece chance cover decay hold purpose very waggon jolt hill load flint fill hollow particular flint work way hole bottom fall road rich old gentleman horse step same evening throw dog cart discharge groom shoot house same man year year give diamond locket young lady 
37,"In the orchard the old farmer pottered about every day, now picking up the dead wood which fell from the trees, now raking up the leaves, and gathering the fruit (except that on Kapchack's tree), now mowing the grass, according to the season, now weeding the long gravel path at the side under the sheltering wall, up and down which the happy pair had walked in the winters so long ago. The butterflies flew over, the swallows alighted on the topmost twigs of the tall pear-tree and twittered sweetly, the spiders spun their webs, or came floating down on gossamer year after year, but he did not notice that they were not the same butterflies or the same swallows which had been there in his youth. Everything was the same to him within the orchard, however much the world might change without its walls.",orchard old farmer potter day pick dead wood fall tree rake leave gather fruit tree mow grass accord season weed long gravel path side shelter wall happy pair walk winter butterfly fly swallow alight topmost twig tall pear tree twitter spider spun web come float gossamer year year notice same butterfly same swallow youth same orchard world change wall 
38,"Why, the very houses in the village close by had many of them fallen and been rebuilt; there was scarcely a resident left who dwelt there then; even the ancient and unchangeable church was not the same--it had been renovated; why, even the everlasting hills were different, for the slopes were now in many places ploughed, and grew oats where nothing but sheep had fed. But all within the orchard was the same; his lady, too, was the same without doubt, and her light step would sooner or later come down the footpath to her lover. This was the story Bevis's papa told him afterwards.",very house village have many fall rebuild be resident leave dwele ancient unchangeable church same renovate everlasting hill different slope many place plough grow oat sheep feed orchard same lady same doubt light step come footpath lover story papa tell 
39,"They had some difficulty in fastening up the horse, until they pulled some hay from a hayrick, and spread it before him, for like Bevis he had to be bribed with cake, as it were, before he would be good. They then knocked at the front door, which was propped up with a beam of timber, but no one answered, nor did even a dog bark at the noise; indeed, the dog's kennel had entirely disappeared, and only a piece of the staple to which his chain had been fastened remained, a mere rusty stump in the wall. It was not possible to look into this room, because the broken windows were blocked with old sacks to keep out the draught and rain; but the window of the parlour was open, the panes all broken, and the casement loose, so that it must have swung and banged with the wind.",have difficulty fasten horse pull hay hayrick spread have bribe cake good knock front door proppe beam timber answer do dog bark noise dog kennel disappear piece staple chain fasten remain mere rusty stump wall possible look room break window block old sack keep draught rain window parlour open pane break casement swing bang wind 
40,"Within, the ceiling had fallen upon the table, and the chairs had mouldered away; the looking-glass on the mantelpiece was hidden with cobwebs, the cobwebs themselves disused; for as they collected the dust, the spiders at last left them to spin new ones elsewhere. The carpet, if it remained, was concealed by the dead leaves which had been carried in by the gales. On these lay one or two picture frames, the back part upwards, the cords had rotted from the nails, and as they dropped so they stayed. In a punch-bowl of ancient ware, which stood upon the old piano untouched all these years, a robin had had his nest. After Bevis had been lifted up to the window-ledge to look in at this desolation, they went on down towards the orchard, as if the old gentleman was not within he was certain to be there.",ceiling fall table chair moulder look glass mantelpiece hide cobweb cobweb disuse collect dust spider last leave spin new one carpet remain conceal dead leave carry gale lay picture frame back part cord rott nail drop stay punch bowl ancient ware stand old piano untouched year robin have nest lift window ledge look desolation go orchard old gentleman certain 
41,"They found the gate of the orchard open--rather an unusual thing, as he generally kept it locked, even when at work inside--and as they stepped in, they saw a modern double-barrel gun leant against a tree. A little farther, and Bevis caught sight of Kapchack's nest, like a wooden castle in the boughs, and clapped his hands with delight. But there was a ladder against Kapchack's tree, a thing which had not been seen there these years and years, and underneath the tree was the old farmer himself, pale as his own white beard, and only kept from falling to the ground by the strong arms of a young gentleman who upheld him. They immediately ran forward to see what was the matter.",find gate orchard open unusual thing keep lock work step see modern double barrel gun lean tree little far catch sight nest wooden castle bough clapp hand delight be ladder tree thing see year year tree old farmer pale own white beard keep fall ground strong arm young gentleman upheld run see matter 
42,"Now it had happened in this way. It will be recollected that when the keeper fell from the dead oak-tree, he not only disabled himself, but his gun going off shot the dogs. Thus when the heir to the estate came down the same evening, he found that there was neither dog nor keeper to go round with him the next day. But when the morning came, not to be deprived of his sport, he took his gun and went forth alone into the fields. He did not find much game, but he shot two or three partridges and a rabbit, and he was so tempted by the crowds of wood-pigeons that were about (parties from Choo Hoo's army out foraging), that he fired away the remaining cartridges in his pocket at them.",happen way recollect keeper fall dead oak tree disabled gun go shoot dog heir estate come same evening find be dog keeper go next day morning come deprive sport take gun go field find much game shoot partridge rabbit tempt crowd wood pigeon party army foraging fire remain cartridge pocket 
43,"So he found himself early in the day without a cartridge, and was just thinking of walking back to the house for some more, when the shadow of the eclipse came over. He stayed leaning against a gate to watch the sun, and presently as he was looking up at it a hare ran between his legs--so near, that had he seen her coming he could have caught her with his hands.",find day cartridge think walk house more shadow eclipse come stay lean gate watch sun look hare run leg see come catch hand 
44,"She only went a short way down the hedge, and he ran there, when she jumped out of the ditch, slipped by him, and went out fifty or sixty yards into the field, and sat up. How he now wished that he had not shot away all his ammunition at the wood-pigeons! While he looked at the hare she went on, crossed the field, and entered the hedge on the other side; he marked the spot, and hastened to get over the gate, with the intention of running home for cartridges. Hardly had he got over, than the hare came back again on that side of the hedge, passed close to him, and again leaped into the ditch. He turned to go after her, when out she came again, and crouched in a furrow only some twenty yards distant.",go short way hedge run jump ditch slip go yard field sit wish shoot ammunition wood pigeon look hare go cross field enter hedge other side mark spot hasten get gate intention run home cartridge get hare come side hedge pass leap ditch turn go come crouch furrow yard distant 
45,"Puzzled at this singular behaviour (for he had never seen a hare act like it before), he ran after her; and the curious part of it was, that although she did indeed run away, she did not go far--she kept only a few yards in front, just evading him. If she went into a hedge for shelter, she quickly came out again, and thus this singular chase continued for some time. He got quite hot running, for though he had not much hope of catching the creature, still he wanted to understand the cause of this conduct.",puzzle singular behaviour see hare act run curious part run go keep few yard front evade go hedge shelter come singular chase continue time get hot run have much hope catching creature want understand cause conduct 
46,"By-and-by the zig-zag and uncertain line they took led them close to the wall of the old gentleman's orchard, when suddenly a fox started out from the hedge, and rushed after the hare. The hare, alarmed to the last degree, darted into a large drain which went under the orchard, and the fox went in after her. The young gentleman ran to the spot, but could not of course see far up the drain. Much excited, he ran round the orchard wall till he came to the gate, which chanced to be open, because the farmer that day, having discovered that the great bough of Kapchack's tree had been almost torn from the trunk by the gale, had just carried a fresh piece of timber in for a new prop, and having his hands full, what with the prop and the ladder to fix it, he could not shut the gate behind him. So the sportsman entered the orchard, left his gun leaning against a tree, and running down to see if he could find which way the drain went, came upon the old gentleman, and caught sight of the extraordinary nest of old King Kapchack.",zig-zag uncertain line take lead wall old gentleman orchard fox start hedge rush hare hare alarm last degree dart large drain go orchard fox go young gentleman run spot course see drain excite run orchard wall come gate chance open farmer day discover great bough tree torn trunk gale carry fresh piece timber new prop have hand full prop ladder fix shut gate sportsman enter orchard leave gun lean tree run see find way drain go come old gentleman catch sight extraordinary nest old 
47,"Now the reason Ulu (for it was the very hare Bevis was so fond of) played these fantastic freaks, and ran almost into the very hands of the sportsman, was because the cunning fox had driven her to do so for his own purposes.",reason very hare fond play fantastic freak run very hand sportsman cunning fox drive do own purpose 
48,"After he learnt the mysterious underground saying from the toad imprisoned in the elm, he kept on thinking, and thinking, what it could mean; but he could not make it out. He was the only fox who had a grandfather living, and he applied to his grandfather, who after pondering on the matter all day, advised him to keep his eyes open. The fox turned up his nostrils at this advice, which seemed to him quite superfluous. However, next day, instead of going to sleep as usual, he did keep his eyes open, and by-and-by saw a notch on the edge of the sun, which notch grew bigger, until the shadow of the eclipse came over the ground.",learn mysterious underground say toad imprison elm keep think think mean make only fox have grandfather live apply grandfather ponder matter day advise keep eye open fox turn nostril advice seem superfluous next day go sleep usual keep eye open see notch edge sun notch grow big shadow eclipse come ground 
49,"At this he leaped up, recognising in a moment the dead day of the underground saying. He knew where Bevis's hare had her form, and immediately he raced across to her, though not clearly knowing what he was going to do; but as he crossed the fields he saw the sportsman, without any dogs and with an empty gun, leaning over the gate and gazing at the eclipse. With a snarl the fox drove Ulu from her form, and so worried her that she was obliged to run (to escape his teeth) right under the sportsman's legs, and thus to fulfil the saying: ""The hare hunted the hunter"".",leap recognise moment dead day underground say know hare have form race know go do cross field see sportsman dog empty gun lean gate gaze eclipse snarl fox drive form worry oblige run escape tooth sportsman leg fulfil saying hare hunt hunter 
50,"Even yet the fox did not know what was going to happen, or why he was doing this, for such is commonly the case during the progress of great events. The actors do not recognise the importance of the part they are playing. The age does not know what it is doing; posterity alone can appreciate it. But after a while, as the fox drove the hare out of the hedges, and met and faced her, and bewildered the poor creature, he observed that her zig-zag course, entirely unpremeditated, was leading them closer and closer to the orchard where Kapchack (whom he wished to overthrow) had his palace.",fox know go happen do such case progress great event actor recognise importance part play age know do posterity appreciate while fox drive hare hedge meet face bewilder poor creature observe zig zag course unpremeditated lead close close orchard wish overthrow have palace 
51,"Then beginning to see whither fate was carrying them, suddenly he darted out and drove the hare into the drain, and for safety followed her himself. He knew the drain very well, and that there was an outlet on the other side, having frequently visited the spot in secret in order to listen to what Kapchack was talking about. Ulu, quite beside herself with terror, rushed through the drain, leaving pieces of her fur against the projections of the stones, and escaped into the lane on the other side, and so into the fields there. The fox remained in the drain to hear what would happen.",begin see fate carry dart drive hare drain safety follow know drain be outlet other side visit spot secret order listen talk terror rush drain leave piece fur projection stone escape lane other side field fox remain drain hear happen 
52,"The sportsman ran round, entered the gate, and saw the old farmer trimming the prop, the ladder just placed against the tree, and caught sight of the palace of King Kapchack. As he approached a missel-thrush flew off--it was Eric; the farmer looked up at this, and saw the stranger, and was at first inclined to be very angry, for he had never been intruded upon before, but as the young gentleman at once began to apologise for the liberty, he overlooked it, and listened with interest to the story the sportsman told him of the vagaries of the hare. While they were talking the sportsman looked up several times at the nest above him, and felt an increasing curiosity to examine it. At last he expressed his wish; the farmer demurred, but the young gentleman pressed him so hard, and promised so faithfully not to touch anything, that at last the farmer let him go up the ladder, which he had only just put there, and which he had not himself as yet ascended.",sportsman run enter gate see old farmer trimm prop ladder place tree catch sight palace approach missel thrush fly farmer look see stranger first inclined angry intrude young gentleman begin apologise liberty overlook listen interest story sportsman tell vagary hare talk sportsman look several time nest feel increase curiosity examine last express wish farmer demurre young gentleman press promise touch last farmer let go ladder put ascend 
53,"The young gentleman accordingly went up the ladder, being the first who had been in that tree for years, and having examined and admired the nest, he was just going to descend, when he stayed a moment to look at the fractured bough. The great bough had not broken right off, but as the prop gave way beneath it had split at the part where it joined the trunk, leaving an open space, and revealing a hollow in the tree. In this hollow something caught his eye; he put in his hand and drew forth a locket, to which an old and faded letter was attached by a mouldy ribbon twisted round it. He cast this down to the aged farmer, who caught it in his hand, and instantly knew the locket which had disappeared so long ago.",young gentleman go ladder first tree year examine admire nest go descend stay moment look fracture bough great bough break prop give way split part join trunk leave open space reveal hollow tree hollow catch eye put hand draw locket old fade letter attach mouldy ribbon twist cast aged farmer catch hand know locket disappear 
54,"The gold was tarnished, but the diamonds were as bright as ever, and glittered in the light as the sun just then began to emerge from the eclipse. He opened the letter, scarce knowing what he did; the ink was faded and pale, but perfectly legible, for it had been in a dry place. The letter said that having tried in vain to get speech with him, and having faced all the vile slander and bitter remarks of the village for his sake, she had at last resolved to write and tell him that she was really and truly his own. In a moment of folly she had, indeed, accepted the locket, but that was all, and since the discovery she had twice sent it back, and it had twice been put on her dressing-table, so that she found it there in the morning (doubtless by the old woman, her aunt, bribed for the purpose).",gold tarnish diamond bright glitter light sun begin emerge eclipse open letter scarce know ink fade pale legible dry place letter say try vain get speech face vile slander bitter remark village sake resolve write tell own moment folly accept locket discovery send put dress table find morning old woman aunt bribe purpose 
55,"Then she thought that perhaps it would be better to give it to him (the farmer), else he might doubt that she had returned it; so she said, as he would not speak to her, she should leave it in the arbour, twisting the ribbon round her letter, and she begged him to throw the locket in the brook, and to believe her once again, or she should be miserable for life. But, if after this he still refused to speak to her, she would still stay a while and endeavour to obtain access to him; and if even then he remained so cruel, there was nothing left for her but to quit the village, and go to some distant relations in France. She would wait, she added, till the new moon shone in the sky, and then she must go, for she could no longer endure the insinuations which were circulated about her. Lest there should be any mistake she enclosed a copy of a note she had sent to the other gentleman, telling him that she should never speak to him again. Finally, she put the address of the village in France to which she was going, and begged and prayed him to write to her.",think good give farmer doubt return say speak leave arbour twist ribbon letter begg throw locket brook believe miserable life refuse speak stay while endeavour obtain access remain cruel be leave quit village go distant relation wait add new moon shine sky go endure insinuation circulate mistake enclose copy note send other gentleman tell speak put address village go begg pray write 
56,"When the poor old man had read these words, and saw that after all the playful magpie must have taken the glittering locket and placed it, not in his nest, but a chink of the tree; when he learned that all these years and years the girl he had so dearly loved must have been waiting with aching heart for a letter of forgiveness from him, the orchard swam round, as it were, before his eyes, he heard a rushing sound like a waterfall in his ears, the returning light of the sun went out again, and he fainted. Had it not been for the young gentleman, who caught him, he would have fallen to the ground, and it was just at this moment that Bevis and his papa arrived at the spot.",poor old man read word see playful magpie take glitter locket place nest chink tree learn year year girl love wait ach heart letter forgiveness orchard swim eye hear rush sound waterfall ear return light sun go faint young gentleman catch fall ground moment papa arrive spot
