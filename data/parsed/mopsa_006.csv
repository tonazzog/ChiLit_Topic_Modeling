5," Soon after sunrise they came to a great city, and it was perfectly still. There were grand towers and terraces, wharves, too, and a large market, but there was nobody anywhere to be seen. Jack thought that might be because it was so early in the morning; and when the boat ran itself up against a wooden wharf and stopped, he jumped ashore, for he thought this must be the end of his journey. A delightful town it was, if only there had been any people in it! The market-place was full of stalls, on which were spread toys, baskets, fruit, butter, vegetables, and all the other things that are usually sold in a market.",sunrise come great city be grand tower terrace wharve large market be see think early morning boat run wooden wharf stop jump think end journey delightful town be person market place full stall spread toy basket fruit butter vegetable other thing sell market 
6,"Jack walked about in it. Then he looked in at the open doors of the houses, and at last, finding that they were all empty, he walked into one, looked at the rooms, examined the picture-books, rang the bells, and set the musical-boxes going. Then, after he had shouted a good deal, and tried in vain to make some one hear, he went back to the edge of the river where his boat was lying, and the water was so delightfully clear and calm, that he thought he would bathe. So he took off his clothes, and folding them very carefully, so as not to hurt the fairies, laid them down beside a hay-cock, and went in, and ran about and paddled for a long time,--much longer than there was any occasion for; but then he had nothing to do.",walk look open door house last find empty walk look room examine picture book ring bell set musical box go shout good deal try vain make one hear go edge river boat lie water clear calm think bathe take clothes fold hurt fairy lay hay cock go run paddle long time be occasion have do 
7,"When at last he had finished, he ran to the hay-cock and began to dress himself; but he could not find his stockings, and after looking about for some time he was obliged to put on his clothes without them, and he was going to put his boots on his bare feet, when, walking to the other side of the hay-cock, he saw a little old woman about as large as himself. She had a pair of spectacles on, and she was knitting.",last finish run hay cock begin dress find stocking look time oblige put clothes go put boot bare foot walk other side hay cock see little old woman large have pair spectacle knitting 
8,She looked so sweet-tempered that Jack asked her if she knew anything about his stockings.,look sweet temper ask know stocking

14,"""Yes,"" said Jack, ""of course you are.""",say course 
15,"""And as I am pleased with you for being honest,"" continued the little woman, ""I shall give you some breakfast out of my basket."" So she took out a saucer full of honey, a roll of bread, and a cup of milk.",pleased honest continue little woman give breakfast basket take saucer full honey roll bread cup milk 
16,"""Thank you,"" said Jack, ""but I am not a beggar-boy; I have got a half-crown, a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence; so I can buy this breakfast of you, if you like. You look very poor.""",thank say beggar boy get half crown shilling sixpence pence buy breakfast like look poor 
17,"""Do I?"" said the little woman, softly; and she went on knitting, and Jack began to eat the breakfast.",say little woman go knitting begin eat breakfast 
18,"""I wonder what has become of my stockings,"" said Jack.",wonder become stocking say 
19,"""You will never see them any more,"" said the old woman. ""I threw them into the river, and they floated away.""",see more say old woman throw river float 
20,"""Why did you?"" asked Jack.",ask 
21,"The little woman took no notice; but presently she had finished a beautiful pair of stockings, and she handed them to Jack, and said,--",little woman take notice finish beautiful pair stocking hand say 
22,"""Is that like the pair you lost?""",pair lose 
23,"""Oh no,"" said Jack; ""these are much more beautiful stockings than mine.""",say beautiful stocking 
24,"""Do you like them as well?"" asked the fairy woman.",like ask fairy woman 
25,"""I like them much better,"" said Jack, putting them on. ""How clever you are!""",like good say put clever 
26,"""Would you like to wear these,"" said the woman, ""instead of yours?""",like wear say woman 
27,"She gave Jack such a strange look when she said this, that he was afraid to take them, and answered,--",give strange look say afraid take answer 
28,"""I shouldn't like to wear them if you think I had better not.""",like wear think have good 
29,"""Well,"" she answered, ""I am very honest, as I told you; and therefore I am obliged to say that if I were you I would not wear those stockings on any account.""",answer honest tell oblige say wear stocking account 
30,"""Why not?"" said Jack; for she looked so sweet-tempered that he could not help trusting her.",say look sweet temper help trust 
31,"""Why not?"" repeated the fairy; ""why, because when you have those stockings on, your feet belong to me.""",repeat fairy have stocking foot belong 
32,"""Oh!"" said Jack. ""Well, if you think that matters, I'll take them off again. Do you think it matters?""",say think matter take think matter 
33,"""Yes,"" said the fairy woman; ""it matters, because I am a slave, and my master can make me do whatever he pleases, for I am completely in his power. So, if he found out that I had knitted these stockings for you, he would make me order you to walk into his mill,--the mill which grinds the corn for the town; and there you would have to grind and grind till I got free again.""",say fairy woman matter slave master make do please power find knite stocking make order walk mill mill grind corn town have grind grind get free 
34,"When Jack heard this, he pulled off the beautiful stockings, and laid them on the old woman's lap. Upon this she burst out crying, as if her heart would break.",hear pull beautiful stocking lay old woman lap burst cry heart break 
35,"""If my fairies that I have in my pocket would only wake,"" said Jack, ""I would fight your master; for if he is no bigger than you are, perhaps I could beat him, and get you away.""",fairy pocket wake say fight master big beat get 
36,"""No, Jack,"" said the little woman; ""that would be of no use. The only thing you could do would be to buy me; for my cruel master has said that if ever I am late again he shall sell me in the slave market to the brown people, who work underground. And, though I am dreadfully afraid of my master, I mean to be late to-day, in hopes (as you are kind, and as you have some money) that you will come to the slave-market and buy me. Can you buy me, Jack, to be your slave?""",say little woman use only thing do buy cruel master say late sell slave market brown person work afraid master mean late day hope kind have money come slave market buy buy slave 
37,"""I don't want a slave,"" said Jack; ""and, besides, I have hardly any money to buy you with.""",want slave say have money buy 
38,"""But it is real money,"" said the fairy woman, ""not like what my master has. His money has to be made every week, for if there comes a hot day it cracks, so it never has time to look old, as your half-crown does; and that is how we know the real money, for we cannot imitate anything that is old. Oh, now, now it is twelve o'clock! now I am late again! and though I said I would do it, I am so frightened!""",real money say fairy woman master have money have make week come hot day crack have time look old half crown know real money imitate old o'clock late say do frighten 
39,"So saying, the little woman ran off towards the town, wringing her hands, and Jack ran beside her.",say little woman run town wring hand run 
40,"""How am I to find your master?"" he said.",find master say 
41,"""O Jack, buy me! buy me!"" cried the fairy woman. ""You will find me in the slave-market. Bid high for me. Go back and put your boots on, and bid high.""",buy buy cry fairy woman find slave market be high go put boot bid high 
42,"Now Jack had nothing on his feet, so he left the poor little woman to run into the town by herself, and went back to put his boots on. They were very uncomfortable, as he had no stockings; but he did not much mind that, and he counted his money. There was the half-crown that his grandmamma had given him on his birthday, there was a shilling, a sixpence, and two pence, besides a silver fourpenny-piece which he had forgotten. He then marched into the town; and now it was quite full of people,--all of them little men and women about his own height. They thought he was somebody of consequence, and they called out to him to buy their goods. And he bought some stockings, and said, ""What I want to buy now is a slave.""",have foot leave poor little woman run town go put boot uncomfortable have stocking mind count money be half crown grandmamma give birthday be shilling sixpence pence silver fourpenny piece forget march town full person little man woman own height think consequence call buy goods buy stocking say want buy slave 
43,"So they showed him the way to the slave-market, and there whole rows of odd-looking little people were sitting, while in front of them stood the slaves.",show way slave market whole row odd look little person sit front stand slave 
44,"Now Jack had observed as he came along how very disrespectful the dogs of that town were to the people. They had a habit of going up to them and smelling at their legs, and even gnawing their feet as they sat before the little tables selling their wares; and what made this more surprising was that the people did not always seem to find out when they were being gnawed. But the moment the dogs saw Jack they came and fawned on him, and two old hounds followed him all the way to the slave-market; and when he took a seat one of them laid down at his feet, and said, ""Master, set your handsome feet on my back, that they may be out of the dust.""",observe come disrespectful dog town person have habit go smell leg gnaw foot sit little table sell ware make surprising person seem find gnaw moment dog see come fawn old hound follow way slave market take seat lay foot say master set handsome foot back dust 
45,"""Don't be afraid of him,"" said the other hound; ""he won't gnaw your feet. He knows well enough that they are real ones.""",afraid say other hound gnaw foot know real one 
46,"""Are the other people's feet not real?"" asked Jack.",other person foot real ask 
47,"""Of course not,"" said the hound. ""They had a feud long ago with the fairies, and they all went one night into a great corn-field which belonged to these enemies of theirs, intending to steal the corn. So they made themselves invisible, as they are always obliged to do till twelve o'clock at noon; but before morning dawn, the wheat being quite ripe, down came the fairies with their sickles, surrounded the field, and cut the corn. So all their legs of course got cut off with it, for when they are invisible they cannot stir. Ever since that they have been obliged to make their legs of wood.""",course say hound have feud fairy go night great corn-field belong enemy intend steal corn make invisible oblige do o'clock noon morning dawn wheat ripe come fairy sickle surround field cut corn leg course cut invisible stir oblige make leg wood 
48,"While the hound was telling this story Jack looked about, but he did not see one slave who was in the least like his poor little friend, and he was beginning to be afraid that he should not find her, when he heard two people talking together.",hound tell story look see slave least poor little friend begin afraid find hear person talk 
49,"""Good-day!"" said one. ""So you have sold that good-for-nothing slave of yours?""",good day say sell good slave 
50,"""Yes,"" answered a very cross-looking old man. ""She was late again this morning, and came to me crying and praying to be forgiven; but I was determined to make an example of her, so I sold her at once to Clink-of-the-Hole, and he has just driven her away to work in his mine.""",answer cross -look old man late morning come cry pray forgive determined make example sell drive work 
51,"Jack, on hearing this, whispered to the hound at his feet, ""If you will guide me to Clink's hole, you shall be my dog.""",hear whisper hound foot guide hole dog 
52,"""Master, I will do my best,"" answered the hound; and he stole softly out of the market, Jack following him.",master do good answer hound steal market follow
