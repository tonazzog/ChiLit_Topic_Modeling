6,"“Yes, I came away directly after collections. How are you, Margaret?”",come collection 
7,"“Pretty brave, thank you;” but the brother and sister both read on each other’s features that the additional three months of suspense had told. There were traces of toil and study on Norman’s brow; the sunken look about his eyes, and the dejected outline of his cheek, Margaret knew betokened discouragement; and though her mild serenity was not changed, she was almost transparently thin and pale. They had long ago left off asking whether there were tidings, and seldom was the subject adverted to, though the whole family seemed to be living beneath a dark shadow.",brave thank brother sister read other feature additional month suspense tell be trace toil study brow sink look eye dejected outline cheek know betoken discouragement mild serenity change thin pale leave ask be tiding subject advert whole family seem live dark shadow

10,“And the little lady prospers?”,little lady prosper 
11,"“Capitally, though I get rather contradictory reports of her. First, papa declared her something surpassing--exactly like Flora, and so I suppose she is; but Ethel and Meta will say nothing for her beauty, and Blanche calls her a fright. But papa is her devoted admirer--he does so enjoy having a sort of property again in a baby!”",get contradictory report declare surpass suppose say beauty call fright devoted admirer enjoy have sort property baby

19,"“Quickly, I fancy. Dr. Spencer, who knows all kinds of news (papa says he makes a scientific study of gossip, as a new branch of comparative anatomy), found out from the Clevelands that Mr. Esdaile meant to retire, and happened to mention it the last time that Flora came to see me. It was like firing a train. You would have wondered to see how it excited her, who usually shows her feelings so little. She has been so much occupied with it, and so anxious that George should be ready to take the field at once, that papa was afraid of its hurting her, and Ethel comes home declaring that the election is more to her than her baby.”",fancy know kind news papa say make scientific study gossip new branch comparative anatomy find mean retire happen mention last time come see fire train wonder see excite show feeling little occupy anxious ready take field papa afraid hurt come declare election more baby

26,“Has Meta been comfortable?”,comfortable 
27,"“Dear little thing! Every one says how beautifully she has behaved. She brought all her housekeeping books to Flora at once, and only begged to be made helpful in whatever way might be most convenient. She explained, what we never knew before, how she had the young maids in to read with her, and asked leave to go on. Very few could have been set aside so simply and sweetly in their own house.”",dear little thing one say behave bring housekeeping book begg make helpful way convenient explain know have young maid read ask leave go few set own house

29,"“Oh, yes. She took the management of course, but Meta is charmed with her having the girls in from the village, in turn, to help in the scullery. They have begun family prayers too, and George makes the stablemen go to church--a matter which had been past Meta, as you may guess, though she had been a wonderful little manager, and Flora owned herself quite astonished.”",take management course charm have girl village turn help scullery begin family prayer make stablemen go church matter guess wonderful little manager own astonished 
30,“I wonder only at her being astonished.”,wonder astonished 
31,"“Meta owned to Ethel that what had been worst of all to her was the heart sinking, at finding herself able to choose her occupations, with no one to accommodate them to. But she would not give way--she set up more work for herself at the school, and has been talking of giving singing lessons at Cocksmoor; and she forced herself to read, though it was an effort. She has been very happy lately in nursing Flora.”",own bad heart sinking find able choose occupation accommodate give way set more work school talk give sing lesson force read effort happy nurse

38,"Norman was soon at Abbotstoke; and, as he drew his rein, Meta’s bright face nodded to him from Flora’s sitting-room window; and, as he passed the conservatory, the little person met him, with a summons, at once, to his sister.",draw rein bright face nod sitting room window pass conservatory little person meet summons sister

43,“No; but Margaret said he had been with her.”,say

47,"“It is the very moment when men of principle are most wanted,” said Norman. “The questions of the day are no light matters; and it is an immense point to save Stoneborough from being represented by one of the Tomkins’ set.”",very moment man principle want say question day light matter immense point save represent set 
48,"“Exactly so,” said Flora. “I should feel it a crime to say one word to deter George, at a time when every effort must be made to support the right cause. One must make sacrifices when the highest interests are at stake.”",say feel crime say word deter time effort make support right cause make sacrifice high interest stake 
49,"Flora seemed to thrive upon her sacrifice--she had never appeared more brilliant and joyous. Her brother saw, in her, a Roman matron; and the ambition that was inherent in his nature, began to find compensation for being crushed, as far as regarded himself, by soaring for another. He eagerly answered that he fully agreed with her, and that she would never repent urging her husband to take on himself the duties incumbent on all who had the power.",seem thrive sacrifice appear brilliant joyous brother see roman matron ambition inherent nature begin find compensation crush regard soar answer agree repent urge husband take duty incumbent have power 
50,"Highly gratified, she asked him to look at a copy of George’s intended address, which was lying on the table. He approved of the tenor, but saw a few phrases susceptible of a better point. “Give it,” she said, putting a pen into his hand; and he began to interline and erase her fair manuscript, talking earnestly, and working up himself and the address at the same time, till it had grown into a composition far superior to the merely sensible affair it had been. Eloquence and thought were now in the language, and substance--and Flora was delighted.",gratified ask look copy intend address lie table approve tenor see few phrase susceptible good point give say put pen hand begin interline erase fair manuscript talk work address same time grow composition superior sensible affair eloquence thought language substance delighted

52,"“I do not mean to inflict her mercilessly on her relations,” said Flora, “but I should like you to see her. She is so like Blanche.”",mean inflict relation say like see 
53,"The little girl was brought in, and Flora made a very pretty young mother, as she held her in her arms, with so much graceful pride. Norman was perfectly entranced--he had never seen his sister so charming or so admirable, between her delight in her infant, and her self-devotion to the good of her husband and her country--acting so wisely, and speaking so considerately; and praising her dear Meta with so much warmth. He would never have torn himself away, had not the nurse hinted that Mrs. Rivers had had too much excitement and fatigue already to-day; and, besides, he suspected that he might find Meta in the drawing-room, where he might discuss the whole with her, and judge for himself of her state of spirits.",little girl bring make young mother hold arm much graceful pride entrance see sister charming admirable delight infant self devotion good husband country act speak prais dear much warmth tear nurse hint river have much excitement fatigue day suspect find draw room discuss whole judge state spirit 
54,"Flora’s next visitor was her father, who came as the twilight was enhancing the comfortable red brightness of the fire. He was very happy in these visits--mother and child had both prospered so well, and it was quite a treat to be able to expend his tenderness on Flora. His little grandchild seemed to renew his own happy days, and he delighted to take her from her mother and fondle her. No sooner was the baby in his arms than Flora’s hands were busy among the papers, and she begged him to ring for lights.",next visitor father come twilight enhance comfortable red brightness fire happy visit mother child prosper treat able expend tenderness little grandchild seem renew own happy day delight take mother fondle baby arm hand busy paper begg ring light

57,"“Let me see,” said Dr. May, holding out his hand for it.",let see say hold hand 
58,"“This is a rough copy, too much scratched for you to make out.”",rough copy scratch make 
59,"She read it accordingly, and her father admired it exceedingly--Norman’s touches, above all; and Flora’s reading had dovetailed all so neatly together that no one knew where the joins were. “I will copy it fairly,”  she said, “if you will show it to Dr. Spencer, and ask whether he thinks it too strong. Mr. Dodsley too; he would be more gratified if he saw it first, in private, and thought himself consulted.”",read father admire touch reading dovetail know join copy say show ask think strong gratified see private think consult

70,"She looked very much hurt, and turned away her head.",look hurt turn head

75,"“I can say no more, except to beg him not to let you exert yourself.”",say more beg let exert 
76,"Accordingly, when George came home, the doctor read him a lecture on his wife’s over-busy brain; and was listened to, as usual, with gratitude and deference. He professed that he only wished to do what was best for her, but she never would spare herself; and, going to her side, with his heavy, fond solicitude, he made her promise not to hurt herself, and she laughed and consented.",come doctor read lecture wife busy brain listen usual gratitude deference profess wish do good spare go side heavy fond solicitude make promise hurt laugh consent 
77,"The promise was easily given, for she did not believe she was hurting herself; and, as to giving up the election, or ceasing secretly to prompt George, that was absolutely out of the question. What could be a greater duty than to incite her husband to usefulness?",promise give believe hurt give election cease prompt question great duty incite husband usefulness 
78,"Moreover it was but proper to invite Meta’s aunt and cousin to see her, and to project a few select dinners for their amusement and the gratification of her neighbours. It was only grateful and cousinly likewise, to ask the “Master of Glenbracken”; and as she saw the thrill of colour on Ethel’s cheeks, at the sight of the address to the Honourable Norman Ogilvie, she thought herself the best of sisters. She even talked of Ogilvie as a second Christian name, but Meta observed that old Aunt Dorothy would call it Leonorar Rogilvie Rivers, and thus averted it, somewhat to Ethel’s satisfaction.",proper invite aunt cousin see project few select dinner amusement gratification neighbour grateful cousinly ask see thrill colour cheek sight address honourable think good sister talk second christian name observe old call avert satisfaction 
79,"Ethel scolded herself many times for wondering whether Mr. Ogilvie would come. What was it to her? Suppose he should; suppose the rest. What a predicament! How unreasonable and conceited, even to think of such a thing, when her mind was made up. What could result, save tossings to and fro, a passing gratification set against infinite pain, and strife with her own heart and with her father’s unselfishness! Had he but come before Flora’s marriage! No; Ethel hated herself for the wish that arose for the moment. Far better he should keep away, if, perhaps, without the slightest inclination towards her, his mere name could stir up such a tumult--all, it might be, founded in vanity. Rebellious feelings and sense of tedium had once been subdued--why should they be roused again?",scold many time wonder come suppose suppose rest predicament unreasonable conceited think thing mind make result save tossing for pass gratification set infinite pain strife own heart father unselfishness come marriage hate wish arise moment good keep slight inclination mere name stir tumult found vanity rebellious feeling sense tedium subdued rouse 
80,"The answer came. Norman Ogilvie was setting off for Italy, and regretted that he could not take Abbotstoke on his way. He desired his kind remembrances and warm Christmas wishes to all his cousins.",answer come set regret take way desire kind remembrance warm wish cousin 
81,"If Ethel breathed more freely, there was a sense that tranquillity is uninteresting. It was, it must be confessed, a flat end to a romance, that all the permanent present effect was a certain softening, and a degree more attention to her appearance; and after all, this might, as Flora averred, be ascribed to the Paris outfit having taught her to wear clothes; as well as to that which had awakened the feminine element, and removed that sense of not being like other women, which sometimes hangs painfully about girls who have learned to think themselves plain or awkward.",breathe be sense tranquillity uninteresting confess flat end romance permanent present effect certain softening degree more attention appearance averr ascribe outfit teach wear clothes awaken feminine element remove sense other woman hang girl learn think plain awkward 
82,"There were other causes why it should be a dreary winter to Ethel, under the anxiety that strengthened by duration, and the strain of acting cheerfulness for Margaret’s sake. Even Mary was a care. Her round rosy childhood had worn into height and sallowness, and her languor and indifference fretted Miss Bracy, and was hunted down by Ethel, till Margaret convinced her that it was a case for patience and tenderness, which, thenceforth, she heartily gave, even encountering a scene with Miss Bracy, who was much injured by the suggestion that Mary was oppressed by perspective. Poor Mary, no one guessed the tears nightly shed over Harry’s photograph.",be other cause dreary winter anxiety strengthen duration strain acting cheerfulness sake care round rosy childhood wear height sallowness languor indifference fret hunt convince case patience tenderness thenceforth give encounter scene injure suggestion oppress perspective poor guess tear shed photograph 
83,"Nor could Ethel quite fathom Norman. He wore the dispirited, burdened expression that she knew too well, but he would not, as formerly, seek relief in confidence to her, shunning the being alone with her, and far too much occupied to offer to walk to Cocksmoor. When the intelligence came that good old Mr. Wilmot of Settlesham had peacefully gone to his rest, after a short and painless illness, Tom was a good deal affected, in his peculiar silent and ungracious fashion; but Norman did not seek to talk over the event, and the feelings he had entertained two years ago--he avoided the subject, and threw himself into the election matters with an excitement foreign to his nature.",fathom wear dispirited burden expression know seek relief confidence shunn alone occupy offer walk intelligence come good old go rest short painless illness good deal affect peculiar silent ungracious fashion seek talk event feeling entertain year avoid subject throw election matter excitement foreign nature 
84,"He was almost always at Abbotstoke, or attending George Rivers at the committee-room at the Swan, talking, writing, or consulting, concocting squibs, and perpetrating bons mots, that were the delight of friends and the confusion of foes. Flora was delighted, George adored him, Meta’s eyes danced whenever he came near, Dr. Spencer admired him, and Dr. Hoxton prophesied great things of him; but Ethel did not feel as if he were the veritable Norman, and had an undefined sensation of discomfort, when she heard his brilliant repartees, and the laughter with which he accompanied them, so unlike his natural rare and noiseless laugh. She knew it was false excitement, to drive away the suspense that none dared to avow, but which did not press on them the less heavily for being endured in silence. Indeed, Dr. May could not help now and then giving way to outbursts of despondency, of which his friend, Dr. Spencer, who made it his special charge to try to lighten his troubles, was usually the kind recipient.",attend committee room talk write consulting concoct squib perpetrate bon mot delight friend confusion foe delight adore eye dance come admire prophesy great thing feel veritable have undefined sensation discomfort hear brilliant repartee laughter accompany natural rare noiseless laugh know false excitement drive suspense dare avow press endure silence help give way outburst despondency friend make special charge try lighten trouble kind recipient 
85,"And though the bustle of the election was incongruous, and seemed to make the leaden weight the more heavy, there was a compensation in the tone of feeling that it elicited, which gave real and heartfelt pleasure.",bustle election incongruous seem make leaden weight heavy be compensation tone feeling elicite give real heartfelt pleasure 
86,"Dr. May had undergone numerous fluctuations of popularity. He had always been the same man, excellent in intention, though hasty in action, and heeding neither praise nor censure; and while the main tenor of his course never varied, making many deviations by flying to the reverse of the wrong, most immediately before him, still his personal character gained esteem every year; and though sometimes his merits, and sometimes his failings, gave violent umbrage, he had steadily risen in the estimation of his fellow-townsmen, as much as his own inconsistencies and theirs would allow, and every now and then was the favourite with all, save with the few who abused him for tyranny, because he prevented them from tyrannising.",undergone numerous fluctuation popularity same man excellent intention hasty action heed praise censure main tenor course vary make many deviation fly reverse wrong personal character gain esteem year merit failing give violent umbrage rise estimation fellow townsmen much own inconsistencyncy allow favourite save few abuse tyranny prevent tyrannise 
87,"He was just now on the top of the wave, and his son-in-law had nothing to do but to float in on the tide of his favour. The opposite faction attempted a contest, but only rendered the triumph more complete, and gave the gentlemen the pleasure of canvassing, and hearing, times without number, that the constituents only wished the candidate were Dr. May himself. His sons and daughters were full of exultation--Dr. Spencer, much struck, rallied “Dick” on his influence--and Dr. May, the drops of warm emotion trembling on his eyelashes, smiled, and bade his friend see him making a church-rate.",top wave son law have do float tide favour opposite faction attempt contest render triumph complete give gentleman pleasure canvass hear time number constituent wish candidate son daughter full exultation strike rally influence drop warm emotion tremble eyelashe smile bid friend see make church rate 
88,"The addresses and letters that came from the Grange were so admirable, that Dr. May often embraced Norman’s steady opinion that George was a very wise man. If Norman was unconscious how much he contributed to these compositions, he knew far less how much was Flora’s. In his ardour, he crammed them both, and conducted George when Flora could not be at his side. George himself was a personable man, wrote a good bold hand, would do as he was desired, and was not easily put out of countenance; he seldom committed himself by talking; and when a speech was required, was brief, and to the purpose. He made a very good figure, and in the glory of victory, Ethel herself began to grow proud of him, and the children’s great object in life was to make the jackdaws cry, “Rivers for ever!”",address letter come admirable embrace steady opinion wise man unconscious much contribute composition know less much ardour cramm conduct side personable man write good bold hand do desire put countenance commit talk speech require brief purpose make good figure glory victory begin grow proud child great object life make jackdaw cry river 
89,"Flora had always declared that she would be at Stoneborough for the nomination. No one believed her, until three days before, she presented herself and her daughter before the astonished Margaret, who was too much delighted to be able to scold. She had come away on her own responsibility, and was full of triumph. To come home in this manner, after having read “Rivers for ever!” on all the dead walls, might be called that for which she had lived. She made no stay--she had only come to show her child, and establish a precedent for driving out, and Margaret had begun to believe the apparition a dream, when the others came in, some from Cocksmoor, others from the committee-room at the Swan.",declare nomination believe day present daughter astonished delighted able scold come own responsibility full triumph come manner read dead wall call live make stay come show child establish precedent drive begin believe apparition dream other come other committee room 
90,"“So she brought the baby,” exclaimed Ethel. “I should have thought she would not have taken her out before her christening.”",bring baby exclaim think take christening 
91,"“Ethel,” said Dr. Spencer, “permit me to make a suggestion. When relations live in the same neighbourhood, there is no phrase to be more avoided than ‘I should have thought--’”",say permit make suggestion relation live same neighbourhood be phrase avoid think 
92,"The nomination-day brought Flora, Meta, baby and all to be very quiet, as was said; but how could that be? when every boy in the house was frantic, and the men scarcely less so. Aubrey and Gertrude, and the two jackdaws, each had a huge blue and orange rosette, and the two former went about roaring “Rivers for ever!” without the least consideration for the baby, who would have been decked in the same manner, if Ethel would have heard of it without indignation, at her wearing any colour before her christening white; as to Jack and Jill, though they could say their lesson, they were too much distressed by their ornaments to do ought but lurk in corners, and strive to peck them off.",nomination day bring baby quiet say boy house frantic man jackdaw have huge blue orange rosette former go roar least consideration baby deck same manner hear indignation wear colour christening white say lesson distress ornament do ought lurk corner strive peck 
93,"Flora comported herself in her usual quiet way, and tried to talk of other things, though a carnation spot in each cheek showed her anxiety and excitement. She went with her sisters to look out from Dr. Spencer’s windows towards the Town Hall. Her husband gave her his arm as they went down the garden, and Ethel saw her talking earnestly to him, and pressing his arm with her other hand to enforce her words, but if she did tutor him, it was hardly visible, and he was very glad of whatever counsel she gave.",comport usual quiet way try talk other thing carnation spot cheek show anxiety excitement go sister look window husband give arm go garden see talk press arm other hand enforce word tutor visible glad counsel give 
94,"She spoke not a word after the ladies were left with Aubrey, who was in despair at not being allowed to follow Hector and Tom, but was left, as his prematurely classical mind expressed it, like the Gaulish women with the impedimenta in the marshes--whereas Tom had added insult to injury, by a farewell to “Jack among the maidens.”",speak word lady leave despair allow follow leave classical mind express gaulish woman impedimenta marsh add insult injury farewell maiden 
95,"Meta tried to console him, by persuading him that he was their protector, and he began to think there was need of a guard, when a mighty cheer caused him to take refuge behind Ethel. Even when assured that it was anything but terrific, he gravely declared that he thought Margaret would want him, but he could not cross the garden without Meta to protect him.",try console persuade protector begin think be need guard mighty cheer cause take refuge assure terrific declare think want cross garden protect 
96,"She would not allow any one else to relieve her from the doughty champion, and thereby she missed the spectacle. It might be that she did not regret it, for though it would have been unkind to refuse to come in with her brother and sister, her wound was still too fresh for crowds, turmoil, and noisy rejoicing to be congenial. She did not withdraw her hand, which Aubrey squeezed harder at each resounding shout, nor object to his conducting her to see his museum in the dark corner of the attics, most remote from the tumult.",allow one else relieve doughty champion miss spectacle regret unkind refuse come brother sister wound fresh crowd turmoil noisy rejoicing congenial withdraw hand squeeze hard resounding shout object conduct see museum dark corner attic remote tumult 
97,"The loss was not great. The others could hear nothing distinctly, and see only a wilderness of heads; but the triumph was complete. Dr. May had been cheered enough to satisfy even Hector; George Rivers had made a very fair speech, and hurrahs had covered all deficiencies; Hector had shouted till he was as hoarse as the jackdaws; the opposite candidate had never come forward at all; Tomkins was hiding his diminished head; and the gentlemen had nothing to report but success, and were in the highest spirits.",loss great other hear see wilderness head triumph complete cheer satisfy make fair speech hurrah cover deficiency shout hoarse jackdaw opposite candidate come hide diminish head gentleman have report success high spirit 
98,"By and by Blanche was missing, and Ethel, going in quest of her, spied a hem of blue merino peeping out under all the cloaks in the hall cupboard, and found the poor little girl sobbing in such distress, that it was long before any explanation could be extracted, but at last it was revealed--when the door had been shut, and they stood in the dark, half stifled among the cloaks, that George’s spirits had taken his old facetious style with Blanche, and in the very hearing of Hector! The misery of such jokes to a sensitive child, conscious of not comprehending their scope, is incalculable, and Blanche having been a baby-coquette, was the more susceptible. She hid her face again from the very sound of her own confession, and resisted Ethel’s attempts to draw her out of the musty cupboard, declaring that she could never see either of them again. Ethel, in vain, assured her that George was gone to the dinner at the Swan; nothing was effectual but being told that for her to notice what had passed was the sure way to call Hector’s attention thereto, when she bridled, emerged, and begged to know whether she looked as if she had been crying. Poor child, she could never again be unconscious, but, at least, she was rendered peculiarly afraid of a style of notice, that might otherwise have been a temptation.",miss go quest spy hem blue merino peep cloak hall cupboard find poor little girl sobb such distress long explanation extract last reveal door shut stand dark half stifle cloak spirit take old facetious style very hearing misery such joke sensitive child conscious comprehend scope incalculable baby coquette susceptible hide face very sound own confession resist attempt draw musty cupboard declare see vain assure go dinner effectual tell notice pass sure way call attention bridl emerge begg know look cry poor child unconscious least render afraid style notice temptation 
99,"Ethel privately begged Flora to hint to George to alter his style of wit, and the suggestion was received better than the blundering manner deserved; Flora was too exulting to take offence, and her patronage of all the world was as full-blown as her ladylike nature allowed. Ethel, she did not attempt to patronise, but she promised all the sights in London to the children, and masters to Mary and Blanche, and she perfectly overwhelmed Miss Bracy with orphan asylums for her sisters. She would have liked nothing better than dispersing cards, with Mrs. Rivers prominent among the recommenders of the case.",begg hint alter style wit suggestion receive good blunder manner deserve exult take offence patronage world full blow ladylike nature allow attempt patronise promise sight child master overwhelm orphan asylum sister like good disperse card prominent recommender case

101,"“Excelsior?” said Ethel, and Flora smiled, well pleased, but she had not caught half the meaning. “May it be the right excelsior” added Ethel, in a low voice that no one heard, and she was glad they did not. They were all triumphant, and she could not tell why she had a sense of sadness, and thought of Flora’s story long ago, of the girl who ascended Mont Blanc, and for what?",say smile pleased catch meaning right excelsior add low voice hear glad triumphant tell have sense sadness think story girl ascend 
102,"All she had to do at present was to listen to Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the intended kindness to her sister.",have do present listen sure think improve afraid ungrateful intend kindness sister 
103,"Ethel had more sympathy here, for she had thought that Flora was giving herself airs, and she laughed and said her sister was pleased to be in a position to help her friends; and tried to turn it off, but ended by stumbling into allowing that prosperity was apt to make people over-lavish of offers of kindness.",have more sympathy think give air laugh say sister pleased position help friend try turn end stumble allow prosperity apt make person lavish offer kindness

108,"“Yes, I can, when it is sense; but please don’t treat me like a heroine. I am sure there is quite enough in the world that is worrying, without picking shades of manner to pieces.

110,"She had learned that, to be rough and merry, was the best way of doing Miss Bracy good in the end; and so she often gave herself the present pain of knowing that she was being supposed careless and hard-hearted; but the violent affection for her proved that the feeling did not last.",learn rough merry good way do good end give present pain know suppose careless hard hearted violent affection prove feeling last

112,"It was the first time that she had seen much of her little niece. She was no great baby-handler, nor had she any of the phrases adapted to the infant mind; but that pretty little serene blue-eyed girl had been her chief thought all day, and she was abashed by recollecting how little she had dwelt on her own duties as her sponsor, in the agitations excited by the doubts about her coadjutor.",first time see much little niece great baby handler have phrase adapt infant mind little serene blue eyed girl chief thought day abash recollect little dwele own duty sponsor agitation excite doubt coadjutor 
113,"She took out her Prayer-book, and read the Service for Baptism, recollecting the thoughts that had accompanied her youngest sister’s orphaned christening, “The vain pomp and glory of the world, and all covetous desires of the same.” They seemed far enough off then, and now--poor little Leonora!",take prayer book read recollect thought accompany young sister orphan christening vain pomp glory world covetous desire same seem poor little 
114,"Ethel knew that she judged her sister hardly; yet she could not help picturing to herself the future--a young lady, trained for fashionable life, serious teaching not omitted, but right made the means of rising in the world; taught to strive secretly, but not openly, for admiration--a scheming for her marriage--a career like Flora’s own. Ethel could scarcely feel that it would not be a mockery to declare, on her behalf, that she renounced the world. But, alas! where was not the world? Ethel blushed at having censured others, when, so lately, she had herself been oblivious of the higher duty. She thought of the prayer, including every Christian in holy and loving intercession--“I pray not that Thou wouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou wouldest keep them from the evil.”",know judge sister help picture future young lady train fashionable life serious teaching omit make means rise world teach strive admiration scheming marriage career own feel mockery declare behalf renounce world world blush censure other oblivious high duty think prayer include holy loving intercession pray take world keep evil

The intermixture with good is the trial, and is it not so everywhere--ever since the world and the Church have seemed fused together? But she will soon be the child of a Father who guards His own; and, at least, I can pray for her, and her dear mother.

116,"There was a happy family gathering on the New Year’s Day, and Flora, who had kindly felt her way with Meta, finding her not yet ready to enjoy a public festivity for the village, added a supplement to the Christmas beef, that a second dinner might be eaten at home, in honour of Miss Leonora Rivers.",be happy family gathering new feel way find ready enjoy public festivity village add supplement beef second dinner eat home honour 
117,"Lady Leonora was highly satisfied with her visit, which impressed her far more in favour of the Abbotstoke neighbourhood than in the days of poor old Mr. Rivers. Flora knew every one, and gave little select dinner-parties, which, by her good management, even George, at the bottom of the table, could not make heavy. Dr. Spencer enjoyed them greatly, and was an unfailing resource for conversation; and as to the Hoxtons, Flora felt herself amply repaying the kindness she had received in her young lady days, when she walked down to the dining-room with the portly headmaster, or saw his good lady sit serenely admiring the handsome rooms. “A very superior person, extremely pleasing and agreeable,” was the universal verdict on Mrs. Rivers. Lady Leonora struck up a great friendship with her, and was delighted that she meant to take Meta to London. The only fault that could be found with her was that she had so many brothers; and Flora, recollecting that her ladyship mistrusted those brothers, avoided encouraging their presence at the Grange, and took every precaution against any opening for the suspicion that she threw them in the way of her little sister-in-law.",satisfied visit impress more favour neighbourhood day poor old know one give little select dinner party good management bottom table make heavy enjoy unfailing resource conversation feel repay kindness receive young lady day walk dining room portly headmaster see good lady sit admire handsome room superior person pleasing agreeable universal verdict strike great friendship delighted mean take only fault find have many brother recollect ladyship mistrust brother avoid encourage presence take precaution opening suspicion throw way little sister law 
118,"Nor had Flora forgotten the Ladies’ Committee, or Cocksmoor. As to the muses, they gave no trouble at all. Exemplary civilities about the chair passed between the Member’s lady and Mrs. Ledwich, ending in Flora’s insisting that priority in office should prevail, feeling that she could well afford to yield the post of honour, since anywhere she was the leader. She did not know how much more conformable the ladies had been ever since they had known Dr. Spencer’s opinion; and yet he only believed that they were grateful for good advice, and went about among them, easy, good-natured, and utterly unconscious that for him sparkled Mrs. Ledwich’s bugles, and for him waved every spinster’s ribbon, from Miss Rich down to Miss Boulder.",forget muse give trouble exemplary civility chair pass lady end insist priority office prevail feel afford yield post honour leader know much more conformable lady know opinion believe grateful good advice go easy good natured unconscious sparkle bugle wave spinster ribbon 
119,"The point carried by their united influence was Charity Elwood’s being sent for six months’ finish at the Diocesan Training School; while a favourite pupil-teacher from Abbotstoke took her place at Cocksmoor. Dr. Spencer looked at the Training School, and talked Mrs. Ledwich into magnanimous forgiveness of Mrs. Elwood. Cherry dreaded the ordeal, but she was willing to do anything that was thought right, and likely to make her fitter for her office.",point carry united influence send month finish diocesan favourite pupil teacher take place look talk magnanimous forgiveness dread ordeal willing do think right likely make fitter office
