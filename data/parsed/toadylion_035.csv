1,CHAPTER XXXV. PRISSY'S COMPROMISE.,prissy compromise 
2," After the turmoil and excitement of the notably adventurous days which ended with the capture of the castle, the succeeding weeks dragged strangely. The holidays were dwindling as quickly as the last grains of sand in an hourglass, and there was an uneasy feeling in the air that the end of old and the beginning of new things were alike at hand.",turmoil excitement adventurous day end capture castle succeed week drag holiday dwindle last grain sand hourglass be uneasy feeling air end old beginning new thing alike hand 
3,"Mr. Picton Smith returned from London the day after the great battle. That afternoon he was closeted for a long time with Mr. Burnham, but not even the venturesome Sir Toady Lion on his hands and knees, could overhear what the two gentlemen had to say to each other. At all events Mr. Smith did not this time attempt to force any confession from the active combatants. His failure on a former occasion had been complete enough, and he had no desire once more to confess himself worsted by Hugh John's determination to abjure all that savoured even remotely of the ""dasht-mean.""",return day great battle afternoon closet long time venturesome hand knee overhear gentleman have say other event time attempt force confession active combatant failure former occasion complete have desire more confess worst determination abjure savoure dasht mean 
4,"But it is certain that the Smoutchy ringleaders were not further punished, and Mr. Smith took no steps to enforce the interdict which he had obtained against trespassers on the castle island.",certain ringleader punish take step enforce interdict obtain trespasser castle island 
5,"For it was about this time that Prissy, having taken a great deal of trouble to understand all the bearings of the case, at last, with a brave heart, went and knocked at her father's study door.",time take great deal trouble understand bearing case last brave heart go knock father study door

8,"""Well, little girl, what is it? What can I do for you?"" said her father, smiling upon her; for he had heard of her ambassadorial picnic to the Smoutchies, and perhaps his daughter's trustful gentleness had made him a little ashamed of his own severity.",little girl do say father smile hear ambassadorial picnic daughter trustful gentleness make little ashamed own severity 
9,"Prissy stood nerving herself to speak the words which were in her heart. She had seen Peace and kindly Concord bless her mission from afar; and now, like Paul before King Agrippa, she would not be unfaithful to the heavenly vision.",prissy stand nerve speak word heart see bless mission unfaithful heavenly vision

13,"""Of course not,"" replied her father, ""but you know, Prissy, I can't afford to keep a man down on the island to see that sixpenny trippers don't pull down my castle stone by stone, or break their own necks by falling into the dungeon.""",course reply father know afford keep man island see sixpenny tripper pull castle stone stone break own neck fall dungeon

16,"Mr. Picton Smith moved away his hand. Her mother used to do just that, and somehow the memory hurt. Nevertheless, all unconsciously, the touch of the child's hand softened him.",move hand mother use do memory hurt touch child hand soften 
17,"""No, Prissy,"" he said wonderingly, ""but what do you know about such things?""",prissy say know such thing 
18,"""Nothing at all,"" she answered, ""but I am trying to learn. I want everybody to love you, and think you as nice as I know you to be. Don't you think you could let some one you knew very well live in the little lodge by the white bridge, and keep out the horrid people, or see that they behaved themselves?""",answer try learn want love think nice know think let one know live little lodge white bridge keep horrid person see behave

24,"""Well, what is it? Go on!"" said her father, but the words were more softly spoken than you would think only to see them printed.",go say father word speak think see print 
25,"""Nobody told me about anything--I just thought about it all myself, father,"" she answered, taking courage from a certain look in Mr. Smith's eyes; ""once I heard you say that the money was what the town's-people cared about. And--and--well, I knew that Jane Housemaid wanted to get married to Tom Cannon, and you see they can't, because Tom has not enough wages to take a house.""",tell think father answer take courage certain look eye hear say money town person care know want get married see have enough wage take house 
26,"Prissy was speaking very fast now, rattling out the words so as to be finished before her father could interpose with any grown-up questions or objections.",prissy speak rattling word finish father interpose grow question objection 
27,"""And you know I remembered last night when I was lying awake that Catherine would have done this----""",know remember last night lie do 
28,"""What Catherine?"" said her father, who did not always follow his daughter's reasoning.",say father follow daughter reasoning 
29,"""Saint Catherine of Siena, of course,"" said Prissy, for whom there was no other of the name; ""so I came to you, and I want you to let Tom and Jane have the cottage, and Jane can take up the sixpences in a little brass plate like the one Mr. Burnham gets from the churchwardens on Sunday. And, oh! but I would just love to help her. May I sometimes, father?""",course say be other name come want let have cottage take sixpence little brass plate one get churchwarden love help father 
30,"""Well,"" said her father, laughing, ""there is perhaps something in what you say; but I don't think the Provost and Magistrates would ever agree. Now run away and play, and I will see what can be done.""",say father laugh be say think agree run play see do

32,"But all the same Prissy did not go and play, and it was not Mr. Picton Smith who saw what could be done. On the afternoon of the same day the Provost of the good town of Edam entered the Council Chamber wiping his face and panting vigorously. He was a stout man of much good humour when not crossed in temper, the leading chemist and druggist in the town, and as the proprietor of more houses and less education than any man in Edam, of very great influence among the councillors.",same prissy go play see do afternoon same day good town enter wipe face pant stout man much good humour cross temper lead chemist druggist town proprietor more house less education man great influence councillor 
33,"""Well, billies,"" he cried jovially, ""what do you think? There's a lass has keep'd me from the meetin' of this council for a full half-hour.""",billy cry think be lass keep meetin council full half hour 
34,"""A lass!"" answered the senior bailie, still more hilariously, ""that's surely less than proper. I will be compelled to inform Mrs. Lamont of the fact.""",lass answer senior bailie less proper compel inform fact 
35,"""Oh, it was a lassie of twelve or thirteen,"" answered the Provost. ""So none of your insinuations, Bailie Tawse, and I'll thank you. She had a most astonishing tale to tell. It appears she is Picton Smith's lassie from Windy Standard; and she says to me, says she, 'Provost, do you want to have the tourist folk that come to Edam admitted to the castle?' says she. 'Of course,' says I, 'that is what the law-plea is about. That dust is no settled yet.' 'Then,' says she, brisk as if she was hiring me at Yedam fair, 'suppose my father was willing to let ye charge a sixpence for admission, would you pay a capable man his wages summer and winter to look after it--a man that my father would approve of?' 'Aye,' says I, 'the council would be blythe and proud to do that'--me thinking of my sister's son Peter that was injured by a lamp-post falling against him last New Year's night as he was coming hame frae the Blue Bell. 'Then,' says she, 'I think it can be managed. My father will put Tom Cannon in the lodge at the white bridge. You will pay him ten shillings in the week for his wife looking after the gate and taking the parties over the castle.' 'His wife,' says I; 'Tom is no married that ever I heard.' 'No,' says she, 'but he will be very quick if he gets the lodge.' Then I thocht that somebody had put her up to all this, and I questioned her tightly. But no--certes, she is a clever lass. I verily believe if I had said the word she would hae comed along here to the council meeting and faced the pack o' ye. But I said to her that she might gang her ways hame, and that I would put the matter before the council mysel'!""",lassie answer insinuation thank have astonish tale tell appear lassie windy say say want have tourist folk come admit castle say course say law plea dust settle say brisk hire fair suppose father willing let charge sixpence admission pay capable man wage summer winter look man father approve say council blythe proud do think sister son injure lamp post fall last new night come hame frie blue say think manage father put lodge white bridge pay shilling week wife look gate take party castle wife say married hear say quick get lodge thick put question certe clever lass believe say word come council meeting face pack say gang way put matter council mysel

37,"The Provost, who had been walking up and down all the time and wiping his brow, finally plumped solidly into his chair. There was a mighty discussion--in which, as usual, many epithets were bandied about; but finally it was unanimously agreed that, if the offer were put on a firm and legal basis and the interdict withdrawn, the ""Smith's Lassie"" compromise, as it was called for brevity, might be none such a bad solution of the difficulty for all parties.",walk time wipe brow plump chair be mighty discussion usual many epithet band agree offer put firm legal basis interdict withdraw compromise call brevity bad solution difficulty party 
38,"Thus by the wise thought and brave heart of a girl was the great controversy ended. And now the tourist and holiday-maker, each after his kind, passes his sixpence into the slot of a clicking gate, instead of depositing it in the brazen offertory salver, which had been the desire of Prissy's heart.",wise thought brave heart girl great controversy end tourist holiday maker kind pass sixpence slot click gate deposit brazen offertory salver desire heart 
39,"""For,"" said one of the councillors generously, when the plate was proposed, ""how do we know that Mrs. Cannon might not keep every second sixpence for herself--or maybe send it up to Mr. Smith? We all know that she was long a servant in his house. No, no, honesty is honesty--but it's better when well looked after. Let us have a patent 'clicker.' I have used one attached to my till for years, and found it of great utility in the bacon-and-ham trade.""",say councillor plate propose know keep second sixpence send know long servant house honesty honesty good look let have patent clicker use attach till year find great utility bacon ham trade

41,"On the Sunday after this was finally arranged, Mr. Burnham gave out his text:--",arrange give text 
42,"""Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.""",bless peacemaker call child 
43,"And this is the way he ended his sermon: ""There is one here to-day whom I might without offence or flattery call a true child of God. I will not say who that is; but this I will say, that I, for one, would rather be such a peacemaker, and have a right to be called by that other name, than be general of the greatest army in the world.""",way end sermon be day offence flattery call true child say say peacemaker have right call other name general great army world 
44,"""I think he must mean the Provost--or else my father,"" said Prissy to herself, looking reverently up to where, in the front row of the upper seats, the local chief magistrate sat, mopping his head with a red spotted handkerchief, and sunning himself in the somewhat sultry beams of his own greatness.",think mean father say look front row upper seat local chief magistrate sit mopp head red spot handkerchief sun sultry beam own greatness 
45,"As for Hugh John, he declared that for a man who could row in a college boat, and who worshipped an old blue coat hung up in a glass case, Mr. Burnham said more drivelling things than any man alive or dead.",declare man row college boat worship old blue coat hang glass case say more drivelling thing man alive dead 
46,"And Toady Lion said nothing. He was only wondering all through the service whether he could catch a fly without his father seeing him.--He found that he could not. After this failure he remembered that he had a brandy ball only half sucked in his left trousers' pocket. He got it out with some difficulty. It had stuck fast to the seams, and finally came away somewhat mixed up with twine, sealing wax, and a little bit of pitch wrapped in leather. But as soon as he got down to it the brandy ball proved itself thoroughly satisfactory, and the various flavours developed in the process of sucking kept Toady Lion awake till the blessed ""Amen"" released the black-coated throng.",say wonder service catch fly father see find failure remember have brandy ball half suck left trousers pocket get difficulty stick seam come mix twine seal wax little bit pitch wrap leather get brandy ball prove satisfactory various flavour develop process sucking keep bless release black coat throng

51,"""Never mind, Toady Lion,"" he said genially, ""the truth is, I was a little tired myself to-day. I promise not to keep you quite so long next Sunday morning. You must remind me if I transgress. Nobody will, if you don't, Toady Lion.""",mind say truth little tired day promise keep next morning remind transgress
