2,"Of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through. ‘It’s something very like learning geography,’ thought Alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further. ‘Principal rivers--there ARE none. Principal mountains--I’m on the only one, but I don’t think it’s got any name. Principal towns--why, what ARE those creatures, making honey down there? They can’t be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know--’ and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, ‘just as if it was a regular bee,’ thought Alice.",course first thing do make grand survey country go travel learn geography think stand tiptoe hope able see little principal river principal mountain only one think get name principal town creature make honey bee see bee mile know time stand silent watch bustle flower poke proboscis regular bee think 
3,"However, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an elephant--as Alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath away at first. ‘And what enormous flowers they must be!’ was her next idea. ‘Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to them--and what quantities of honey they must make! I think I’ll go down and--no, I won’t JUST yet,’ she went on, checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly. ‘It’ll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away--and what fun it’ll be when they ask me how I like my walk. I shall say--“Oh, I like it well enough--“’ (here came the favourite little toss of the head), ‘“only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!”’",regular bee fact elephant find idea take breath first enormous flower next idea cottage roof take stalk put quantity honey make think go go check begin run hill try find excuse turn do go good long branch brush fun ask like walk say like come favourite little toss head dusty hot elephant tease 
4,"‘I think I’ll go down the other way,’ she said after a pause: ‘and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on. Besides, I do so want to get into the Third Square!’",think go other way say pause visit elephant want get third 
5,So with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little brooks.,excuse run hill jump first little brook

9,"‘Tickets, please!’ said the Guard, putting his head in at the window. In a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.",ticket say put head window moment hold ticket same size person seem fill carriage 
10,"‘Now then! Show your ticket, child!’ the Guard went on, looking angrily at Alice. And a great many voices all said together (‘like the chorus of a song,’ thought Alice), ‘Don’t keep him waiting, child! Why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!’",show ticket child go look great many voice say chorus song think keep wait child time worth pound minute 
11,"‘I’m afraid I haven’t got one,’ Alice said in a frightened tone: ‘there wasn’t a ticket-office where I came from.’ And again the chorus of voices went on. ‘There wasn’t room for one where she came from. The land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!’",afraid get say frighten tone be ticket office come chorus voice go be room come land worth pound inch 
12,"‘Don’t make excuses,’ said the Guard: ‘you should have bought one from the engine-driver.’ And once more the chorus of voices went on with ‘The man that drives the engine. Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!’",make excuse say buy engine driver chorus voice go man drive engine smoke worth pound puff 
13,"Alice thought to herself, ‘Then there’s no use in speaking.’ The voices didn’t join in this time, as she hadn’t spoken, but to her great surprise, they all THOUGHT in chorus (I hope you understand what THINKING IN CHORUS means--for I must confess that _I_ don’t), ‘Better say nothing at all. Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!’",think be use speak voice join time speak great surprise thought chorus hope understand thinking chorus mean confess say language worth pound word 
14,"‘I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!’ thought Alice.",dream pound tonight know think 
15,"All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscope, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said, ‘You’re travelling the wrong way,’ and shut up the window and went away.",time look telescope microscope opera glass last say travel wrong way shut window go 
16,"‘So young a child,’ said the gentleman sitting opposite to her (he was dressed in white paper), ‘ought to know which way she’s going, even if she doesn’t know her own name!’",young child say gentleman sit dress white paper ought know way go know own name 
17,"A Goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his eyes and said in a loud voice, ‘She ought to know her way to the ticket-office, even if she doesn’t know her alphabet!’",sit gentleman white shut eye say loud voice know way ticket office know alphabet 
18,"There was a Beetle sitting next to the Goat (it was a very queer carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn, HE went on with ‘She’ll have to go back from here as luggage!’",be beetle sit queer carriage full passenger rule seem speak turn go have go luggage 
19,"Alice couldn’t see who was sitting beyond the Beetle, but a hoarse voice spoke next. ‘Change engines--’ it said, and was obliged to leave off.",see sit hoarse voice speak change engine say oblige leave 
20,"‘It sounds like a horse,’ Alice thought to herself. And an extremely small voice, close to her ear, said, ‘You might make a joke on that--something about “horse” and “hoarse,” you know.’",sound horse think small voice close ear say make joke horse hoarse know 
21,"Then a very gentle voice in the distance said, ‘She must be labelled “Lass, with care,” you know--’",gentle voice distance say label lass care know 
22,"And after that other voices went on (‘What a number of people there are in the carriage!’ thought Alice), saying, ‘She must go by post, as she’s got a head on her--’ ‘She must be sent as a message by the telegraph--’ ‘She must draw the train herself the rest of the way--’ and so on.",other voice go number person carriage think say go post get head send message telegraph draw train rest way 
23,"But the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear, ‘Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return-ticket every time the train stops.’",gentleman dress white paper learn forward whisper ear mind say dear take return ticket time train stop 
24,‘Indeed I shan’t!’ Alice said rather impatiently. ‘I don’t belong to this railway journey at all--I was in a wood just now--and I wish I could get back there.’,say belong railway journey wood wish get 
25,"‘You might make a joke on THAT,’ said the little voice close to her ear: ‘something about “you WOULD if you could,” you know.’",make joke say little voice close ear know 
26,"‘Don’t tease so,’ said Alice, looking about in vain to see where the voice came from; ‘if you’re so anxious to have a joke made, why don’t you make one yourself?’",tease say look vain see voice come anxious have joke make make 
27,"The little voice sighed deeply: it was VERY unhappy, evidently, and Alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, ‘If it would only sigh like other people!’ she thought. But this was such a wonderfully small sigh, that she wouldn’t have heard it at all, if it hadn’t come QUITE close to her ear. The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature.",little voice sigh unhappy say pity comfort sigh other person think small sigh hear come close ear consequence tickle ear take thought unhappiness poor little creature 
28,"‘I know you are a friend,’ the little voice went on; ‘a dear friend, and an old friend. And you won’t hurt me, though I AM an insect.’",know friend little voice go dear friend old friend hurt insect 
29,"‘What kind of insect?’ Alice inquired a little anxiously. What she really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldn’t be quite a civil question to ask.",kind insect inquire little want know sting think civil question ask 
30,"‘What, then you don’t--’ the little voice began, when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, Alice among the rest.",little voice begin drown shrill scream engine jump alarm rest 
31,"The Horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in and said, ‘It’s only a brook we have to jump over.’ Everybody seemed satisfied with this, though Alice felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all. ‘However, it’ll take us into the Fourth Square, that’s some comfort!’ she said to herself. In another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand, which happened to be the Goat’s beard.",put head window draw say brook have jump seem satisfied feel little nervous idea train jump take fourth comfort say moment feel carriage rise air fright catch thing near hand happen beard

35,"But the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the Gnat (for that was the insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head, and fanning her with its wings.",beard seem melt touch find sit tree insect talk balancing twig head fann wing 
36,"It certainly was a VERY large Gnat: ‘about the size of a chicken,’ Alice thought. Still, she couldn’t feel nervous with it, after they had been talking together so long.",large gnat size chicken think feel nervous talk 
37,"‘--then you don’t like all insects?’ the Gnat went on, as quietly as if nothing had happened.",like insect go happen 
38,"‘I like them when they can talk,’ Alice said. ‘None of them ever talk, where _I_ come from.’",like talk say talk come 
39,"‘What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from?’ the Gnat inquired.",sort insect rejoice come inquire 
40,"‘I don’t REJOICE in insects at all,’ Alice explained, ‘because I’m rather afraid of them--at least the large kinds. But I can tell you the names of some of them.’",rejoice insect explain afraid least large kind tell name 
41,‘Of course they answer to their names?’ the Gnat remarked carelessly.,course answer name remark 
42,‘I never knew them to do it.’,know do 
43,"‘What’s the use of their having names,’ the Gnat said, ‘if they won’t answer to them?’",use have name say answer 
44,"‘No use to THEM,’ said Alice; ‘but it’s useful to the people who name them, I suppose. If not, why do things have names at all?’",use say useful person name suppose thing have name 
45,"‘I can’t say,’ the Gnat replied. ‘Further on, in the wood down there, they’ve got no names--however, go on with your list of insects: you’re wasting time.’",say reply wood get name go list insect waste time 
46,"‘Well, there’s the Horse-fly,’ Alice began, counting off the names on her fingers.",be horse fly begin count name finger 
47,"‘All right,’ said the Gnat: ‘half way up that bush, you’ll see a Rocking-horse-fly, if you look. It’s made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.’",right say half way bush see rocking horse fly look make wood get swing branch branch 
48,"‘What does it live on?’ Alice asked, with great curiosity.",live ask great curiosity 
49,"‘Sap and sawdust,’ said the Gnat. ‘Go on with the list.’",sap sawdust say go list 
50,"Alice looked up at the Rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright and sticky; and then she went on.",look horse fly great interest make mind repaint look bright sticky go 
51,‘And there’s the Dragon-fly.’,be fly 
52,"‘Look on the branch above your head,’ said the Gnat, ‘and there you’ll find a snap-dragon-fly. Its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.’",look branch head say find snap dragon fly body make plum pudding wing holly leave head raisin burn brandy 
53,‘And what does it live on?’,live 
54,"‘Frumenty and mince pie,’ the Gnat replied; ‘and it makes its nest in a Christmas box.’",frumenty mince pie reply make nest box 
55,"‘And then there’s the Butterfly,’ Alice went on, after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to herself, ‘I wonder if that’s the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles--because they want to turn into Snap-dragon-flies!’",be go take good look insect head fire think wonder reason insect fond fly candle want turn snap dragon fly 
56,"‘Crawling at your feet,’ said the Gnat (Alice drew her feet back in some alarm), ‘you may observe a Bread-and-Butterfly. Its wings are thin slices of Bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.’",crawl foot say draw foot alarm observe bread butterfly wing thin slice bread butter body crust head lump sugar 
57,‘And what does IT live on?’,live 
58,‘Weak tea with cream in it.’,weak tea cream 
59,A new difficulty came into Alice’s head. ‘Supposing it couldn’t find any?’ she suggested.,new difficulty come head suppose find suggest 
60,"‘Then it would die, of course.’",die course 
61,"‘But that must happen very often,’ Alice remarked thoughtfully.",happen remark 
62,"‘It always happens,’ said the Gnat.",happen say 
63,"After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. The Gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last it settled again and remarked, ‘I suppose you don’t want to lose your name?’",silent minute ponder amuse hum head last settle remark suppose want lose name 
64,"‘No, indeed,’ Alice said, a little anxiously.",say little 
65,"‘And yet I don’t know,’ the Gnat went on in a careless tone: ‘only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out “come here--,” and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn’t be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldn’t have to go, you know.’",know go careless tone think convenient manage go instance governess want call lesson call come have leave be name call course have go know 
66,"‘That would never do, I’m sure,’ said Alice: ‘the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that. If she couldn’t remember my name, she’d call me “Miss!” as the servants do.’",do sure say governess think excuse lesson remember name call servant do 
67,"‘Well, if she said “Miss,” and didn’t say anything more,’ the Gnat remarked, ‘of course you’d miss your lessons. That’s a joke. I wish YOU had made it.’",say say more remark course miss lesson joke wish make 
68,‘Why do you wish _I_ had made it?’ Alice asked. ‘It’s a very bad one.’,wish make ask bad one 
69,"But the Gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks.",sigh large tear come roll cheek 
70,"‘You shouldn’t make jokes,’ Alice said, ‘if it makes you so unhappy.’",make joke say make unhappy 
71,"Then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the poor Gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when Alice looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and walked on.",come melancholy little sigh time poor seem sigh look be see twig get chilly sit get walk 
72,"She very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and Alice felt a LITTLE timid about going into it. However, on second thoughts, she made up her mind to go on: ‘for I certainly won’t go BACK,’ she thought to herself, and this was the only way to the Eighth Square.",come open field wood other side look dark last wood feel little timid go second thought make mind go go think only way eighth 
73,"‘This must be the wood,’ she said thoughtfully to herself, ‘where things have no names. I wonder what’ll become of MY name when I go in? I shouldn’t like to lose it at all--because they’d have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name! That’s just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs--“ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF ‘DASH:’ HAD ON A BRASS COLLAR”--just fancy calling everything you met “Alice,” till one of them answered! Only they wouldn’t answer at all, if they were wise.’",wood say thing have name wonder become name go like lose have give certain ugly one fun try find creature get old name advertisement know person lose dog answer name dash have brass collar fancy call meet answer answer wise 
74,"She was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked very cool and shady. ‘Well, at any rate it’s a great comfort,’ she said as she stepped under the trees, ‘after being so hot, to get into the--into WHAT?’ she went on, rather surprised at not being able to think of the word. ‘I mean to get under the--under the--under THIS, you know!’ putting her hand on the trunk of the tree. ‘What DOES it call itself, I wonder? I do believe it’s got no name--why, to be sure it hasn’t!’",ramble way reach wood look cool shady rate great comfort say step tree hot get go surprised able think word mean get know put hand trunk tree call wonder believe get name sure 
75,"She stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again. ‘Then it really HAS happened, after all! And now, who am I? I WILL remember, if I can! I’m determined to do it!’ But being determined didn’t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling, was, ‘L, I KNOW it begins with L!’",stand silent minute think begin happen remember determined do determine help much say great deal puzzling know begin 
76,"Just then a Fawn came wandering by: it looked at Alice with its large gentle eyes, but didn’t seem at all frightened. ‘Here then! Here then!’ Alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.",fawn come wonder look large gentle eye seem frighten say hold hand try stroke start little stand look 
77,‘What do you call yourself?’ the Fawn said at last. Such a soft sweet voice it had!,call say last soft sweet voice have 
78,"‘I wish I knew!’ thought poor Alice. She answered, rather sadly, ‘Nothing, just now.’",wish know think poor answer 
79,"‘Think again,’ it said: ‘that won’t do.’",think say do 
80,"Alice thought, but nothing came of it. ‘Please, would you tell me what YOU call yourself?’ she said timidly. ‘I think that might help a little.’",think come tell call say think help little 
81,"‘I’ll tell you, if you’ll move a little further on,’ the Fawn said. ‘I can’t remember here.’",tell move little say remember 
82,"So they walked on together though the wood, Alice with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the Fawn, till they came out into another open field, and here the Fawn gave a sudden bound into the air, and shook itself free from Alice’s arms. ‘I’m a Fawn!’ it cried out in a voice of delight, ‘and, dear me! you’re a human child!’ A sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had darted away at full speed.",walk wood arm clasp soft neck come open field give sudden bind air shake free arm fawn cry voice delight dear human child sudden look alarm come beautiful brown eye moment dart full speed 
83,"Alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. ‘However, I know my name now.’ she said, ‘that’s SOME comfort. Alice--Alice--I won’t forget it again. And now, which of these finger-posts ought I to follow, I wonder?’",stand look ready cry vexation lose dear little fellow traveller know name say comfort forget finger post follow wonder 
84,"It was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it. ‘I’ll settle it,’ Alice said to herself, ‘when the road divides and they point different ways.’",difficult question answer be road wood finger post point settle say road divide point different way 
85,"But this did not seem likely to happen. She went on and on, a long way, but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts pointing the same way, one marked ‘TO TWEEDLEDUM’S HOUSE’ and the other ‘TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.’",seem likely happen go long way road divide sure finger post point same way mark other 
86,"‘I do believe,’ said Alice at last, ‘that they live in the same house! I wonder I never thought of that before--But I can’t stay there long. I’ll just call and say “how d’you do?” and ask them the way out of the wood. If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!’ So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling sure that they must be.",believe say last live same house wonder think stay call say do ask way wood get eighth get dark wander talk go turn sharp corner come fat little man help start moment recover feel sure
