1,CHAPTER I. THE HAY-LOFT,chapter hay loft 
2," I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind. An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there, and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer, and drowned themselves. My story is not the same as his. I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place. I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there.",ask tell back north wind old greek writer mention person live comfortable bear drown story same think get right account place go tell fare boy go 
3,"He lived in a low room over a coach-house; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind, as his mother very well knew. For one side of the room was built only of boards, and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind. And then let them settle between them which was the sharper! I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse, and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind. Still, this room was not very cold, except when the north wind blew stronger than usual: the room I have to do with now was always cold, except in summer, when the sun took the matter into his own hands. Indeed, I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses.",live low room coach house means back north wind mother know side room build board board old run penknife north wind let settle sharper know pull wind cat mouse know back north wind room cold north wind blow strong usual room have do cold summer sun take matter own hand sure call room loft keep hay straw oat horse 
4,"And when little Diamond--but stop: I must tell you that his father, who was a coachman, had named him after a favourite horse, and his mother had had no objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay there in bed, he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark, or moving sleepily in their dreams. For Diamond’s father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it, because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house; and Diamond’s father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed, because he was a quiet horse, and did not go to sleep standing, but lay down like a reasonable creature. But, although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night, and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind, he could not help wondering whether, if the wind should blow the house down, and he were to fall through into the manger, old Diamond mightn’t eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown. And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long, yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake, and then young Diamond knew what o’clock it was, or at least what was to be done next, which was--to go to sleep again as fast as he could.",little stop tell father coachman name favourite horse mother have objection little lay bed hear horse munch dark move dream father build bed loft board have little room own end coach house father put old stall bed quiet horse go sleep standing lay reasonable creature reasonable creature young wake middle night feel bed shake blast north wind help wonder wind blow house fall manger old eat know night gown old quiet night wake get earthquake young know o'clock least do go sleep 
5,"There was hay at his feet and hay at his head, piled up in great trusses to the very roof. Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings, which looked as if it had been sawn out for him, that he could reach his bed at all. For the stock of hay was, of course, always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow. Sometimes the whole space of the loft, with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in, would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard. Sometimes, when his mother had undressed him in her room, and told him to trot to bed by himself, he would creep into the heart of the hay, and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind, and how warm it was inside there in his bed, and how he could go to it when he pleased, only he wouldn’t just yet; he would get a little colder first. And ever as he grew colder, his bed would grow warmer, till at last he would scramble out of the hay, shoot like an arrow into his bed, cover himself up, and snuggle down, thinking what a happy boy he was. He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall, and blew about him all night. For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick, and on the other side of them was the north wind.",be hay foot hay head pile great trusse very roof little lane several turning look saw reach bed stock hay course state slow ebb sudden flow whole space loft little pane roof star look lie open open eye lay bed yellow wall sweet smelling fibre close view distance yard mother undress room tell trot bed creep heart hay lie think cold wind warm bed go pleased get little cold first grow cold bed grow warm last scramble hay shoot arrow bed cover snuggle think happy boy have least idea wind get chink wall blow night back bed board inch thick other side north wind 
6,"Now, as I have already said, these boards were soft and crumbly. To be sure, they were tarred on the outside, yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber. Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it, little Diamond found one night, after he lay down, that a knot had come out of one of them, and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion. Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right; so he jumped out of bed again, got a little strike of hay, twisted it up, folded it in the middle, and, having thus made it into a cork, stuck it into the hole in the wall. But the wind began to blow loud and angrily, and, as Diamond was falling asleep, out blew his cork and hit him on the nose, just hard enough to wake him up quite, and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole. He searched for his hay-cork, found it, stuck it in harder, and was just dropping off once more, when, pop! with an angry whistle behind it, the cork struck him again, this time on the cheek. Up he rose once more, made a fresh stopple of hay, and corked the hole severely. But he was hardly down again before--pop! it came on his forehead. He gave it up, drew the clothes above his head, and was soon fast asleep.",say board soft crumbly sure tar outside many place tinder timber happen soft part wear little find night lay knot come wind blow cold imperious fashion have fancy leave thing wrong set jump bed get little strike hay twist fold middle make cork stick hole wall wind begin blow fall asleep blow cork hit nose wake let hear wind whistling shrill hole search hay cork find stick hard drop more pop angry whistle cork strike time cheek rise make fresh stopple hay cork hole pop come forehead give draw clothes head fast asleep 
7,"Although the next day was very stormy, Diamond forgot all about the hole, for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother’s fire with a broken chair, a three-legged stool, and a blanket, and then sitting in it. His mother, however, discovered it, and pasted a bit of brown paper over it, so that, when Diamond had snuggled down the next night, he had no occasion to think of it.",next day stormy forget hole busy make cave side mother fire break chair legge stool blanket sit mother discover paste bit brown paper snuggle next night have occasion think 
8,"Presently, however, he lifted his head and listened. Who could that be talking to him? The wind was rising again, and getting very loud, and full of rushes and whistles. He was sure some one was talking--and very near him, too, it was. But he was not frightened, for he had not yet learned how to be; so he sat up and hearkened. At last the voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded a little angry, appeared to come from the back of the bed. He crept nearer to it, and laid his ear against the wall. Then he heard nothing but the wind, which sounded very loud indeed. The moment, however, that he moved his head from the wall, he heard the voice again, close to his ear. He felt about with his hand, and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole. Against this he laid his ear, and then he heard the voice quite distinctly. There was, in fact, a little corner of the paper loose, and through that, as from a mouth in the wall, the voice came.",lift head listen talk wind rise get loud full rushe whistle sure one talk frighten learn sit hearken last voice gentle sound little angry appear come back bed creep lay ear wall hear wind sound loud moment move head wall hear voice close ear feel hand come piece paper mother paste hole lay ear hear voice be fact little corner paper mouth wall voice come

40,"In came a long whistling spear of cold, and struck his little naked chest. He scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes, and covered himself up: there was no paper now between him and the voice, and he felt a little--not frightened exactly--I told you he had not learned that yet--but rather queer; for what a strange person this North Wind must be that lived in the great house--“called Out-of-Doors, I suppose,”  thought Diamond--and made windows into people’s beds! But the voice began again; and he could hear it quite plainly, even with his head under the bed-clothes. It was a still more gentle voice now, although six times as large and loud as it had been, and he thought it sounded a little like his mother’s.",come long whistle spear cold strike little naked chest scramble tumble bedclothe cover be paper voice feel little frighten tell learn queer strange person live great house call suppose think make window person bed voice begin hear head bed clothes gentle voice time large loud think sound little mother

71,"The instant he said the word, a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall, and swept the clothes off Diamond. He started up in terror. Leaning over him was the large, beautiful, pale face of a woman. Her dark eyes looked a little angry, for they had just begun to flash; but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry. What was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction, so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her, hair but as Diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement, mingled with confidence--for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty--her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness, and fell down all about her again, till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud. From her eyes came all the light by which Diamond saw her face and her, hair; and that was all he did see of her yet. The wind was over and gone.",instant say word tremendous blast wind crash board wall sweep clothes start terror lean large beautiful pale face woman dark eye look little angry begin flash quivering sweet upper lip make look go cry strange head stream black hair direction darkness hay loft look make hair gaze speechless amazement mingle confidence boy entrance mighty beauty hair begin gather darkness fall face look midst moon cloud eye come light see face hair see wind gone
