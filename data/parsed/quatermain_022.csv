1,CHAPTER XXI. AWAY! AWAY!,

3,"At the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses; and, turning, glanced at the battle beneath us, which, illumined as it was by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red, looked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an actual hand-to-hand combat. The distinguishing scenic effect from that distance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the swords and spears, otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have been expected. The great green lap of sward in which the struggle was being fought out, the bold round outline of the hills behind, and the wide sweep of the plain beyond, seemed to dwarf it; and what was tremendous enough when one was in it, grew insignificant when viewed from the distance. But is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of our race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and worry? How utterly antlike, and morally and physically insignificant, must they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths above!",top rise halt second breathe horse turn glance battle illumine fierce ray sink sun stain whole scene red look wild titanic picture actual hand hand combat distinguish scenic effect distance countless distinct flash light reflect sword spear panorama grand expect great green lap sward struggle fight bold round outline hill wide sweep plain seem dwarf tremendous grow insignificant view distance affair doing race blow loud trumpet make fuss worry antlike insignificant seem calm eye watch arching depth 
4,"‘We win the day, Macumazahn,’ said old Umslopogaas, taking in the whole situation with a glance of his practised eye. ‘Look, the Lady of the Night’s forces give on every side, there is no stiffness left in them, they bend like hot iron, they are fighting with but half a heart. But alas! the battle will in a manner be drawn, for the darkness gathers, and the regiments will not be able to follow and slay!’--and he shook his head sadly. ‘But,’ he added, ‘I do not think that they will fight again. We have fed them with too strong a meat. Ah! it is well to have lived! At last I have seen a fight worth seeing.’",win day say old take whole situation glance practise eye look force give side be stiffness leave bend hot iron fight heart battle manner draw darkness gather regiment able follow slay shake head add think fight feed strong meat well live last see fight worth see 
5,"By this time we were on our way again, and as we went side by side I told him what our mission was, and how that, if it failed, all the lives that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain.",time way go side side tell mission fail life lose day lose vain 
6,"‘Ah!’ he said, ‘nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these, and to be there before the dawn! Well--away! away! man can but try, Macumazahn; and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old “witch-finder’s”  [Agon’s] skull for him. Once he wanted to burn us, the old “rain-maker”, did he? And now he would set a snare for my mother [Nyleptha], would he? Good! So sure as my name is the name of the Woodpecker, so surely, be my mother alive or dead, will I split him to the beard. Ay, by T’Chaka’s head I swear it!’ and he shook Inkosi-kaas as he galloped. By now the darkness was closing in, but fortunately there would be a moon later, and the road was good.",say mile horse dawn man try time split old witch finder skull want burn old rain maker set snare mother good sure name name mother alive dead split beard head swear shake gallop darkness close be moon road good 
7,"On we sped through the twilight, the two splendid horses we bestrode had got their wind by this, and were sweeping along with a wide steady stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile. Down the side of slopes we galloped, across wide vales that stretched to the foot of far-off hills. Nearer and nearer grew the blue hills; now we were travelling up their steeps, and now we were over and passing towards others that sprang up like visions in the far, faint distance beyond.",spe twilight splendid horse bestrode get wind sweep wide steady stride fail vary mile mile side slope gallop wide vale stretch foot hill nearer grow blue hill travel steep pass other spring vision far faint distance 
8,"On, never pausing or drawing rein, through the perfect quiet of the night, that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses’ hoofs; on, past deserted villages, where only some forgotten starving dog howled a melancholy welcome; on, past lonely moated dwellings; on, through the white patchy moonlight, that lay coldly upon the wide bosom of the earth, as though there was no warmth in it; on, knee to knee, for hour after hour!",pause draw rein perfect quiet night set song fall music horse hoof desert village forget starve dog howl melancholy welcome lonely moated dwelling white patchy moonlight lay wide bosom earth be warmth knee knee hour hour 
9,"We spake not, but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious horses, and listened to their deep, long-drawn breaths as they filled their great lungs, and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round hoofs. Grim and black indeed did old Umslopogaas look beside me, mounted upon the great white horse, like Death in the Revelation of St John, as now and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road, and pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house.",spake bend neck glorious horse listen deep long draw breath fill great lung regular unfaltering ring round hoof grim black old look mount great white horse lift fierce set face gaze road point axe distant rise house 
10,"And so on, still on, without break or pause for hour after hour.",break pause hour hour 
11,"At last I felt that even the splendid animal that I rode was beginning to give out. I looked at my watch; it was nearly midnight, and we were considerably more than half way. On the top of a rise was a little spring, which I remembered because I had slept by it a few nights before, and here I motioned to Umslopogaas to pull up, having determined to give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in. He did so, and we dismounted--that is to say, Umslopogaas did, and then helped me off, for what with fatigue, stiffness, and the pain of my wound, I could not do so for myself; and then the gallant horses stood panting there, resting first one leg and then another, while the sweat fell drip, drip, from them, and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night air.",last feel splendid animal ride begin give look watch midnight more half way top rise little spring remember sleep few night motion pull determine give horse minute breathe do dismount say help fatigue stiffness pain wound do gallant horse stand pant rest first leg sweat fall drip drip steam rise hang pale cloud still night air 
12,"Leaving Umslopogaas to hold the horses, I hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters. I had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday, when the battle began, and I was parched up, though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry. Then, having laved my fevered head and hands, I returned, and the Zulu went and drank. Next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls each--no more; and oh, what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from the water! There were yet two minutes, and I employed it in hobbling up and down to try and relieve my stiffness, and in inspecting the condition of the horses. My mare, gallant animal though she was, was evidently much distressed; she hung her head, and her eye looked sick and dull; but Daylight, Nyleptha’s glorious horse--who, if he is served aright, should, like the steeds who saved great Rameses in his need, feed for the rest of his days out of a golden manger--was still comparatively speaking fresh, notwithstanding the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight to carry. He was ‘tucked up’, indeed, and his legs were weary, but his eye was bright and clear, and he held his shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that seemed to say that whoever failed _he_ was good for those five-and-forty miles that yet lay between us and Milosis. Then Umslopogaas helped me into the saddle and--vigorous old savage that he was!--vaulted into his own without touching a stirrup, and we were off once more, slowly at first, till the horses got into their stride, and then more swiftly. So we passed over another ten miles, and then came a long, weary rise of some six or seven miles, and three times did my poor black mare nearly come to the ground with me. But on the top she seemed to gather herself together, and rattled down the slope with long, convulsive strides, breathing in gasps. We did that three or four miles more swiftly than any since we had started on our wild ride, but I felt it to be a last effort, and I was right. Suddenly my poor horse took the bit between her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some three or four hundred yards, and then, with two or three jerky strides, pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head, I rolling myself free as she did so. As I struggled to my feet the brave beast raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes, and then her head dropped with a groan and she was dead. Her heart was broken.",leave hold horse hobble spring drink deep sweet water have single mouthful wine midday battle begin parched fatigue great allow feel hungry lave fevered head hand return go drink allow horse take couple mouthful more struggle have get poor beast water be minute employ hobble try relieve stiffness inspect condition horse mare gallant animal distress hang head eye look sick dull glorious horse serve steed save great need feed rest day golden manger speak fresh notwithstand fact have heavy weight carry tuck leg weary eye bright clear hold shapely head gaze darkness way seem say fail good mile lay help saddle vigorous old savage vault own touch stirrup more first horse get stride pass mile come long weary rise mile time poor black mare come ground top seem gather rattle slope long convulsive stride breathe gasp do mile start wild ride feel last effort right poor horse take bit tooth bolt stretch level ground yard jerky stride pull fall crash head roll free do struggle foot brave beast raise head look piteous bloodshot eye head drop groan dead heart break 
13,"Umslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase, and I looked at him in dismay. There were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn, and how were we to do it with one horse? It seemed hopeless, but I had forgotten the old Zulu’s extraordinary running powers.",pull carcase look dismay be more mile do dawn do horse seem hopeless forget old extraordinary running power

17,"Then off we went again, almost as fast as before; and oh, the relief it was to me to get that change of horses! Anybody who has ever ridden against time will know what it meant.",go relief get change horse ride time know mean 
18,"Daylight sped along at a long stretching hand-gallop, giving the gaunt Zulu a lift at every stride. It was a wonderful thing to see old Umslopogaas run mile after mile, his lips slightly parted and his nostrils agape like the horse’s. Every five miles or so we stopped for a few minutes to let him get his breath, and then flew on again.",daylight spe long stretch hand gallop give gaunt lift stride wonderful thing see old run mile mile lip part nostril agape horse mile stop few minute let get breath fly 
19,"‘Canst thou go farther,’ I said at the third of these stoppages, ‘or shall I leave thee to follow me?’",go say third stoppage leave follow

21,"‘I reach it or I die,’ he gasped.",reach die gasp 
22,"Oh, that last five miles! The skin was rubbed from the inside of my legs, and every movement of my horse gave me anguish. Nor was that all. I was exhausted with toil, want of food and sleep, and also suffering very much from the blow I had received on my left side; it seemed as though a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung. Poor Daylight, too, was pretty nearly finished, and no wonder. But there was a smell of dawn in the air, and we might not stay; better that all three of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while there was life in us. The air was thick and heavy, as it sometimes is before the dawn breaks, and--another infallible sign in certain parts of Zu-Vendis that sunrise is at hand--hundreds of little spiders pendant on the end of long tough webs were floating about in it. These early-rising creatures, or rather their webs, caught upon the horse’s and our own forms by scores, and, as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush them off, we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads that streamed out a yard or more behind us--and a very strange appearance they must have given us.",last mile skin rub inside leg movement horse give anguish exhaust toil want food sleep suffer blow receive left side seem piece bone pierce lung poor daylight finish wonder be smell dawn air stay good die road linger be life air thick heavy dawn break infallible sign certain part sunrise hand hundred little spider pendant end long tough web float early rise creature web catch horse own form score have time energy brush rush cover hundred long grey thread stream yard more strange appearance give

37,"‘Is it thou, Kara?’ I cry; ‘I am Macumazahn. Bid the guard let down the bridge and throw wide the gate. Quick, quick!’",cry be guard let bridge throw gate quick quick 
38,"Then followed a space that seemed to me endless, but at length the bridge fell and one half of the gate opened and we got into the courtyard, where at last poor Daylight fell down beneath me, as I thought, dead. Except Kara, there was nobody to be seen, and his look was wild, and his garments were all torn. He had opened the gate and let down the bridge alone, and was now getting them up and shut again (as, owing to a very ingenious arrangement of cranks and levers, one man could easily do, and indeed generally did do).",follow space seem endless length bridge fall half gate open get courtyard last poor fall think dead be see look wild garment torn open gate let bridge get shut ow ingenious arrangement crank lever man do do

41,"His words gave me fresh energy. Catching him by the arm, I staggered, followed by Umslopogaas, who reeled after us like a drunken man, through the courtyards, up the great hall, which was silent as the grave, towards the Queen’s sleeping-place.",word give fresh energy catch arm stagger follow reel drunken man courtyard great hall silent grave sleeping place 
42,"We reached the first ante-room--no guards; the second, still no guards. Oh, surely the thing was done! we were too late after all, too late! The silence and solitude of those great chambers was dreadful, and weighed me down like an evil dream. On, right into Nyleptha’s chamber we rushed and staggered, sick at heart, fearing the very worst; we saw there was a light in it, ay, and a figure bearing the light. Oh, thank God, it is the White Queen herself, the Queen unharmed! There she stands in her night gear, roused, by the clatter of our coming, from her bed, the heaviness of sleep yet in her eyes, and a red blush of fear and shame mantling her lovely breast and cheek.",reach first ante room guard second guard thing do late late silence solitude great chamber dreadful weigh evil dream chamber rush stagger sick heart fear very bad see be light figure bear light thank white unharm stand night gear rouse clatter come bed heaviness sleep eye red blush fear shame mantle lovely breast cheek

47,"Thus adjured she ran and called through the curtains towards some room beyond, and then hastily put on her sandals and a thick cloak, by which time a dozen or so of half-dressed women were pouring into the room.",adjure run call curtain room put sandal thick cloak time half dress woman pour room

55,"‘Go swiftly and secretly; go for your very lives,’ I added.",go go very life add 
56,"In another moment they had left with Kara, whom I told to rejoin us at the door leading from the great courtyard on to the stairway as soon as he had made fast behind the girls. Thither, too, Umslopogaas and I made our way, followed by the Queen and her women. As we went we tore off mouthfuls of food, and between them I told her what I knew of the danger which encompassed her, and how we found Kara, and how all the guards and men-servants were gone, and she was alone with her women in that great place; and she told me, too, that a rumour had spread through the town that our army had been utterly destroyed, and that Sorais was marching in triumph on Milosis, and how in consequence thereof all men had fallen away from her.",moment leave tell rejoin door lead great courtyard stairway make girl make way follow woman go tore mouthful food tell know danger encompass find guard men-servant gone alone woman great place tell rumour spread town army destroy march triumph consequence man fall 
57,"Though all this takes some time to tell, we had not been but six or seven minutes in the palace; and notwithstanding that the golden roof of the temple being very lofty was ablaze with the rays of the rising sun, it was not yet dawn, nor would be for another ten minutes. We were in the courtyard now, and here my wound pained me so that I had to take Nyleptha’s arm, while Umslopogaas rolled along after us, eating as he went.",take time tell minute palace notwithstand golden roof temple lofty ablaze ray rise sun dawn minute courtyard wound pain have take arm roll eat go

59,"I looked through and stood aghast, as well I might. The door was gone, and so were the outer gates of bronze--entirely gone. They had been taken from their hinges, and as we afterwards found, hurled from the stairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath. There in front of us was the semicircular standing-space, about twice the size of a large oval dining-table, and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to the main stair--and that was all.",look stand aghast door gone outer gate bronze gone take hinge find hurl stairway ground foot front semicircular standing space size large oval dining table curved black marble step lead main stair
