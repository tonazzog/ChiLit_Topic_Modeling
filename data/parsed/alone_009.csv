1,CHAPTER IX. A NEW BROOM AND A CROSSING.,new broom crossing 
2," The morning was a fine soft, sunny December day, such as comes sometimes after a long season of rain and fog, and Tony proposed taking Dolly out for a walk through the streets, to which Oliver gladly consented, as it would give to him exactly the undisturbed leisure he needed for writing his letter to Charlotte. But Dolly was not in her usual spirits; on the contrary, she was grave and sober, and at length Tony, thinking she was tired, sat down on a door-step, and took her upon his knee, to tell her his dream of the wonderful broom which swept beautifully all by itself. Dolly grew more and more pensive after hearing this, and sat silent for a long time, with her small head resting thoughtfully upon her hand, as she looked up and down the street.",morning fine soft sunny day such come long season rain fog propose take walk street consent give undisturbed leisure need write letter usual spirit contrary grave sober length think tired sit door step take knee tell dream wonderful broom sweep grow more pensive hear sit silent long time small head rest hand look street 
3,"""Dolly 'ud like to buy a boom,"" she said, at last, ""a great, big boom; and gan-pa 'ill smoke his pipe again to-night. Dolly's growing a big girl; and me must be a good girl till mammy comes back. Let us go and buy a big boom, Tony.""",like buy boom say last great big boom gan pa smoke pipe night grow big girl good girl mammy come let go buy big boom 
4,"For a few minutes Tony tried to shake her resolution, and persuade her to change her mind. He even tempted her with the sight of a doll in a shop-window; but she remained steadfast, and he was not sorry to give in at last. Since the idea had entered his head that the money had been given to him for the purpose of buying a broom, he had rather regretted parting with it, and he felt some anxiety lest he should not be allowed a second chance. Dolly's light-heartedness had returned, and she trotted cheerfully by his side as they walked on in search of a shop where they could make their purchase. It was some time before they found one, and they had already left behind them the busier thoroughfares, and had reached a knot of quieter streets where there were more foot-passengers, for the fine morning had tempted many people out for pleasure as well as business. Tony was particular in his choice of a broom, but once bought, he carried it over his shoulder, and went on his way with Dolly in triumph.",few minute try shake resolution persuade change mind tempt sight doll shop window remain steadfast sorry give last idea enter head money give purpose buy broom regret part feel anxiety allow second chance light heartedness return trotet side walk search shop make purchase time find leave busy thoroughfare reach knot quiet street be more foot passenger fine morning tempt many person pleasure business particular choice broom buy carry shoulder go way triumph 
5,"They were passing along chattering busily, when Tony's eyes fell upon a child about as old as Dolly, standing on the kerb-stone with a lady, who looked anxiously across to the other side of the broad and very dirty road, for the day before had been rainy. They were both finely dressed, and the little girl had on new boots of shining leather, which it was evident she was very much afraid of soiling. For a minute Tony only looked on at their perplexity, but then he went up to them, holding Dolly by the hand.",pass chatter eye fall child old stand kerb stone lady look other side broad dirty road day rainy dress little girl have new boot shine leather evident afraid soil minute look perplexity go hold hand

7,"""If you'll take care of my little girl,"" he said, ""I'll carry your little girl across the road. I'm wery clean for a street-boy, all but my feet, 'cos I've got this little girl to take care of; and I'll do it wery gentle.""",take care little girl say carry little girl road clean street boy foot get little girl take care do gentle 
8,"Both the lady and the child looked very searchingly into Tony's face. It was pale and meagre; but there was a pleasant smile upon it, and his eyes shone down upon the two children with a very loving light in them. The lady took Dolly's hand in hers, nodding permission for him to carry her little child over to the other side, and she waited for him to come back to his own charge. Then she took out her purse, and put twopence into his hand.",lady child look face pale meagre be pleasant smile eye shine child loving light lady take hand nodd permission carry little child other side wait come own charge take purse put twopence hand 
9,"""Thank ye, my lady,"" said Tony; ""but I didn't do it for that. I'm only looking out for a crossing. Me and Dolly have bought this broom, and I'm looking out for a place to make a good crossing in.""",thank lady say do look crossing buy broom look place make good crossing 
10,"""Why not make one here?"" asked the lady.",make ask lady 
11,"It seemed a good place to try one in; there were four roads meeting, and a cab-stand close by. Plenty of people were passing to and fro, and the middle of the road was very muddy. Tony begged a wisp of straw from a cabman, to make a seat for Dolly in the sunshine under a blank bit of wall, while he set to work with a will, feeling rather pleased than not that the broom would not sweep of itself. A crossing was speedily made, and for two or three hours Tony kept it well swept. By that time it was twelve o'clock, and Dolly's dinner would be ready for her before they could reach home, if old Oliver had not forgotten it. It seemed a great pity to leave his new post so early. Most passers-by, certainly, had appeared not to see him at all; but he had already received fivepence halfpenny, chiefly in halfpence, from ladies who were out for their morning's walk; and Dolly was enjoying herself very much in the sunshine, receiving all the attention which he could spare from his crossing. However a beginning was made. The broom and the crossing were his property; and Tony's heart, beat fast with pride and gladness as he carried the weary little Dolly all the way home again. He resolved to put by half of his morning's earnings towards replacing the fourpenny-piece she had given back to him; or perhaps he would buy her a beautiful doll, dressed like a real lady.",seem good place try be road meeting cab stand plenty person pass middle road muddy begg wisp straw cabman make seat sunshine blank bit wall set work will feel pleased broom sweep crossing make hour keep sweep time o'clock dinner ready reach home old forget seem great pity leave new post most passer appear see receive fivepence halfpenny halfpence lady morning walk enjoy sunshine receive attention spare crossing beginning make broom crossing property heart beat pride gladness carry weary little way resolve put half morning earnings replace fourpenny piece give buy beautiful doll dress real lady
