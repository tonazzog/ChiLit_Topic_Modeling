2," It was winter and bitter cold of mornings. Consequently Stalky and Beetle--McTurk being of the offensive type that makes ornate toilet under all circumstances--drowsed till the last moment before turning out to call-over in the gas-lit gymnasium. It followed that they were often late; and since every unpunctuality earned them a black mark, and since three black marks a week meant defaulters’ drill, equally it followed that they spent hours under the Sergeant’s hand. Foxy drilled the defaulters with all the pomp of his old parade-ground. “Don’t think it’s any pleasure to me” (his introduction never varied). “I’d much sooner be smoking a quiet pipe in my own quarters--but I see we ‘ave the Old Brigade on our ‘ands this afternoon.

165,"The Head had duly informed the Council that their recommendation had been acted upon, and that, so far as he could learn, the boys were drilling. He said nothing of the terms on which they drilled. Naturally, General Collinson was delighted and told his friends. One of his friends rejoiced in a friend, a Member of Parliament--a zealous, an intelligent, and, above all, a patriotic person, anxious to do the most good in the shortest possible time. But we cannot answer, alas! for the friends of our friends. If Collinson’s friend had introduced him to the General, the latter would have taken his measure and saved much. But the friend merely spoke of his friend; and since no two people in the world see eye to eye, the picture conveyed to Collinson was inaccurate. Moreover, the man was an M.P., an impeccable Conservative, and the General had the English soldier’s lurking respect for any member of the Court of Last Appeal. He was going down into the West country, to spread light in somebody’s benighted constituency. Wouldn’t it be a good idea if, armed with the General’s recommendation, he, taking the admirable and newly established cadet-corps for his text, spoke a few words--“Just talked to the boys a little--eh? You know the kind of thing that would be acceptable; and he’d be the very man to do it.

168,"“You’re quite right.” The island was then entering on five years of Mr. Gladstone’s rule; and the General did not like what he had seen of it.

That, if he might say so, was uncommonly well put.",right island enter year rule like see write question boy day make man say put 
169,"In reply, the Head stated that he should be delighted to welcome Mr. Raymond Martin, M.P., of whom he had heard so much; to put him up for the night, and to allow him to address the school on any subject that he conceived would interest them.

187,"In a few colorless words, the Head introduced the speaker and sat down amid applause. When Mr. Martin took the applause to himself, they naturally applauded more than ever. It was some time before he could begin. He had no knowledge of the school--its tradition or heritage. He did not know that the last census showed that eighty per cent. of the boys had been born abroad--in camp, cantonment, or upon the high seas; or that seventy-five per cent. were sons of officers in one or other of the services--Willoughbys, Paulets, De Castros, Maynes, Randalls, after their kind--looking to follow their fathers’ profession. The Head might have told him this, and much more; but, after an hour-long dinner in his company, the Head decided to say nothing whatever. Mr. Raymond Martin seemed to know so much already.",few colorless word introduce speaker sit applause take applause applaud more time begin have knowledge school tradition heritage know last census show per cent boy bear camp cantonment high sea per cent son officer other service kind look follow father profession tell more hour long dinner company decide say seem know

He supposed they knew--hey?--what he had come down for? It was not often that he had an opportunity to talk to boys.

194,"There was one tense gasp--among the juniors almost a shriek--of quivering horror, he was a heathen--an outcast---beyond the extremest pale of toleration--self-damned before all men.

Now, he himself had had some experience of these duties, as a Major in a volunteer regiment, and he was glad to learn that they had established a volunteer corps in their midst. The establishment of such an establishment conduced to a proper and healthy spirit, which, if fostered, would be of great benefit to the land they loved and were so proud to belong to. Some of those now present expected, he had no doubt--some of them anxiously looked forward to leading their men against the bullets of England’s foes; to confronting the stricken field in all the pride of their youthful manhood.",expect few year have honor commission wear sword have experience duty volunteer regiment glad learn establish volunteer corps midst establishment establishment conduce proper healthy spirit foster great benefit land love proud belong present expect have doubt look lead man bullet foe confront stricken field pride youthful manhood 
196,"Now the reserve of a boy is tenfold deeper than the reserve of a maid, she being made for one end only by blind Nature, but man for several. With a large and healthy hand, he tore down these veils, and trampled them under the well-intentioned feet of eloquence. In a raucous voice, he cried aloud little matters, like the hope of Honor and the dream of Glory, that boys do not discuss even with their most intimate equals, cheerfully assuming that, till he spoke, they had never considered these possibilities. He pointed them to shining goals, with fingers which smudged out all radiance on all horizons. He profaned the most secret places of their souls with outcries and gesticulations, he bade them consider the deeds of their ancestors in such a fashion that they were flushed to their tingling ears. Some of them--the rending voice cut a frozen stillness--might have had relatives who perished in defence of their country. They thought, not a few of them, of an old sword in a passage, or above a breakfast-room table, seen and fingered by stealth since they could walk. He adjured them to emulate those illustrious examples; and they looked all ways in their extreme discomfort.",reserve boy tenfold deep reserve maid make end blind man several large healthy hand tore veil trample intentioned foot eloquence raucous voice cry little matter hope dream boy discuss intimate equal assume speak consider possibility point shine goal finger smudge radiance horizon profane secret place soul outcry gesticulation bid consider deed ancestor fashion flush tingling ear rending voice cut freeze stillness have relative perish defence country think few old sword passage breakfast room table see finger stealth walk adjure emulate illustrious example look way extreme discomfort

198,"And so he worked towards his peroration--which, by the way, he used later with overwhelming success at a meeting of electors--while they sat, flushed and uneasy, in sour disgust. After many, many words, he reached for the cloth-wrapped stick and thrust one hand in his bosom. This--this was the concrete symbol of their land--worthy of all honor and reverence! Let no boy look on this flag who did not purpose to worthily add to its imperishable lustre. He shook it before them--a large calico Union Jack, staring in all three colors, and waited for the thunder of applause that should crown his effort.",work peroration way use overwhelming success meeting elector sit flush uneasy sour disgust many many word reach cloth wrap stick thrust hand bosom concrete symbol land worthy honor reverence let boy look flag purpose add imperishable lustre shake large calico stare color wait thunder applause crown effort 
199,"They looked in silence. They had certainly seen the thing before--down at the coastguard station, or through a telescope, half-mast high when a brig went ashore on Braunton Sands; above the roof of the Golf-club, and in Keyte’s window, where a certain kind of striped sweetmeat bore it in paper on each box. But the College never displayed it; it was no part of the scheme of their lives; the Head had never alluded to it; their fathers had not declared it unto them. It was a matter shut up, sacred and apart. What, in the name of everything caddish, was he driving at, who waved that horror before their eyes? Happy thought! Perhaps he was drunk.",look silence see thing coastguard station telescope half mast high brig go roof golf club window certain kind stripe sweetmeat bear paper box display part scheme life allude father declare matter shut sacred name caddish drive wave horror eye happy thought drunk

The Head vows that he did no such thing; or that, if he did, it must have been something in his eye; but those who were present are persuaded that he winked, once, openly and solemnly, after the word “enjoyable.” Mr. Raymond Martin got his applause full tale.

I never knew boys could cheer like that.”",day know right case vow do such thing eye present persuade wink word enjoyable get applause full tale say vanity think few word go heart know boy cheer 
203,"He left as the prayer-bell rang, and the boys lined up against the wall. The flag lay still unrolled on the desk, Foxy regarding it with pride, for he had been touched to the quick by Mr. Martin’s eloquence. The Head and the Common-room, standing back on the dais, could not see the glaring offence, but a prefect left the line, rolled it up swiftly, and as swiftly tossed it into a glove and foil locker.",leave prayer bell ring boy line wall flag lay unroll desk regard pride touch quick eloquence common room stand dais see glaring offence prefect leave line roll toss glove foil locker

Mr. Raymond Martin, beyond question, was born in a gutter, and bred in a board-school, where they played marbles.
