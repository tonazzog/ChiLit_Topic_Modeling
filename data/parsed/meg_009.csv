1,CHAPTER IX. Little Meg's Friends in Need,little friend 
2,"These were hard times for little Meg.  The weather was not severely cold yet, or the children would have been bitterly starved up in their cold attic, where Meg was obliged to be very careful of the coal.  All her mother's clothes were in pledge now, as well as her own and Robin's; and it seemed as if it would soon come to pawning their poor bed and their scanty furniture.  Yet Meg kept up a brave spirit, and, as often as the day was fine enough, took her children out into the streets, loitering about the cook-shops, where the heat from the cellar kitchens lent a soothing warmth to their shivering bodies.",hard time little weather cold child starve cold attic oblige careful coal mother clothes pledge own seem come pawn poor bed scanty furniture keep brave spirit day fine take child street loiter cook shop heat cellar kitchen loan soothing warmth shiver body 
3,"About the middle of December the first sharp frost set in, and Meg felt herself driven back from this last relief.  She had taken the children out as usual, but she had no shoes to put on their feet, and nothing but their thin old rags to clothe them with.  Robin's feet were red and blue with cold, like her own; but Meg could not see her own, and did not feel the cold as much for them as for Robin's.  His face had lost a little of its roundness and freshness, and his black eyes some of their brightness since his birthday; and poor Meg's heart bled at the sight of him as he trudged along the icy pavement of the streets at her side. There was one cook-shop from which warm air and pleasant odours came up through an iron grating, and Meg hurried on to it to feel its grateful warmth; but the shutters of the shop were not taken down, and the cellar window was unclosed.  Little Meg turned away sadly, and bent her bare and aching feet homewards again, hushing baby, who wailed a pitiful low wail in her ears.  Robin, too, dragged himself painfully along, for he had struck his numbed foot against a piece of iron, and the wound was bleeding a little.  They had turned down a short street which they had often passed through before, at the end of which was a small shop, displaying in its window a few loaves of bread, and some bottles containing different kinds of sweetmeats, such as they had indulged in sometimes in the palmy days when father was at home.  The door was divided in the middle, and the lower half was closed, while the upper stood open, giving a full view of the shop within.  Meg's old brown bonnet just rose above the top of the closed half, and her wistful face turned for a moment towards the tempting sight of a whole shelf full of loaves; but she was going on slowly, when a kindly voice hailed her from the dark interior.",middle first sharp frost set feel drive last relief take child usual have shoe put foot thin old rag clothe foot red blue cold own see own feel cold much face lose little roundness freshness black eye brightness birthday poor heart ble sight trudge icy pavement street side be cook shop warm air pleasant odour come iron grating hurry feel grateful warmth shutter shop take cellar window unclosed little turn bend bare ach foot homeward hush baby wail pitiful low wail ear drag strike numb foot piece iron wound bleed little turn short street pass end small shop display window few loaf bread bottle contain different kind sweetmeat such indulge palmy day father home door divide middle low half close upper stand open give full view shop old brown bonnet rise top close half wistful face turn moment tempting sight whole shelf full loaf go kindly voice hail dark interior

5,"'They're here, sir, thank you,' answered Meg, in a more womanly way than ever, for she felt very low to-day.  'We're only doing middling, thank you, sir.'",sir thank answer womanly way feel low day do middling thank sir 
6,"'Why, father's ship's come in,' said her good-natured friend from the docks, coming forward and wiping his lips, as if he had just finished a good meal.  'What makes you be doing only middling?'",father ship come say good natured friend dock come wipe lip finish good meal make do middle

8,"'Come in and tell us all about it,' he said.  'Hollo, Mrs Blossom! just step this way, if you please.'",come tell say step way 
9,"There was a little kitchen at the back of the shop, from which came a very savoury smell of cooking, as the door opened, and a round, fat, rosy-cheeked woman, of about fifty years of age, looked out inquiringly.  She came a step or two nearer the door, as Meg's friend beckoned to her with a clasp-knife he held in his hand.",be little kitchen back shop come savoury smell cooking door open round fat rosy cheeked woman year age look come step door friend beckon clasp knife hold hand 
10,"'These little 'uns look cold and hungry, don't they, Mrs Blossom?' he said.  'You smell something as smells uncommon good, don't you?' he asked of Meg, who had sniffed a little, unconsciously.",little uns look cold hungry say smell smell uncommon good ask sniff little 
11,"'Yes, please, sir,' answered Meg.",sir answer 
12,"'I've ate as much as ever I can eat for to-day,' said her friend, 'so you give 'em the rest, Mrs Blossom, and I'll be off.  Only just tell me why father's not come home in his ship.'",eat much eat day say friend give rest tell father come ship

18,"'Well, I never!' cried Mrs Blossom, seizing the baby out of Meg's, and clasping it in her own arms.  'I never heard anything like that.'",cry seize baby clasp own arm hear 
19,"'Nor me,' said the man, catching up Robin, and bearing him off into the warm little kitchen, where a saucepan of hot tripe was simmering on the hob, and a round table, with two plates upon it, was drawn up close to the fire.  He put Robin down on Mrs Blossom's seat, and lifted Meg into a large arm-chair he had just quitted.",say man catching bear warm little kitchen saucepan hot tripe simmer hob round table plate draw close fire put seat lift large arm chair quit 
20,"'I guess you could eat a morsel of tripe,' he said, ladling it out in overflowing spoonfuls upon the plates.  'Mrs Blossom, some potatoes, if you please, and some bread; and do you feed the baby whilst the little woman gets her dinner.  Now, I'm off.  Mrs Blossom, you settle about 'em coming here again.'",guess eat morsel tripe say ladl overflow spoonful plate potato bread feed baby little woman get dinner settle come 
21,"He was off, as he said, in an instant.  Meg sat in her large arm-chair, grasping a big knife and fork in her small hands, but she could not swallow a morsel at first for watching Robin and the baby, who was sucking in greedily spoonfuls of potatoes, soaked in the gravy.  Mrs Blossom urged her to fall to, and she tried to obey; but her pale face quivered all over, and letting fall her knife and fork, she hid it in her trembling hands.",say instant sit large arm chair grasp big knife fork small hand swallow morsel first watch baby suck greedily spoonful potato soak gravy urge fall try obey pale face quiver let fall knife fork hide tremble hand 
22,"'If you please, ma'am, I'm only so glad,' said little Meg as soon as she could command her voice.  'Robbie and baby were so hungry, and I hadn't got anythink to give 'em.'",glad say little command voice hungry get anythink give 
23,"'I suppose you aint hungry yourself neither,' observed Mrs Blossom, a tear rolling down a little channel between her round cheeks and her nose.",suppose hungry observe tear roll little channel round cheek nose 
24,"'Oh, but ain't I!' said Meg, recovering herself still more.  'I've had nothink since last night, and then it were only a crust as Kitty give me.'",say recover more have nothink last night crust give 
25,"'Well, dear, fall to, and welcome,' answered Mrs Blossom.  'And who's Kitty?'",dear fall answer 
26,"'It's a grown-up person as lives in the back attic,' answered Meg, after eating her first mouthful.  'She helps me all she can.  She's took all my things to the pawn-shop for me, because she can get more money than me.  She's as good as can be to us.'",grow person live back attic answer eat first mouthful help take thing pawn shop get more money good 
27,'Are all your things gone to pawn?' inquired Mrs Blossom.,thing go pawn inquire 
28,"'I've got baby's cloak and hood left,' she replied mournfully.  'He wouldn't give more than a shilling for 'em, and I thought it wasn't worth while parting with 'em for that.  I tried to keep Robbie's cap and pinafore, that were as good as new, but I were forced to let 'em go.  And our shoes, ma'am,' added Meg, taking Robin's bare and bleeding foot into her hand: 'see what poor Robbie's done to himself.'",get baby cloak hood leave reply give more shilling think worth part try keep cap pinafore good new force let go shoe ma'am add take bare bleeding foot hand see poor do 
29,"'Poor little dear!' said Mrs Blossom pityingly.  'I'll wash his poor little feet for him when he's finished his dinner.  You get on with yours likewise, my love.'",poor little dear say wash poor little foot finish dinner get love 
30,"Meg was silent for some minutes, busily feasting on the hot tripe, and basking in the agreeable warmth of the cosy room.  It was a wonderfully bright little spot for that quarter of London, but the brightness was all inside.  Outside, at about three feet from the window, rose a wall so high as to shut out every glimpse of the sky; but within everything was so clean and shining, even to the quarried floor, that it was difficult to believe in the mud and dirt of the streets without.  Mrs Blossom herself looked fresh and comely, like a countrywoman; but there was a sad expression on her round face, plain enough to be seen when she was not talking.",silent minute feast hot tripe bask agreeable warmth cosy room bright little spot quarter brightness foot window rise wall high shut glimpse sky clean shine quarry floor difficult believe mud dirt street look fresh countrywoman be sad expression round face plain see talk 
31,"'My dear,' she said when Meg laid down her knife and fork, and assured her earnestly that she could eat no more, 'what may you be thinking of doing?'",dear say lay knife fork assure eat more think do 
32,"'I don't hardly know,' she answered.  'I expect father home every day. If I could only get enough for the children, and a crust or two for me, we could get along.  But we can't do nothink more, I know.'",know answer expect father home day get enough child crust get do more know 
33,"'You'll be forced to go into the house,' said Mrs Blossom.",force go house say 
34,"'Oh, no, no, no!' cried little Meg, drawing Robin to her, and with a great effort lifting him on to her lap, where he almost eclipsed her. 'I couldn't ever do that.  We'll get along somehow till father comes home.'",cry little draw great effort lift lap eclipse do get father come 
35,'Where is it you live?' inquired Mrs Blossom.,live inquire 
36,"'Oh, it's not a nice place at all,' said Meg, who dreaded having any visitor.  'It's along Rosemary Lane, and down a street, and then down another smaller street, and up a court.  That's where it is.'",nice place say dread have visitor street small street court 
37,"Mrs Blossom sat meditating a few minutes, with the baby on her lap, stretching itself lazily and contentedly before the fire; while Meg, from behind Robin, watched her new friend's face anxiously.",sit meditate few minute baby lap stretch fire watch new friend face 
38,"'Well,' she said, 'you come here again to-morrow, and I'll ask Mr George what's to be done.  That was Mr George as was here, and he's my lodger.  He took you in, and maybe he'll agree to do something.'",say come ask do lodger take agree do 
39,"'Thank you, ma'am,' said Meg gratefully.  'Please, have you any little children of your own?'",thank say have little child own 
40,"The tears ran faster now down Mrs Blossom's cheeks, and she was obliged to wipe them away before she could answer.",tear run fast cheek oblige wipe answer 
41,"'I'd a little girl like you,' she said, 'ten years ago.  Such a pretty little girl, so rosy, and bright, and merry, as all the folks round took notice of.  She was like the apple of my eye, she was.'",little girl say year little girl rosy bright merry folk take notice apple eye 
42,"'What was she called?' asked Meg, with an eager interest.",call ask eager interest 
43,"'Why, the neighbours called her Posy because her name was Blossom,' said Mrs Blossom, smiling amidst her tears.  'We lived out in the country, and I'd a little shop, and a garden, and kept fowls, and pigs, and eggs; fresh eggs, such as the like are never seen in this part o' London.  Posy they called her, and a real posy she was.'",neighbour call name say smile tear live country little shop garden keep fowl pig egg fresh egg such like see part posy call real posy 
44,"Mrs Blossom paused, and looked sadly down upon the happy baby, shaking her head as if she was sorely grieved at heart.",pause look happy baby shake head grieve heart 
45,'And Posy died?' said Meg softly.,die say 
46,"'No, no!' cried Mrs Blossom.  'It 'ud been a hundred times better if she'd died.  She grew up bad.  I hope you'll never live to grow up bad, little girl.  And she ran away from home; and I lost her, her own mother that had nursed her when she was a little baby like this.  I'd ha' been thankful to ha' seen her lying dead afore my eyes in her coffin.'",cry time good die grow bad hope live grow bad little girl run home lose own mother nurse little baby thankful see lie dead eye coffin 
47,"'That's bad,' said little Meg, in a tone of trouble and tender pity.",bad say little tone trouble tender pity 
48,"'It's nigh upon three years ago,' continued Mrs Blossom, looking down still upon the baby, as if she were telling her; 'and I gave up my shop to my son's wife, and come here, thinking maybe she'd step in some day or other to buy a loaf of bread or something, because I knew she'd come up to London.  But she's never so much as passed by the window--leastways when I've been watching, and I'm always watching.  I can't do my duty by Mr George for staring out o' the window.'",nigh year continue look baby tell give shop son wife come think step day other buy loaf bread know come much pass window leastway watch watch do duty stare window

52,"'Ay, my dear,' said Mrs Blossom.  'I ask Him every blessed day o' my life.'",dear say ask bless day life 
53,"'Then she's sure to come some day,' said Meg joyfully.  'There's no mistake about that, because Jesus says it in the Bible, and He knows all about God.  You've asked Him, and He'll do it.  It's like father coming.  I don't know whether he'll come to-day or to-morrow, or when it'll be; but he will come.'",sure come day say be mistake say know ask do father come know come day come 
54,"'God bless and love you!' cried Mrs Blossom, suddenly putting baby down in Meg's lap, and clasping all three of them in her arms.  'I'll believe it, I will.  He's sent you to give me more heart.  God love you all!'",bless love cry put baby lap clasp arm believe send give more heart love 
55,"It was some while before Mrs Blossom regained her composure; but when she did, and it was time for Meg and the children to go home before it was quite dark, she bound up Robin's foot in some rags, and gave Meg a loaf to carry home with her, bidding her be sure to come again the next day.  Meg looked back to the shop many times before turning the corner of the street, and saw Mrs Blossom's round face, with its white cap border, still leaning over the door, looking after them, and nodding pleasantly each time she caught Meg's backward glance.  At the corner they all three turned round, Meg holding up baby as high as her arms could reach, and after this last farewell they lost sight of their new friend.",while regain composure time child go dark bind foot rag give loaf carry bid sure come next day look shop many time turn corner street see round face white cap border lean door look nodd time catch backward glance corner turn hold baby high arm reach last farewell lose sight new friend
