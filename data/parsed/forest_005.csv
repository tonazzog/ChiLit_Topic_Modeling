1,CHAPTER V.,
2," As we have before said, time passed rapidly; with the exception of one or two excursions after venison, they remained in the cottage, and Jacob never went to Lymington. The frost had broken up, the snow had long disappeared, and the trees began to bud. The sun became powerful, and in the month of May the forest began again to look green.",say time pass exception excursion venison remain cottage go frost break snow disappear tree begin be sun become powerful month forest begin look green 
3,"""And now, Edward,"" said Jacob Armitage, one day at breakfast, ""we will try for venison again to sell at Lymington, for I must purchase Humphrey's cart and harness; so let us get our guns, and go out this fine morning. The stags are mostly by themselves at this season, for the does are with their young calves. We must find the slot of a deer, and track him to his lair, and you shall have the first shot if you like; but, that, however, depends more upon the deer than upon me.""",say day breakfast try venison sell purchase cart harness let get gun go fine morning stag season young calve find slot deer track lair have first shot like depend deer 
4,"They had walked four or five miles when they came upon the slot or track of a deer, but Jacob's practiced eye pointed out to Edward that it was the slot of a young one, and not worth following. He explained to Edward the difference in the hoof-marks and other signs by which this knowledge was gained, and they proceeded onward until they found another slot, which Jacob declared to be that of a warrantable stag--that is, one old enough to kill and to be good venison.",walk mile come slot track deer practice eye point slot young one worth follow explain difference hoof mark other sign knowledge gain proceed find slot declare warrantable stag old kill good venison 
5,"""We must now track him to his lair, Edward.""",track lair 
6,"This took them about a mile farther, when they arrived at a small thicket of thorns about an acre in extent.",take mile far arrive small thicket thorn acre extent 
7,"""Here he is, you see, Edward; let me now see if he is harbored.""",see let see harbor 
8,"They walked round the thicket, and could not find any slot or track by which the stag had left the covert, and Jacob pronounced that the animal must be hid in it.",walk thicket find slot track stag leave covert pronounce animal hide 
9,"""Now, Edward, do you stay here while I go back to the lee side of the covert: I will enter it with Smoker, and the stag will, in all probability, when he is roused, come out to breast the wind. You will then have a good shot at him; recollect to fire so as to hit him behind the shoulder: if he is moving quick, fire a little before the shoulders; if slow, take aim accurately; but recollect, if I come upon him in the covert, I shall kill him if I can, for we want the venison, and then we will go after another to give you a chance.""",stay go side covert enter stag probability rouse come breast wind have good shot recollect fire hit shoulder move fire little shoulder slow take aim recollect come covert kill want venison go give chance 
10,"Jacob then left Edward, and went down to the lee side of the covert, where he entered it with Smoker. Edward was stationed behind a thorn-bush, which grew a few yards clear of the covert, and he soon heard the creaking of the branches.",leave go side covert enter station thorn bush grow few yard clear covert hear creaking branch 
11,"A short time elapsed, and a fine stag came out at a trot; he turned his head, and was just bounding away when Edward fired, and the animal fell. Remembering the advice of Jacob, Edward remained where he was, in silence reloading his piece, and was soon afterward joined by Jacob and the dog.",short time elapse fine stag come trot turn head bound fire animal fall remember advice remain silence reload piece join dog 
12,"""Well done, Edward!"" said the forester, in a low voice; and, covering his forehead to keep off the glare of the sun, he looked earnestly at a high brake between some thorn-trees, about a half a mile to the windward. ""I think I see something there--look Edward, your eyes are younger than mine. Is that the branch of a tree in the fern, or is it not?""",do say forester low voice cover forehead keep glare sun look high brake thorn tree mile windward think see look eye young branch tree fern 
13,"""I see what you mean,"" replied Edward. ""It is not, it moves.""",see mean reply move 
14,"""I thought so, but my eyes are not so good as they once were. It's another stag, depend upon it; but how are we to get near him? We never can get across this patch of clear grass without being seen.""",think eye good stag depend get get patch clear grass see 
15,"""No, we can not get at him from this spot,"" replied Edward; ""but if we were to fall back to leeward, and gain the forest again, I think that there are thorns sufficient from the forest to where he lies, to creep from behind one to the other, so as to get a shot at him, don't you?""",get spot reply fall leeward gain forest think be thorn sufficient forest lie creep other get shot 
16,"""It will require care and patience to manage that; but I think it might be done. I will try it; it is my turn now, you know. You had better stay here with the dog, for only one can hide from thorn to thorn.""",require care patience manage think do try turn know have good stay dog hide thorn thorn 
17,"Jacob, ordering Smoker to remain, then set off. He had to make a circuit of three miles to get to the spot where the thorns extended from the forest, and Edward saw no more of him, although he strained his eyes, until the stag sprung out, and the gun was discharged. Edward perceived that the stag was not killed, but severely wounded, running toward the covert near which he was hid. ""Down, Smoker,"" said he, as he cocked his gun. The stag came within shot, and was coming nearer, when, seeing Edward, it turned. Edward fired, and then cheered on the dog, who sprung after the wounded animal, giving tongue, as he followed him. Edward, perceiving Jacob hastening toward him, waited for him.",order smoker remain set have make circuit mile get spot thorn extend forest see more strain eye stag spring gun discharge perceive stag kill wound run covert hide say cocked gun stag come shot come see turn fire cheer dog spring wound animal give tongue follow perceive hasten wait

21,"They hastened on another quarter of a mile, when they found that the stag had fallen on his knees, and had been seized by the throat by Smoker.",hasten quarter mile find stag fall knee seize throat 
22,"""Mind, Edward, now, how I go up to him, for the wound from the horn of the deer is very dangerous.""",mind go wound horn deer dangerous 
23,"Jacob advanced from behind the stag, and cut his throat with his hunting-knife. ""He is a fine beast, and we have done well to-day, but we shall have two journeys to make to get all this venison home. I could not get a fair shot at him--and see, I have hit him here in the flank.""",advance stag cut throat hunting knife fine beast do day have journey make get venison home get fair shot see hit flank 
24,"""And here is my ball in his throat,"" said Edward.",ball throat say 
25,"""So it is. Then it was a good shot that you made, and you are master of the hunt this day, Edward. Now, I'll remain, and you go home for White Billy. Humphrey is right about the cart. If we had one, we could have carried all home at once; but I must go now and cut the throat of the other stag which you killed so cleverly. You will be a good hunter one of these days, Edward. A little more knowledge, and a little more practice, and I will leave it all to you, and hang up my gun over the chimney.""",good shot make master hunt day remain go white right cart have carry home go cut throat other stag kill good hunter day little more knowledge little more practice leave hang gun chimney 
26,"It was late in the evening before they had made their two trips and taken all the venison home, and very tired were they before it was safely housed. Edward was delighted with his success, but not more so than was old Jacob. The next morning, Jacob set off for Lymington, with the pony loaded with venison, which he sold, as well as two more loads which he promised to bring the next day, and the day after. He then looked out for a cart, and was fortunate in finding a small one, just fitted to the size of the pony, who was not tall but very strong, as all the New Forest ponies are. He also procured harness, and then put Billy in the cart to draw him home; but Billy did not admire being put in a cart, and for some time was very restive, and backed and reared, and went every way but the right; but by dint of coaxing and leading, he at last submitted, and went straight on; but then the noise of the cart behind him frightened him, and he ran away. At last, having tired himself out, he thought that he might as well go quietly in harness, as he could not get out of it; and he did so, and arrived safe at the cottage. Humphrey was delighted at the sight of the cart, and said that now they should get on well. The next day, Jacob contrived to put all the remainder of the venison in the cart, and White Billy made no more difficulty; he dragged it all to Lymington, and returned with the cart as quietly and cleverly as if he had been in harness all his life.",late evening make trip take venison home tired house delighted success old next morning set pony load venison sell more load promise bring next day day look cart fortunate find small one fit size pony tall strong new pony procure harness put cart draw admire put cart time restive back rear go way right dint coax lead submit go noise cart frighten run last tired think go harness get arrive safe cottage delight sight cart say get next day contrive put remainder venison cart make more difficulty drag return cart harness life 
27,"""Well, Edward, the venison paid for the cart at all events,"" said Jacob, ""and now, I will tell you all the news I collected while I was at Lymington. Captain Burly, who attempted to incite the people to rescue the king, has been hung, drawn, and quartered, as a traitor.""",venison pay cart event say tell news collect attempt incite person rescue king hang draw quarter traitor

32,Edward remained very grave for some time.,remain grave time

34,"Here the conversation ended, and they went to bed.",conversation end go bed 
35,"This was now a busy time at the cottage. The manure had to be got out of the stable and pigsties, and carried out to the potato-ground and garden; the crops had to be put in, and the cart was now found valuable. After the manure had been carried out and spread, Edward and Humphrey helped Jacob to dig the ground, and then to put in the seed. The cabbage-plants of last year were then put out, and the turnips and carrots sown. Before the month was over, the garden and potato-field were cropped, and Humphrey took upon himself to weed and keep it clean. Little Edith had also employment now, for the hens began to lay eggs, and as soon as she heard them cackling, she ran for the eggs and brought them in; and before the month was over, Jacob had set four hens upon eggs. Billy, the pony, was now turned out to graze in the forest; he came home every night of his own accord.",busy time cottage manure have get stable pigsty carry potato ground garden crop have put cart find valuable manure carry spread help dig ground put seed cabbage plant last year put turnip carrot sow month garden potato field croppe take weed keep clean little have employment hen begin lay egg hear cackle run egg bring month set hen egg pony turn graze forest come night own accord

38,"""Whose cows are those which I see in the forest sometimes?"" said Humphrey to Jacob.",cow see forest say 
39,"""If they belong to any body, they belong to the king,"" replied Jacob; ""but they are cattle which have strayed and found their way to the forest, and have remained here ever since. They are rather wild and savage, and you must be careful how you go too near them, as the bulls will run at you. They increase very fast: there were but six a few years ago, and now there are at least fifty in the herd.""",belong body belong king reply cattle stray find way forest remain wild savage careful go bull run increase be few year be least herd

42,"""I don't want a bull,"" replied Humphrey, ""but a cow would give us milk, and then we should have more manure for the garden. My garden will then grow more potatoes.""",want bull reply cow give milk have more manure garden garden grow more potato 
43,"""Well, Humphrey, if you can catch a cow, no one will interfere; but I think you will not find it very easy, and you may find it very dangerous.""",catch cow interfere think find easy find dangerous 
44,"""I'll look out for one,"" replied Humphrey, ""any how. Alice, if we only had a cow, wouldn't that be jolly?""",look reply have cow jolly 
45,"The crops were now all up, and as the days began to be long, the work became comparatively light and easy. Humphrey was busy making a little wheelbarrow for Edith, that she might barrow away the weeds as he hoed them up; and at last this great performance was completed, much to the admiration of all, and much to his own satisfaction. Indeed, when it is recollected that Humphrey had only the hand-saw and ax, and that he had to cut down the tree; and then to saw it into plank, it must be acknowledged that it required great patience and perseverance even to make a wheelbarrow; but Humphrey was not only persevering, but was full of invention. He had built up a hen-house with fir-poles, and made the nests for the hens to lay and hatch in, and they now had between forty and fifty chickens running about. He had also divided the pigsty, so that the sow might be kept apart from the other pigs; and they expected very soon to have a litter of young pigs. He had transplanted the wild strawberries from the forest, and had, by manure, made them large and good; and he had also a fine crop of onions in the garden, from seed which Jacob had bought at Lymington; now Humphrey was very busy cutting down some poles in the forest to make a cow-house, for he declared that he would have a cow somehow or another. June arrived, and it was time to mow down grass to make into hay for the winter, and Jacob had two scythes. He showed the boys how to use them, and they soon became expert; and as there was plenty of long grass at this time of the year, and they could mow when they pleased, they soon had White Billy in full employment carrying the hay home. The little girls helped to make it, for Humphrey had made them two rakes. Jacob thought that there was hay enough made, but Humphrey said that there was enough for the pony, but not enough for the cow.",crop day begin long work become light easy busy make little wheelbarrow barrow weed ho last great performance complete much admiration much own satisfaction recollect have hand saw ax have cut tree see plank acknowledge require great patience perseverance make wheelbarrow persever full invention build hen house fir pole make nest hen lay hatch have chicken run divide pigsty sow keep other pig expect have litter young pig transplant wild strawberry forest manure make large good have fine crop onion garden seed buy busy cut pole forest make cow house declare have cow arrive time mow grass make hay winter have scythe show boy use become expert be plenty long grass time year mow pleased have white full employment carry hay home little girl help make make rake think be hay make say be enough pony enough cow 
46,"""But where is the cow to come from, Humphrey?""",cow come 
47,"""Where the venison comes from,"" replied he: ""out of the forest.""",venison come reply forest 
48,"So Humphrey continued to mow and make hay, while Edward and Jacob went out for venison. After all the hay was made and stacked, Humphrey found out a method of thatching with fern, which Jacob had never thought of; and when that was done, they commenced cutting down fern for fodder. Here again Humphrey would have twice as much as Jacob had ever cut before, because he wanted litter for the cow. At last it became quite a joke between him and Edward, who, when he brought home more venison than would keep in the hot weather, told Humphrey that the remainder was for the cow. Still Humphrey would not give up the point, and every morning and evening he would be certain to be absent an hour or two, and it was found out he was watching the herd of wild cattle who were feeding: sometimes they were very near, at others a long way off. He used to get up into the trees, and examine them as they passed under him without perceiving him. One night Humphrey returned very late, and the next morning he was off before daylight. Breakfast was over, and Humphrey did not make his appearance, and they could not tell what was the matter. Jacob felt uneasy, but Edward laughed, and said:",continue mow make hay go venison hay make stack find method thatch fern think do commence cut fern fodder have much cut want litter cow last become joke bring more venison keep hot weather tell remainder cow give point morning evening certain absent hour find watch herd wild cattle feed other long way use get tree examine pass perceive night return next morning daylight breakfast make appearance tell matter feel uneasy laugh say

58,"""Well, I suppose you'll tell us now what we are going for?"" said Edward.",suppose tell go say 
59,"""Yes, I will. You know I've been watching the cattle for a long while, because I wanted a cow. I have been in a tree when they have passed under me several times, and I observed that one or two of the heifers were very near calving. Yesterday evening I thought one could not help calving very soon indeed, and as I was watching, I saw that she was uneasy, and that she at last left the herd and went into a little copse of wood. I remained three hours to see if she came out again, and she did not. It was dark when I came home, as you know. This morning I went before daylight and found the herd. She is very remarkable, being black and white spotted; and, after close examination, I found that she was not with the herd; so I am sure that she went into the copse to calve, and that she has calved before this.""",know watch cattle long while want cow tree pass several time observe heifer calve yesterday evening think help calve watch see uneasy leave herd go little copse wood remain hour see come dark come know morning go daylight find herd remarkable black white spot close examination find herd sure go copse calve calve

I have got Smoker to worry the heifer and keep her employed, while we put the calf in the cart; a rope that we may tie the cow if we can; and you with your guns must keep off the herd if they come to her assistance.

64,"""Not half a mile farther,"" replied Humphrey. ""We shall soon be there.""",mile reply 
65,"On their arrival, they found that the herd were feeding at a considerable distance from the copse, which was, perhaps, as well.",arrival find herd feed considerable distance copse 
66,"""Now,"" said Jacob, ""I and Edward will enter into the copse with Smoker, and you follow us, Humphrey. I will make Smoker seize the heifer, if necessary; at all events he will keep her at bay--that is, if she is here. First, let us walk round the copse and find her _slot_, as we call the track of a deer. See, here is her footing. Now let us go in.""",say enter copse follow make seize heifer necessary event keep bay let walk copse find _slot_ call track deer see footing let go 
67,"They advanced cautiously into the thicket, following the track of the heifer, and at last came upon her. Apparently she had not calved more than an hour, and was licking the calf, which was not yet on its legs. As soon as the animal perceived Jacob and Edward, she shook her head, and was about to run at them; but Jacob told Smoker to seize her, and the dog flew at her immediately. The attack of the dog drove back the heifer quite into the thicket, and as the dog bounded round her, springing this way and that way to escape her horns, the heifer was soon separated from the calf.",advance thicket follow track heifer last come calve more hour lick calf leg animal perceive shake head about run tell seize dog fly attack dog drive heifer thicket dog bound spring way way escape horn heifer separate calf

69,"The boys put their arms under the stomach of the calf, and carried it away. The heifer was at first too busy defending herself against the dog to perceive that the calf was gone; when she did, Jacob called Smoker to him, so as to bring him between the heifer and where the boys were going out of the thicket. At last the heifer gave a loud bellow, and rushed out of the thicket in pursuit of her calf, checked by Smoker, who held on to her ear, and sometimes stopped her from advancing.",boy put arm stomach calf carry heifer first busy defend dog perceive calf gone call bring heifer boy go thicket last heifer give loud bellow rush thicket pursuit calf check hold ear stop advance

75,"Humphrey, who had the reins, drove off; the heifer followed, at one time running at the dog, at another putting her head almost into the hind part of the cart; but the lowing of the heifer was now answered by deeper tones, and Jacob said,",have rein drive heifer follow time run dog put head hind part cart lowing heifer answer deep tone say

87,"Alice and Edith hearing this, and Edward also crying out to them, made a hasty retreat to the cottage. Humphrey then backed the cart against the paling of the yard, so as to enable Edward to get on the other side of it, ready to open the gate. Smoker was set at the heifer, and, as before, soon engaged her attention; so that the gate was opened and the cart drove in, and the gate closed again, before the heifer could follow.",hear cry make hasty retreat cottage back cart paling yard enable get other side ready open gate smoker set heifer engage attention gate open cart drive gate close heifer follow
