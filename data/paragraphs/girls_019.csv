1,CHAPTER 19. CUP AND BALL.
2,"Just toward the end of the Easter holidays, Hester Thornton was thrown into a great tumult of excitement, of wonder, of half regret and half joy, by a letter which she received from her father.  In this letter he informed her that he had made up his mind to break up his establishment for several years, to go abroad, and to leave Hester altogether under Mrs Willis's care."
3,"When Hester had read so far, she flung her letter on the table, put her head into her hands, and burst into tears."
4,"""Oh, how cruel of father!"" she exclaimed; ""how am I to live without ever going home--how am I to endure life without seeing my little Nan?"""
5,"Hester cried bitterly; the strongest love of her nature was now given to this pretty and sweet little sister, and dismal pictures rose rapidly before her of Nan growing up without in the least remembering her-- perhaps, still worse, of Nan being unkindly treated and neglected by strangers.  After a long pause, she raised her head, wiped her eyes, and resumed her letter.  Now, indeed, she started with astonishment, and gave an exclamation of delight--Sir John Thornton had arranged that Mrs Willis was also to receive little Nan, although she was younger than any other child present in the school.  Hester scarcely waited to finish her letter.  She crammed it into her pocket, rushed up to Susan Drummond, and astonished that placid young lady by suddenly kissing her."
6,"""Nan is coming, Susy!"" she exclaimed; ""dear, darling, lovely little Nan is coming--oh, I am so happy!"""
7,"She was far too impatient to explain matters to stolid Susan, and danced downstairs, her eyes sparkling and smiles on her lips.  It was nothing to her now how long she stayed at school--her heart's treasure would be with her there, and she could not but feel happy."
8,"After breakfast Mrs Willis sent for her, and told her what arrangements were being made; she said that she was going to remove Susan Drummond out of Hester's bedroom, in order that Hester might enjoy her little sister's company at night.  She spoke very gently, and entered with full sympathy into the girl's delight over the little motherless sister, and Hester felt more drawn to her governess than she had ever been."
9,"Nan was to arrive at Lavender House on the following evening, and for the first week her nurse was to remain with her until she got accustomed to her new life."
10,"The morning of the day of Nan's arrival was also the last of the Easter holidays, and Hester, awakening earlier than her wont, lay in bed, and planned what she would do to welcome the little one."
11,"The idea of having Nan with her continually had softened and touched Hester.  She was not unhappy in her school-life--indeed, there was much in its monotonous, busy, and healthy occupation to stimulate and rouse the good in her.  Her intellect was being vigorously exercised, and, by contact with her school-fellows, her character was being moulded; but the perfect harmony and brightness of the school had been much interrupted since Hester's arrival; her dislike to Annie Forest had been unfortunate in more ways than one, and that dislike, which was increasing each day, was hardening Hester's heart."
12,"But it was not hard this morning--all that was sweetest, and softest, and best in her had come to the surface--the little sister, whom her mother had left in her charge, was now to be her daily and hourly companion.  For Nan's sake, then, she must be very good; her deeds must be gentle and kind, and her thoughts charitable.  Hester had an instinctive feeling that baby eyes saw deep below the surface; Hester felt if Nan were to lose even a shadow of her faith in her she could almost die of shame."
13,"Hester had been very proud of Dora Russell's friendship.  Never before had it been known in the school that a first-class girl took a third into such close companionship, and Hester's little head had been slightly turned by the fact.  Her better judgment and her better nature had been rather blinded by the fascinations of this tall, graceful, satirical Dora.  She had been weak enough to agree with Dora with her lips when in her heart of hearts she knew she was all wrong.  By nature Hester was an honourable girl, with many fine traits in her character-- by nature Dora was small and mean and poor of soul."
14,This morning Hester ran up to her favourite.
15,"""Little Nan is coming to-night,"" she said."
16,"Dora was talking at the moment to Miss Maitland, another first-class girl, and the two stared rather superciliously at Hester, and, after a pause, Dora said in her finest drawl--"
17,"""Who _is_ little Nan?"""
18,"It was Hester's turn to stare, for she had often spoken of Nan to this beloved friend, who had listened to her narrative and had appeared to sympathise."
19,"""My little sister, of course,"" she exclaimed.  ""I have often talked to you about her, Dora.  Are you not glad she is coming?"""
20,"""No, my dear child, I can't say that I am.  If you wish to retain my friendship, Hester, you must be careful to keep the little mite away from me; I can't bear small children."""
21,"Hester walked away with her heart swelling, and she fancied she heard the two elder girls laughing as she left the play-room."
22,"Many other girls, however, in the school thoroughly sympathised with Hester, and amongst them no one was more delighted than Susan Drummond."
23,"""I am awfully good-natured not to be as cross as two sticks, Hetty,"" she exclaimed, ""for I am being turned out of my comfortable room; and whose room do you suppose I am now to share? why, that little imp Annie Forest's.""  But Hester felt charitable, even toward Annie, on this happy day."
24,"In the evening little Nan arrived.  She was a very pretty, dimpled, brown-eyed creature, of just three years of age.  She had all the imperious ways of a spoilt baby, and, evidently, fear was a word not to be found in her vocabulary.  She clung to Hester, but smiled and nodded to the other girls, who made advances to her, and petted her, and thought her a very charming baby.  Beside Nan, all the other little girls in the school looked old.  She was quite, two years the youngest, and it was soon very evident that she would establish that most imperious of all reigns--a baby reign--in the school."
25,"Hester fondled her and talked to her, and the little thing sat on her knee and stroked her face."
26,"""Me like 'oo, Hetty,"" she said several times, and she added many other endearing and pretty words which caused Hester's heart to swell with delight.  She alone, of all the girls, had taken no notice of the new plaything.  She walked to her usual corner, sat down on the floor, and began to play cup and ball for the benefit of two or three of the smallest children.  Hester did not regard her in the least; she sat with Nan on her knee, stroking back her sunny curls, and remarking on her various charms to several of the girls who sat round her."
27,"""See, how pretty that dimple in her chin is,"" she said, ""and oh, my pet, your eyes look wiser, and bigger, and saucier than ever.  Look at me, Nan; look at your own Hetty."""
28,"Nan's attention, however, was diverted by the gayly-painted cup and ball which Annie was using with her wonted dexterity."
29,"""Dat a pitty toy,"" she said, giving one quick and rather solemn glance at her sister, and again fixing her admiring gaze on the cup and ball."
30,"Annie Forest had heard the words, and she darted a sudden, laughing look at the little one.  Annie's power over children was well-known.  Nan began to wriggle on Hester's knee."
31,"""Dat a pitty lady,"" she said again, ""and dat a pitty, tibby [little] toy; Nan go see."""
32,"In an instant, before Hester could prevent her, she had trotted across the room, and was kneeling with the other children and shouting with delight over Annie's play."
33,"""She'll get her, you'll see, Hester,"" said one of the girls maliciously; ""she'll soon be much fonder of Annie Forest than of you.  Annie wins the heart of every little child in the school."""
34,"""She won't win my Nan's from me,"" said Hester in a confident tone; but in spite of her words a great pang of jealousy had gone through her. She rose to her feet and followed her little sister."
35,"""Nan, you are sleepy, you must go to bed."""
36,"""No, no, Hetty; me not s'eepy, me kite awake; go 'way, Hetty, Nan want to see the pitty tibby toy."""
37,"Annie raised her eyes to Hester's.  She did not really want to be unkind, and at that moment it had certainly never entered into her head to steal Hester's treasure from her, but she could not help a look of suppressed delight and triumph filling her eyes."
38,"Hester could scarcely bear the look; she stooped down, and taking one of Nan's little dimpled hands tried to drag her away."
39,Instantly Annie threw the cup and ball on the floor.
40,"""The play is all over to-night, little darling,"" she said; ""give Annie Forest one kiss, and run to bed with sister Hester."""
41,"Nan, who had been puckering up her face to cry, smiled instantly; then she scrambled to her feet, and flung her little fat arms round Annie's neck."
42,"""Dat a vedy pitty p'ay,"" she said in a patronising tone, ""and me like 'oo, me do."""
43,"Then she gave her hand willingly to Hester, and trotted out of the play-room by her side."
