1,CHAPTER 64.
2,"The second day was passed in keeping a look-out upon the savages, and awaiting a fresh attack.  They could perceive from the top of the cocoa-nut tree that the savages held a council of war in the forenoon, sitting round in a large circle, while one got up in the centre and made a speech, flourishing his club and spear while he spoke.  In the afternoon the council broke up, and the savages were observed to be very busy in all directions, cutting down the cocoa-nut trees, and collecting all the brushwood."
3,"Ready watched them for a long while, and at last came down a little before sunset.  ""Mr Seagrave,"" said he, ""we shall have, in my opinion, no attack this night, but to-morrow we must expect something very serious; the savages are cutting down the trees, and making large faggots; they do not get on very fast, because their hatchets are made of stone and don't cut very well, but perseverance and numbers will effect everything, and I dare say that they will work all night till they have obtained as many faggots as they want."""
4,"""But what do you imagine to be their object, Ready, in cutting down trees, and making the faggots?"""
5,"""Either, sir, to pile them up outside the palisades, so large as to be able to walk up upon them, or else to pile them up to set fire to them, and burn us out."""
6,"""Do you think they will succeed?"""
7,"""Not without very heavy loss; perhaps we may best them off, but it will be a hard fight; harder than any we have had yet.  We must have the women to load the muskets, so that we may fire as fast as we can.  I should not think much of their attempt to burn us, if it were not for the smoke.  Cocoa-nut wood, especially with the bark on, as our palisades have, will char a long while, but not burn easily when standing upright; and the fire, when the faggots are kindled, although it will be fierce, will not last long."""
8,"""But suffering as we are now, Ready, for want of water, how can we possibly keep up our strength to meet them in a suffocating smoke and flame? we must drop with sheer exhaustion."""
9,"""We must hope for the best, and do our best, Mr Seagrave,"" replied Ready; ""and recollect that should anything happen to me during the conflict, and if there is any chance of your being overpowered, you must take advantage of the smoke to escape into the woods, and find your way to the tents.  I have no doubt that you will be able to do that; of course the attack will be to windward if they use fire, and you must try and escape to leeward; I have shown William how to force a palisade if necessary.  The savages, if they get possession, will not think of looking for you at first, and, perhaps, when they have obtained all that the house contains, not even afterwards."""
10,"""Why do you say if any accident happens to you, Ready?"" said William."
11,"""Because, William, if they place the faggots so as to be able to walk to the top of the palisades, I may be wounded or killed, and so may you."""
12,"""Of course,"" replied William; ""but they are not in yet, and they shall have a hard fight for it."""
13,"Ready then told Mr Seagrave that he would keep the watch, and call him at twelve o'clock.  During these two days, they had eaten very little; a turtle had been killed, and pieces fried, but eating only added to their thirst, and even the children refused the meat.  The sufferings were now really dreadful, and poor Mrs Seagrave was almost frantic."
14,"As soon as Mr Seagrave had gone into the house, Ready called William, and said, ""William, water we must have.  I cannot bear to see the agony of the poor children, and the state of mind which your poor mother is in; and more, without water we never shall be able to beat off the savages to-morrow.  We shall literally die of choking in the smoke, if they use fire.  Now, William, I intend to take one of the seven-gallon barricos, and go down to the well for water.  I may succeed, and I may not, but attempt it I must, and if I fall it cannot be helped."""
15,"""Why not let me go, Ready?"" replied William."
16,"""For many reasons, William,"" said Ready; ""and the chief one is that I do not think you would succeed so well as I shall.  I shall put on the war-cloak and feathers of the savage who fell dead inside of the stockade, and that will be a disguise, but I shall take no arms except his spear, as they would only be in my way, and increase the weight I have to carry.  Now observe, you must let me out of the door, and when I am out, in case of accident put one of the poles across it inside; that will keep the door fast, if they attack it, until you can secure it with the others.  Watch my return, and be all ready to let me in.  Do you understand me?"""
17,"""Yes, perfectly, Ready; but I am now, I must confess, really frightened; if anything was to happen to you, what a misery it would be!"""
18,"""There is no help for it, William.  Water must, if possible, be procured, and now is a better time to make the attempt than later, when they may be more on the watch; they have left off their work, and are busy eating; if I meet any one, it will only be a woman."""
19,"Ready went for the barrico, a little cask, which held six or seven gallons of water.  He put on the head-dress and war-cloak of the savage; and, taking the barrico on his shoulder, and the spear in his hand, the poles which barred the door were softly removed by William, and after ascertaining that no one was concealed beneath the palisades, Ready pressed William's hand, and set off across the cleared space outside of the stockade, and gained the cocoa-nut trees.  William, as directed, closed the door, passed one pole through the inner door-posts for security, and remained on the watch.  He was in an awful state of suspense, listening to the slightest noise, even the slight rustling by the wind of the cocoa-nut boughs above him made him start; there he continued for some minutes, his gun ready cocked by his side."
20,"It is time that he returned, thought William; the distance is not 100 yards, and yet I have heard no noise.  At last he thought he heard footsteps coming very softly.  Yes, it was so.  Ready was returning, and without any accident.  William had his hand upon the pole, to slip it on one side and open the door, when he heard a scuffle and a fall close to the door.  He immediately threw down the pole, and opened it just as Ready called him by name.  William seized his musket and sprang out; he found Ready struggling with a savage, who was uppermost, and with his spear at Ready's breast.  In a second William levelled and fired, and the savage fell dead."
21,"""Take the water in quick, William,"" said Ready in a faint voice.  ""I will contrive to crawl in if I can."""
22,"William caught up the barrico of water, and took it in; he then hastened to Ready, who was on his knees.  Mr Seagrave, hearing the musket fired, had run out, and finding the stockade door open, followed William, and seeing him endeavouring to support Ready, caught hold of his other arm, and they led him tottering into the stockade; the door was then immediately secured, and they went to his assistance."
23,"""Are you hurt, Ready?"" said William."
24,"""Yes, dear boy, yes; hurt to death, I fear: his spear went through my breast.  Water, quick, water!"""
25,"""Alas! that we had some,"" said Mr Seagrave."
26,"""We have, papa,"" replied William; ""but it has cost us dearly."""
27,"William ran for a pannikin, and taking out the bung, poured some water out of the barrico and gave it to Ready, who drank it with eagerness."
28,"""Now, William, lay me down on these cocoa-nut boughs; go and give some water to the others, and when you have all drunk, then come to me again. Don't tell Mrs Seagrave that I'm hurt.  Do as I beg of you."""
29,"""Papa, take the water--do pray,"" replied William; ""I cannot leave Ready."""
30,"""I will, my boy,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""but first drink yourself."""
31,"William, who was very faint, drank off the pannikin of water, which immediately revived him, and then, while Mr Seagrave hastened with some water to the children and women, occupied himself with old Ready, who breathed heavily, but did not speak."
