1,"CHAPTER XXIII. CISSY CARTER, BOYS' GIRL."
2," Now Prissy Smith was a girls' girl, while Cissy Carter was a boys' girl. That was mainly the difference between them. Not that Prissy did not love boys' play upon occasion, for which indeed her fleetness of foot particularly fitted her. Also if Hugh John teased her she never cried nor told on him, but waited till he was looking the other way and then gave him something for himself on the ear. But on the whole she was a girls' girl, and her idea of the way to fight was slapping her dolls when they were naughty."
3,"Now, Mr. Picton Smith said that most religion was summed up in two maxims, ""Don't tell lies,"" and ""Don't tell tales."" To these Hugh John added a third, at least equal in canonicity, ""Don't be dasht-mean."" In these you have briefly comprehended all the Law and the Prophets of the house of Windy Standard."
4,"Cissy Carter, however, was a tom-boy: you could not get over that. There was no other word for her. She never played with girls if she could better herself. She despised dolls; she hated botany and the piano. Her governess had a hard but lively time of it, and had it not been for her brother Sammy coaching her in short cuts to knowledge, she would have been left far behind in the exact sciences of spelling and the multiplication-table. As it was, between a tendency to scramble for scraps of information and the run of a pretty wide library, Cissy knew more than any one gave her credit for."
5,"On one memorable occasion it was Cissy's duty to take her grandmother for a walk. Now the Dowager Mrs. Davenant Carter was the dearest and most fairy-like old lady in the world, and Cissy was very proud to walk into Edam with her. For her grandmother had not forgotten how good confections tasted to girls of thirteen, and there was quite a nice shop in the High Street. Their rose-drops especially were almost as good as doing-what-you-were-told-not-to, and their peppermints for use in church had quite the force of a religious observance."
6,"But Mrs. Davenant Carter had a weak eye, and whenever she went out, she put a large green shade over it. So one day it happened that Cissy was walking abroad with her grandmother, with a vision of rose-drop-shop in the offing. As they were passing one of the villas nearest to their house, a certain rude boy, Wedgwood Baker the name of him, seeing the lame old lady tripping by on her stick like a fairy godmother, called out loudly ""Go it, old blind patch!"""
7,"He was sorry the minute after, for in one moment Cissy Carter had pulled off her white thread gloves, climbed the fence, and had landed what Hugh John would have called ""One, two, three--and a tiger"" upon the person of Master Wedgwood Baker."
8,"I do not say that all Cissy Carter's blows were strictly according to Queensberry rules. But at any rate the ungallant youth was promptly doubled up, and retreated yelling into the house, as it were falling back upon his reserves."
9,"That same evening the card of Mrs. Baker, Laurel Villa, Edam, was brought to the diningtable of Mrs. Davenant Carter."
10,"""The lady declines to come in, m'am. She says she must see you immediately at the door,"" said the scandalised housemaid."
11,"Cissy's mother went into the hall with the card in her hand, and a look of gentle surprised inquiry on her face. There, on the doorstep was Mrs. Baker, with a young and hopeful but sadly damaged Wedgwood tagging behind her, like a weak-minded punt in tow of an ancient threedecker."
12,"[""'LOOK AT HIM, MADAM,' SAID MRS. BAKER.""]"
13,The injured lady began at once a voluble complaint.
14,"""Look at him, madam. That is the handiwork of your daughter. The poor boy was quietly digging in the garden, cultivating a few unpretending flowers, when your daughter, madam, suddenly flew at him over the railings and struck him on the face so furiously that, if I had not come to the rescue, the dear boy might have lost the use of both his eyes. But most happily I heard the disturbance and went out and stopped her."""
15,"""Dear me, this is _very_ sad,"" faltered little Mrs. Carter; ""I'm sure I don't know what can have come over Cissy. Are you sure there is no mistake?"""
16,"""Mistake! No, indeed, madam, there is no mistake, I saw her with my own eyes--a great girl twice Wedgwood's size."""
17,At this point Mr. Davenant Carter came to the door with his table-napkin in his hand.
18,"""What's this--what's this?"" he demanded in his quick way--""Cissy and your son been fighting?"""
19,"""No indeed, sir,"" said the complainant indignantly; ""this dear boy never so much as lifted a hand to her. Ah, here she comes--the very--ahem, young lady herself."""
20,"All ignorant of the trouble in store for her, Cissy came whistling through the laurels with half-a-dozen dogs at her heels. At sight of her Mrs. Baker bridled and perked her chin with indignation till all her black bugles clashed and twinkled."
21,"""Come here, Cissy,"" said her father sternly. ""Did you strike this boy to-day in front of his mother's gate?"""
22,"""Yes, I did,"" quoth the undaunted Cissy, ""and what's more, I'll do it again, and give him twice as much, if he ever dares to call _my_ grandmother 'Old Blind Patch' again--I don't care if he is two years and three months older than me!"""
23,"""Did you call names at my mother?"" demanded Cissy's father, towering up very big, and looking remarkably stern."
24,Master Wedgwood had no denial ready; but he had his best boots on and he looked very hard at them.
25,"""Come, Wedgwood dear, tell them that you did not call names. You know you could not!"""
26,"""I never called nobody names. It was her that hit me!"" snivelled Wedgwood."
27,"""Now, you hear,"" said his mother, as if that settled the question."
28,"""Oh, you little liar! Wait till I catch you out!"" said Cissy, going a step nearer as if she would like to begin again. ""I'll teach you to tell lies on me."""
29,"Mrs. Baker of Laurel Villa held up her hands so that the lace mitts came together like the fingers of a figure of grief upon a tomb. ""What a dreadful girl!"" she said, looking up as if to ask Heaven to support her."
30,Mr. Davenant Carter remembered his position as a county magistrate. Also he desired to stand well with all his neighbours.
31,"""Madam,"" he said to Mrs. Baker, in the impressive tone in which he addressed public meetings, ""I regret exceedingly that you should have been put to this trouble. I think that for the future you will have no reason to complain of my daughter. Will you allow me to conduct you across the policies by the shorter way? Cissy, go to bed _at once_, and stop there till I bid you get up! That will teach you to take the law into you own hands when your father is a Justice of the Peace!"""
32,"This he said in such a stern voice that Mrs. Baker was much flattered and quite appeased. He walked with the lady to the small gate in the boundary wall, opened it with his private key, and last of all shook hands with his visitor with the most distinguished courtesy. Some day he meant to stand for the burgh and her brothers were well-to-do grocers in the town."
33,"""Sir,"" she said in parting, ""I hope you will not be too severe with the young lady. Perhaps after all she was only a trifle impulsive!"""
34,"""Discipline must be maintained,"" said Mr. Davenant Carter sternly, closing, however, at the same time the eyelid most remote from Mrs. Baker of Laurel Villa."
35,"""It shows what a humbug pa is,"" muttered Cissy, as she went upstairs; ""he knows very well it is bed-time anyway. I don't believe he is angry one bit!"""
36,"When her father came in, he looked over at his wife. I am afraid he deliberately winked, though in the interests of morality I trust I may be mistaken. For how could a Justice of the Peace and a future Member of Parliament demean himself to wink?"
37,"""Jane,"" he said to Mrs. Carter, ""what does Cissy like most of all for supper?"""
38,"""A little bit of chicken and bread-sauce done with broiled bacon--at least I think so, dear--why do you ask?"""
39,He called the tablemaid.
40,"""Walbridge,"" he said sternly, ""take that disgraceful girl up the breast and both wings of a chicken, also three nice pieces of crisp bacon, four new potatoes with butter-sauce, some raspberrytart with thick cream and plenty of sugar--and a whole bottle of zoedone. But mind you, _nothing else_, as you value your place--not another bite for such a bold bad girl. This will teach her to go about the country thrashing boys two years older than herself!"""
41,He looked over across the table at his son.
42,"""Let this be a lesson to you, sir,"" he said, frowning sternly at him."
43,"""Yes, sir,"" said Sammy meekly, winking in his turn very confidentially at a fly which was having a free wash and brush-up on the edge of the fingerbowl, after completing the round of the dishes on the dinner table."
