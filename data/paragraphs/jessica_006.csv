1,CHAPTER VI. THE FIRST PRAYER.
2," When the service was ended the minister descended the pulpit steps just as Daniel was about to hurry Jessica away, and taking her by the hand in the face of all the congregation he led her into the vestry, whither Jane and Winny quickly followed them. He was fatigued with the services of the day, and his pale face was paler than ever, as he placed Jessica before his chair, into which he threw himself with an air of exhaustion; but bowing his head upon his hands he said, in a low but clear tone, “Lord, these are the lambs of thy flock. Help me to feed thy lambs!”"
3,"“Children,” he said, with a smile upon his weary face, “it is no easy thing to know God. But this one thing we know, that he is our Father--my Father and your Father, Jessica. He loves you, and cares for you more than I do for my little girls here.”"
4,"He smiled at them, and they at him, with an expression which Jessica felt and understood, though it made her sad. She trembled a little, and the minister’s ear caught the sound of a faint though bitter sob."
5,"“I never had any father,” she said sorrowfully."
6,"“God is your Father,” he answered very gently: “he knows all about you, because he is present everywhere. We cannot see him, but we have only to speak and he hears us, and we may ask him for whatever we want.”"
7,"“Will he let me speak to him, as well as these fine children, that are clean and have got nice clothes?” asked Jessica, glancing anxiously at her muddy feet, and her soiled and tattered frock."
8,"“Yes,” said the minister, smiling, yet sighing at the same time; “you may ask him this moment for what you want.”"
9,"Jessica gazed round the room with large wide-open eyes, as if she were seeking to see God; but then she shut her eyelids tightly, and bending her head upon her hands, as she had seen the minister do, she said, “O God! I want to know about you. And please pay Mr. Daniel for all the warm coffee he’s give me.”"
10,"Jane and Winny listened with faces of unutterable amazement; but the tears stood in the minister’s eyes, and he added “Amen” to Jessica’s first prayer."
