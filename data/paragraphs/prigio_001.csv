1,PREFACE.
2,"In compiling the following History from the Archives of Pantouflia, the Editor has incurred several obligations to the Learned. The Return of Benson (chapter xii.) is the fruit of the research of the late Mr. Allen Quatermain, while the final _wish_ of Prince Prigio was suggested by the invention or erudition of a Lady."
3,"A study of the _Firedrake_ in South Africa, where he is called the _Nanaboulélé_, a difficult word-has been published in French (translated from the Basuto language) by M. Paul Sébillot, in the _Revue des Traditione Populaires_. For the _Rémora_, the Editor is indebted to the _Voyage à la Lune_ of M. Cyrano de Bergérac."
