1,CHAPTER 11. WHAT BEFELL WHILE THE QUEEN WAS HOPING.
2,"The secret cipher letters went now faster than ever, and seem to have been so urgent about speedy help and rescue as to have appeared somewhat peevish to friends at a distance.  The queen's sister wrote from Brussels that she hoped the royal family did not doubt the anxiety of their friends: that the danger appeared indeed as pressing as it could be represented; but that some prudence was necessary on the part of those who were preparing help, and some patience on the part of those who were awaiting it.--Alas!  It was difficult for the poor queen to be patient, expecting, as she did daily, the murder of the king.  Though this fear seems to have been unfounded, it caused her as much suffering as if it had been just.--She had a breastplate made for the king, of silk many times folded, and well wadded, so that it would resist the blow of a dagger, and even a pistol-ball.  This under-dress was made at Madame Campan's house; and she brought it into the palace, wearing it as an under-petticoat, that no one might see it.  For three days, in the beginning of July, did Madame Campan wear this heavy warm petticoat before an opportunity could be found for the king to try it on.  The occasion for which it was wanted was the 14th of July, the anniversary of the destruction of the Bastille, and the date of the Independence of the Nation, as the nation chose to say: on which day the king was to appear in public."
3,"When he tried on the breastplate, he said in a low voice to Madame Campan that he wore this to satisfy the queen, but that he was persuaded he should not be assassinated, but left to be disposed of in another way.  The queen afterwards made Madame Campan repeat to her what the king had said, and then observed that this was not new to her: she had seen the king much occupied of late in studying the history of Charles the First of England.  The king declared that he studied this history in order to learn how to avoid the errors of Charles in dealing with his people.  Alas!  If he had done so twenty years before, it is doubtful whether such study could have been of any use to a ruler who had neither the knowledge nor the spirit necessary for the times.  Now it was by many years too late.  No one believed in his sincerity: every one despised his weakness; and he was so humbled that no act of his could have the force or the grace of freedom.  The history of Charles the First is indeed a most instructive lesson to kings: but it is a lesson which must be learned and used while kings are still sitting on an honoured and unshaken throne."
4,"There were people enough in Paris grieved and shocked at the proceedings of the 20th of June to have made some stand in defence of the king,-- some delay in the dissolution of society; and these people declared themselves by public acts, particularly by petitions to the Assembly.  A man of spirit would have seized the occasion: and if the king had been such a man, he might possibly have risen from this point out of his misfortunes, and so have made a favourable day out of that most miserable one.  But, as usual, the royal family overlooked the opportunity.  They were so occupied in looking for help from Germany, that they had no attention, no trust, for friends nearer home.  The Duke of Brunswick was coming with an army to rescue them.  The people knew this well enough; and their panic about an invasion did not make them love the more the family at whose call the invaders were coming.  On the 25th of July, the Duke of Brunswick began his march into France, and issued a proclamation which said that the whole French nation should be protected by him in rallying round their king; but that, if any parties should insult the king, or carry him away from Paris, such persons should be destroyed, and Paris blown to pieces with his cannon.  As the French nation did not wish or intend to rally round their king, this proclamation made them furious, and caused the destruction of the royal family in a shorter time than it would otherwise have happened; if it had otherwise happened at all.  Was ever such mournful folly heard of as marks the whole history of this unhappy king?  One's compassion, however, is chiefly for the three who were victims of this folly without sharing it.  The king and queen brought much of their misery upon themselves; but the sweet Princess Elizabeth and the two children suffered without having sinned.  The darkness of their lot was now gathering fast about them."
5,"It was impossible, after the late proceedings, to consider the palace safe at any hour.  The queen feared assassination for herself as a foreigner, and a trial for the king, preparatory to his death upon the scaffold; and she desired to guard against any seizure of papers, which might now take place at any time.  She deposited her ready money in the hands of a faithful person; and the king employed his old companion, Gamin, the locksmith, to make, in great secrecy, a safe for papers in a place where no one would suspect its existence.  This fellow betrayed the secret; first, luckily, to some friends; and the queen, hearing of this, persuaded the king to empty out the safe.  Gamin afterwards publicly informed the enemies of the king of this cupboard, and moreover swore that the king attempted to poison him when it was done, that the secret might be safe.  This absurd calumny was believed, like everything else that was said against the royal family; and the wretch had a pension given him.  Such was the king's reward for submitting, like a timid apprentice, to this man's insolence, while learning lock-making from him, for ten years past."
6,"General Lafayette came to Paris, to remonstrate, at the head of twenty-thousand petitioners, against the late treatment of the king.  Of course, those who had done it looked coldly upon him; and so did the king.  The king forbade his officers to support anything proposed by General Lafayette; and the queen refused to allow him to remove her and her family to the loyal city of Rouen.  Lafayette, thus unsupported, had to hasten back to the army; and in this way the royal family insulted and dismissed the last person who could have rescued them from their impending fate."
7,"Whenever even the children appeared out of doors, they experienced such insults that they left off going anywhere beyond the palace gardens, from which the public were excluded, in order to allow the family to take the air unmolested.  Such cries, however, were heard from the terrace outside, that, after being twice driven in by them, the family gave up going out at all Louis had to give up his gardening, and the sight of the flowers he had sown, and to keep within doors all these long bright summer days."
8,"The queen could not sleep much; and she ordered that neither the shutters nor blinds of her chamber should be closed, that the nights might appear less long.  One night, as Madame Campan watched beside her, she fixed her eyes on the moon, and said softly, that before she saw the same moon next month, she and the king should be free.  She declared that their affairs were now proceeding fast and well, and told how the army from Germany was to march, and how soon it might arrive.  She admitted that there were alarming differences of advice and opinion among their followers, and spoke of the fatal consequences of the king's irresolution; but still she hoped that another month would set them free.  She was, as usual, completely mistaken.  She found it so hard to bear the insults daily offered, even while expecting so speedy an end to them, that she declared she should have preferred imprisonment in a tower, on a lonely sea-shore, to her present condition.  On their way through the corridor to the chapel, one Sunday, the king and she were greeted by the cry from some of the guards of ""Long live the king!"" but others broke in with ""No, no; no king!  Down with the veto!""  This struck upon the queen's heart; for it was she who had persuaded the king to put his veto, or prohibition, upon the banishment of the priests. When they were in the chapel, something worse happened.  The passage ""He bringeth down the mighty from their seat,"" had to be sung; and when the choir came to it, they sang, or shouted it, three times as loud as any other part of the service.  The king's adherents were so angry at this that when the words came ""And may the Lord keep the king in safety,"" the royalists shouted out three times ""And the Queen.""  This indecent contention went on during the whole time of service; and the royal family found that they were no longer permitted even to worship in peace."
9,"On the 9th of August, there was much noise and confusion throughout Paris; and it became known that an insurrection was to take place the next morning.  Louis knew that something was dreaded, but he slept as usual.  His servant, Clery, put him to bed at half-past eight, while it was still daylight, and then went out, to try what he could learn of the proceedings of the people.  The king and queen supped at nine o'clock. While Madame Campan waited on them at table, a noise was heard outside the door.  Madame Campan went to see what it was.  Two of the guards were fighting,--one abusing the king, and the other insisting that he was sincere in professing to stand by the Constitution.  If the queen had not before given over all idea of safety, she would now have done so.  She said she knew that some of their fiercest enemies were among their guards;--not their Swiss guards, but those who wore the national uniform."
10,"This was a terrible night.  It was oppressively hot; and the rooms of the palace were crowded with gentlemen, adherents of the court, who had come to devote themselves finally for their king and his family.  The Swiss guards,--picked Swiss soldiers, strong and brave, hired to guard the person and palace of the sovereign,--stood silently at their posts, their red uniforms contrasting with the black clothes of the seven hundred gentlemen who waited to see what they were to do.  Though these seemed a large number when collected under a roof,--though the rooms were so full that the windows had to be thrown open, and the mayor Petion went down to walk in the gardens because the heat was so oppressive within, this was no force to oppose to a siege from the population of Paris.  The king caused the plan of defence, prepared by General Viomenil, to be communicated to an officer, who said to Madame Campan, ""Put your jewels and money into your pockets.  There is no chance for us.  The measures of defence are good for nothing.  Our only chance is in the resolution of the king; and with all his virtues, he has not that."""
11,"Never yet had the king cut such a wretched figure as on this occasion. He often congratulated himself on no blood having been shed by his order: and this was one of his dying consolations.  It seems never to have occurred to him that his weakness caused more destruction than even cruelty would have done.  It caused not only the loss of many lives; it encouraged the breaking up of society from its very foundations; it spared the wicked, while it betrayed the faithful.  It did moral injury, which it may be worse to have to answer for in the end than some acts of bloodshed.  He would not have half a dozen shots fired to make a way for his coach over the bridge of Varennes; but he deserted, without a moment's scruple, his devoted Swiss guards, as we shall see; and as he refused to suffer with them, he may be considered answerable for their lives."
12,"The clang of bells was heard by the inmates of the palace, as they stood, this summer night, by the open windows.  Steeple after steeple rang out; and every one knew that this was the token of insurrection in the respective parishes.  Petion had been sent for, to answer for what was doing; he had not been civilly treated within doors, as might be supposed,--the king speaking very roughly to him.  He could not get away again, as the gates were all guarded, and no one allowed to pass; so that the only thing he could well do was to walk in the gardens."
13,"At four in the morning, the National Assembly sent for him, to appear and give an account of Paris.  Considering that he had been pacing the garden walks all night, the Mayor of Paris was as little able as anybody to give an account of the city; but he was glad to get away, considering his situation one of great danger."
14,"The number of the Swiss guards was a thousand.  Their post was within the Tuileries.  Outside were squadrons under the command of Mandat, a loyal officer, who kept them ranged with their cannon round the outer enclosures of the palace.  Just at dawn, Mandat was sent for by the magistrates of the city, and went alone, suspecting no danger.  To his amazement, he found that, with the exception of the mayor and one or two more, the entire magistracy was changed, and now composed of furious revolutionary men.  They arrested him, and ordered him to prison; but the mob seized him on the steps, and murdered him.  The question next was, what his soldiers would do now they had lost their commander.  They were hungry and weary; and were heard to say how sad it would be to fire upon their own countrymen--how much easier to side with them.  Now was the moment for the king to speak and act.  Now he was told what a gloomy and uncertain temper these squadrons were in.  He owed it to his office, to his family, to his adherents, to his Swiss guards, to endeavour to confirm these soldiers in their duty to him.  A word, a look, a gesture might, in the right moment, have done it.  What did he do?"
15,"In the middle of the night, while all was supposed to be well among the soldiers outside, the king had retired for a while.  When he appeared again, on the arrival of fresh tidings, it was seen, by the powder being rubbed off from one side of his head, that he had been lying down to get a little sleep.  The queen and Princess Elizabeth also withdrew; but not to sleep.  They went, with Madame Campan to attend upon them, to a small room on the ground-floor, where they lay down on couches.  In preparing to lie down, the princess took out the cornelian pin which fastened her dress, and showed Madame Campan what was engraved upon it.  It was the stem of a lily, with the inscription, ""Oblivion of wrongs: forgiveness of injuries."""
16,"""I fear,"" said the princess, ""our enemies do not regard that maxim: but we must, nevertheless.""  The ladies conversed sadly enough, but little imagining what was happening to Mandat.  At last they heard a shot. They sprang from their couches, observing that this was the first shot, but would not be the last.  They must go to the king.  They did so, desiring Madame Campan to follow, and to be in waiting with the other ladies.--At four o'clock, the queen came out of the king's apartment, saying that she had no longer any hope whatever, as Mandat was killed. Yet the king was going out to review the squadrons who had lost their commander; and the wife of a resolute and spirited king would not have been without hope.  She would have hoped much from the king's presence and appeal.  It was because she knew the king so well that she had no hope."
17,"Orders were given for Louis to be taken up and brought immediately: and he was presently ready,--at a little before five, when (it being the 10th of August) it was quite light.  His sister appeared too, and the whole family went out to review the soldiers, as it was said, and to see the preparations for defence.  Louis had hold of his father's hand.  At first, a few voices cried ""Long live the king!"" but the king, pale and silent, walked on without taking any notice; and in a few moments there was a long growl, which burst into a clamour of ""Long live the nation!"" Some of the gunners thrust themselves forward, and shook their fists in the king's face, uttering the grossest insults.  Some of the attendants pushed them back; but the king, now white as the wall, said not a word. Followed by the ladies of his family, he walked along the line, and back again, leaving nothing but contempt behind.  ""All is lost,"" said the queen to Madame Campan, as she entered her apartments: ""the king showed no energy; and this review has done nothing but harm.""  What a lot was hers!  To be dragged down, with her children, to destruction, by the apathy of a husband, while she herself had spirit enough to have ruled an empire, but must not now exert it, because it would exasperate the people to have the foreigner, the Austrian, meddle with the affairs of France!"
18,"What was to be done next?  The Swiss, and the gentlemen and servants of the court, were all that now remained to be depended upon.  The Swiss stood firm as their own Alps.  The household arranged themselves in the apartments, armed, and ready for the assault from without: though no one of them could have hope of victory, or any expectation but of destruction.  In this terrible hour, however, they jested; and upon a melancholy subject.  They were miserably armed; and they quizzed one another and themselves for the appearance they made.  None had more than a sword and a pair of pistols: one page had only a single pocket-pistol; and another page and equerry had broken a pair of tongs, and taken each a half."
19,"The insurgents were now surrounding the Tuileries, and filling the neighbourhood: and it seemed probable that the gunners, placed outside for the defence of the palace, would turn their cannon against it.  The king sent a messenger to the Assembly, to request them to depute some of their body to be a safeguard to the throne in this extremity.  The Assembly took no notice of the message; but went on with their regular business."
20,"The magistrate of the district saw now, from the temper of the people outside, no chance but of destruction to every individual within the palace, if once the siege began.  The error was in ever pretending to make a defence, while such a helpless being as the king must be the one to give orders.  It was too late to help that now.  There were the cannon, with the gunners surlily asking whether it was expected of them to fire upon the people: and there were the people, too many and too angry to be got rid of.  The magistrate of the district, Roederer, visited the palace, and begged a private interview with the king.  He was shown into a small apartment, which the king and queen entered. Roederer proposed their going over to the Assembly without a moment's delay, to commit themselves and their children to the protection of the representatives of the people.  ""No, no!"" exclaimed the queen, blushing, no doubt, at the thought of the infamy of deserting, at the fatal moment, their adherents, their steady Swiss, and the servants of the household.  Roederer told her that by remaining she would render herself responsible for the lives of the whole family; for that no power could save them within the walls of the palace.  She said no more.  The king sat, the picture of indifference, with his hands upon his knees, listening.  When there was a pause, and he must say something, he looked over his shoulder to the queen, and said, ""Let us go."""
21,"As they left the apartment the queen told Madame Campan to remain till either the family should return, or she should be sent for to join her mistress,--no one knew where.  The family never returned."
22,"Only two ladies were permitted to accompany them,--the Princess de Lamballe and Madame de Tourzel.  In order to fulfil her duty,--in order not to desert Louis,--his governess was compelled to leave her daughter Pauline, only seventeen years old, in this besieged palace, among the soldiers.  Pauline escaped with life and safety, and joined her mother soon after."
23,"As the king walked through the apartments of the palace, followed by his family, Roederer went before him, saying, ""Make way!  The king is going to the Assembly.""  How these words must have pierced the hearts of his devoted servants, of his faithful Swiss!  This was the reward of their brave fidelity!  The king was leaving those who were ready to die rather than desert him.  He was going to walk out at an open door, while they were shut in, to be shot down like game in an enclosure."
24,"The family had but a short way to go; and their passage to the Assembly was watched from the windows by some of the doomed friends whom they left behind.  They walked between two rows of guards; but were yet so pressed upon that the queen was robbed of her watch and purse.  Louis held his mother's hand, and amused himself with kicking the dead leaves as he walked.  A gigantic man, a ringleader of the mob, snatched up the boy, and carried him.  The queen screamed with terror, and was near fainting: but the man said, ""Do not be frightened: I will do him no harm.""  He merely carried him, and then set him down at the gate, where a deputation from the Assembly came out, to meet the royal family.  From the palace windows the royal family were seen to enter that gate; and those who saw it well knew that all hope for the royal cause was now over."
25,"The assailants without and the defenders in the outer court of the Tuileries did not know of the departure of the royal family; and the battle therefore began with fury.  The gentlemen and servants had now only to think of saving themselves as they could.  Some escaped from windows, and others under disguises: but many were murdered.  The fate of the Swiss was dreadful.  They fought bravely, and kept their ranks. At last, a messenger arrived with a written order from the king that they should cease firing.  But they were still fired upon from without. They knew not what to do, and dispersed.  Some few reached the Assembly, and were sheltered there.  Some few more fled into private houses; but, as for the rest, their blood streamed on the floor of the palace, and their bodies blocked up the doorways.  Some lay dead on the terraces, and others were shot down from street to street as they fled, fighting their way.  From fifty to eighty were marched as prisoners to the Hall where the magistrates were sitting: but the crowd broke in upon them on the way, and slaughtered them every one.  Their last thought might well have been, ""Put not your trust in princes.""  But perhaps more painful thoughts still were in their fainting hearts; and before their swimming eyes might be visions of their homes in the Swiss valleys, and their wives and children singing of them, while tending the cows on the mountain side.  Yet the king who, by his orders and arrangements, gave them over to such a death as this, and deserted them at the crisis, was for ever consoling himself with the thought that not a drop of blood had ever been shed by his command."
26,"In the neighbourhood of Lucerne, in Switzerland, there is a monument to the memory of these men.  Above a little lake rises a precipitous face of rock.  In the midst of this the monument is hollowed out.  The Swiss lion, wounded and dying, grasps with its failing claws the French shield, with the royal lilies upon it.--If the king had sent his family to the Assembly for safety, and himself remained to fall with his adherents, this monument would not have been, as it is now, a reproach upon his memory, durable as Swiss honour and as the everlasting rock."
