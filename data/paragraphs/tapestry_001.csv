1,CHAPTER I. MADEMOISELLE JEANNE.
2,"          ""Maitre Corbeau, sur un arbre perch√©.""                                LA FONTAINE."
3," It was so cold. Ah, so very cold! So thought the old raven as he hobbled up and down the terrace walk at the back of the house--the walk that was so pleasant in summer, with its pretty view of the lower garden, gay with the bright, stiffly-arranged flowerbeds, so pleasantly warm and yet shady with the old trees overhead, where the raven's second cousins, the rooks, managed their affairs, not without a good deal of chatter about it, it must be confessed. ""Silly creatures,"" the raven was in the habit of calling them with contempt--all to himself, of course, for no one understood the different tones of his croaking, even though he was a French raven and had received the best of educations. But to-day he was too depressed in spirit by the cold to think of his relations or their behaviour at all. He just hopped or hobbled--I hardly know which you would call it--slowly and solemnly up and down the long walk, where the snow lay so thick that at each hop it came ever so far up his black claws, which annoyed him very much, I assure you, and made him wish more than ever that summer was back again."
4,"Poor old fellow! he was not usually of a discontented disposition; but to-day, it must be allowed, he was in the right about the cold. It was _very_ cold."
5,"Several others beside the raven were thinking so--the three chickens who lived in a queer little house in one corner of the yard thought so, and huddled the closer together, as they settled themselves for the night. For though it was only half-past three in the afternoon, they thought it was no use sitting up any longer on such a make-believe of a day, when not the least little ray of sunshine had succeeded in creeping through the leaden-grey sky. And the tortoise _would_ have thought so too if he could, but he was too sleepy to think at all, as he ""cruddled"" himself into his shell in the corner of the laurel hedge, and dreamt of the nice hot days that were past."
6,"And upstairs, inside the old house, somebody else was thinking so too--a little somebody who seemed to be doing her best to make herself, particularly her nose, colder still, for she was pressing it hard on to the icy window-pane and staring out on to the deserted, snow-covered garden, and thinking how cold it was, and wishing it was summer time again, and fancying how it would feel to be a raven like old ""Dudu,"" all at once, in the mixed-up, dancing-about way that ""thinking"" was generally done in the funny little brain of Mademoiselle Jeanne."
7,"Inside the room it was getting dark, and the white snow outside seemed to make it darker."
8,"""Mademoiselle Jeanne,"" said a voice belonging to a servant who just then opened the door; ""Mademoiselle Jeanne, what are you doing at the window? You will catch cold."""
9,"Jeanne gave a little start when she heard herself spoken to. She had been all alone in the room for some time, with not a sound about her. She turned slowly from the window and came near the fire."
10,"""If I did catch cold, it would not be bad,"" she said. ""I would stay in bed, and you, Marcelline, would make me nice things to eat, and nobody would say, 'Don't do that, Mademoiselle.' It would be charming."""
11,"Marcelline was Jeanne's old nurse, and she had been her mother's nurse too. She was really rather old, how old nobody seemed exactly to know, but Jeanne thought her _very_ old, and asked her once if she had not been her grandmother's nurse too. Any one else but Marcelline would have been offended at such a question; but Marcelline was not like any one else, and she never was offended at anything. She was so old that for many years no one had seen much difference in her--she had reached a sort of settled oldness, like an arm-chair which may once have been covered with bright-coloured silk, but which, with time and wear, has got to have an all-over-old look which never seems to get any worse. Not that Marcelline was dull or grey to look at--she was bright and cheery, and when she had a new clean cap on, all beautifully frilled and crimped round her face, Jeanne used to tell her that she was beautiful, quite beautiful, and that if she was _very_ good and always did exactly what Jeanne asked her, she--Jeanne--would have her to be nurse to her children when she had grown up to be a lady, married to some very nice gentleman."
12,"And when Jeanne chattered like that, Marcelline used to smile; she never said anything, she just smiled. Sometimes Jeanne liked to see her smile; sometimes it would make her impatient, and she would say, ""Why do you smile like that, Marcelline? _Speak!_ When I speak I like you to speak too."""
13,"But all she could get Marcelline to answer would be, ""Well, Mademoiselle, it is very well what you say."""
14,"This evening--or perhaps I should say afternoon, for whatever hour the chickens' timepiece made it, it was only half-past three by the great big clock that stood at the end of the long passage by Jeanne's room door;--this afternoon Jeanne was not quite as lively as she sometimes was. She sat down on the floor in front of the fire and stared into it. It was pretty to look at just then, for the wood was burning redly, and at the tiniest touch a whole bevy of lovely sparks would fly out like bees from a hive, or a covey of birds, or better still, like a thousand imprisoned fairies escaping at some magic touch. Of all things, Jeanne loved to give this magic touch. There was no poker, but she managed just as well with a stick of unburnt wood, or sometimes, when she was _quite_ sure Marcelline was not looking, with the toe of her little shoe. Just now it was Marcelline who set the fairy sparks free by moving the logs a little and putting on a fresh one behind."
15,"""How pretty they are, are they not, Marcelline?"" said Jeanne."
16,"Marcelline did not speak, and when Jeanne looked up at her, she saw by the light of the fire that she was smiling. Jeanne held up her forefinger."
17,"""Naughty Marcelline,"" she said; ""you are not to smile. You are to _speak_. I want you to speak very much, for it is so dull, and I have nothing to do. I want you to tell me stories, Marcelline. Do you hear, you naughty little thing?"""
18,"""And what am I to tell you stories about then, Mademoiselle? You have got all out of my old head long ago; and when the grain is all ground what can the miller do?"""
19,"""Get some more, of course,"" said Jeanne. ""Why, _I_ could make stories if I tried, I daresay, and I am only seven, and you who are a hundred--are you _quite_ a hundred, Marcelline?"""
20,Marcelline shook her head.
21,"""Not _quite_, Mademoiselle,"" she said."
22,"""Well, never mind, you are old enough to make stories, any way. Tell me more about the country where you lived when you were little as I; the country you will never tell me the name of. Oh, I do like that one about the Golden Princess shut up in the castle by the sea! I like stories about princesses best of all. I do wish I were a princess; next to my best wish of all, I wish to be a princess. Marcelline, do you hear? I want you to tell me a story."""
23,Still Marcelline did not reply. She in her turn was looking into the fire. Suddenly she spoke.
24,"""One, two, three,"" she said. ""Quick, now, Mademoiselle, quick, quick. Wish a wish before that last spark is gone. Quick, Mademoiselle."""
25,"""Oh dear, what shall I wish?"" exclaimed Jeanne. ""When you tell me to be quick it all goes out of my head; but I know now. I wish----"""
26,"""Hush, Mademoiselle,"" said Marcelline, quickly again. ""You must not say it aloud. Never mind, it is all right. You have wished it before the spark is gone. It will come true, Mademoiselle."""
27,Jeanne's bright dark eyes glanced up at Marcelline with an expression of mingled curiosity and respect.
28,"""How do you know it will come true?"" she said."
29,"Marcelline's old eyes, nearly as bright and dark still as Jeanne's own, had a half-mischievous look in them as she replied, solemnly shaking her head,"
30,"""I know, Mademoiselle, and that is all I can say. And when the time comes for your wish to be granted, you will see if I am not right."""
31,"""Shall I?"" said Jeanne, half impressed, half rebellious. ""Do the fairies tell you things, Marcelline? Not that I believe there are any fairies--not now, any way."""
32,"""Don't say that, Mademoiselle,"" said Marcelline. ""In that country I have told you of no one ever said such a thing as that."""
33,"""Why didn't they? Did they really _see_ fairies there?"" asked Jeanne, lowering her voice a little."
34,"""Perhaps,"" said Marcelline; but that was all she _would_ say, and Jeanne couldn't get her to tell her any fairy stories, and had to content herself with making them for herself instead out of the queer shapes of the burning wood of the fire."
35,"She was so busy with these fancies that she did not hear the stopping of the click-click of Marcelline's knitting needles, nor did she hear the old nurse get up from her chair and go out of the room. A few minutes before, the _facteur_ had rung at the great wooden gates of the courtyard--a rather rare event, for in those days letters came only twice a week--but this, too, little Jeanne had not heard. She must have grown drowsy with the quiet and the heat of the fire, for she quite started when the door again opened, and Marcelline's voice told her that her mother wanted her to go down to the salon, she had something to say to her."
36,"""O Marcelline,"" said Jeanne, rubbing her eyes, ""I didn't know you had gone away. What does mamma want? O Marcelline, I am so sleepy, I would like to go to bed."""
37,"""To go to bed, Mademoiselle, and not yet five o'clock! Oh no, you will wake up nicely by the time you get down to the salon."""
38,"""I am so tired, Marcelline,"" persisted Jeanne. ""These winter days it is so dull. I don't mind in summer, for then I can play in the garden with Dudu and the tortoise, and all the creatures. But in winter it is so dull. I would not be tired if I had a little friend to play with me."""
39,"""Keep up your heart, Mademoiselle. Stranger things have happened than that you should have some one to play with."""
40,"""What do you mean, Marcelline?"" said Jeanne, curiously. ""Do you know something, Marcelline? Tell me, do. Did you know what my wish was?"" she added, eagerly."
41,"""I know, Mademoiselle, that Madame will be waiting for you in the salon. We can talk about your wish later; when I am putting you to bed."""
42,"She would say no more, but smoothed Jeanne's soft dark hair, never very untidy it must be owned, for it was always neatly plaited in two tails that hung down her back, as was then the fashion for little girls of Jeanne's age and country, and bade her again not to delay going downstairs."
43,"Jeanne set off. In that great rambling old house it was really quite a journey from her room to her mother's salon. There was the long corridor to pass, at one end of which were Jeanne's quarters, at the other a room which had had for her since her babyhood a mingled fascination and awe. It was hung with tapestry, very old, and in some parts faded, but still distinct. As Jeanne passed by the door of this room, she noticed that it was open, and the gleam of the faint moonlight on the snow-covered garden outside attracted her."
44,"""I can see the terrace ever so much better from the tapestry room window,"" she said to herself. ""I wonder what Dudu is doing, poor old fellow. Oh, how cold he must be! I suppose Grignan is asleep in a hole in the hedge, and the chickens will be all right any way. I have not seen Houpet all day."""
45,"""Houpet"" was Jeanne's favourite of the three chickens. He had come by his name on account of a wonderful tuft of feathers on the top of his head, which stuck straight up and then waved down again, something like a little umbrella. No doubt he was a very rare and wonderful chicken, and if I were clever about chickens I would be able to tell you all his remarkable points. But that I cannot do. I can only say he was the queerest-looking creature that ever pecked about a poultry-yard, and how it came to pass that Jeanne admired him so, I cannot tell you either."
46,"""Poor Houpet!"" she repeated, as she ran across the tapestry room to the uncurtained window; ""I am sure he must have been very sad without me all day. He has such a loving heart. The others are nice too, but not half so loving. And Grignan has no heart at all; I suppose tortoises never have; only he is very comical, which is nearly as nice. As for Dudu, I really cannot say, he is so stuck up, as if he knew better than any one else. Ah, there he is, the old fellow! Well, Dudu,"" she called out, as if the raven could have heard her so far off and through the closely shut window; ""well, Dudu, how are you to-day, my dear sir? How do you like the snow and the cold?"""
47,Dudu calmly continued his promenade up and down the terrace. Jeanne could clearly distinguish his black shape against the white ground.
48,"""I am going downstairs to see mamma, Dudu,"" she went on. ""I love mamma very much, but I wish she wasn't my mother at all, but my sister. I wish she was turned into a little girl to play with me, and that papa was turned into a little boy. How funny he would look with his white hair, wouldn't he, Dudu? Oh, you stupid Dudu, why won't you speak to me? I wish you would come up here; there's a beautiful castle and garden in the tapestry, where you would have two peacocks to play with;"" for just at that moment the moon, passing from under a cloud, lighted up one side of the tapestry, which, as Jeanne said, represented a garden with various curious occupants. And as the wavering brightness caught the grotesque figures in turn, it really seemed to the little girl as if they moved. Half pleased, half startled at the fancy, she clapped her hands."
49,"""Dudu, Dudu,"" she cried, ""the peacocks want you to come; they're beginning to jump about;"" and almost as she said the words a loud croak from the raven sounded in her ears, and turning round, there, to her amazement, she saw Dudu standing on the ledge of the window outside, his bright eyes shining, his black wings flapping, just as if he would say,"
50,"""Let me in, Mademoiselle, let me in. Why do you mock me by calling me if you won't let me in?"""
51,"Completely startled by this time, Jeanne turned and fled."
52,"""He must be a fairy,"" she said by herself; ""I'll never make fun of Dudu any more--_never_. He must be a fairy, or how else could he have got up from the terrace on to the window-sill all in a minute? And I don't think a raven fairy would be nice at all; he'd be a sort of an imp, I expect. I wouldn't mind now if Houpet was a fairy, he's so gentle and loving; but Dudu would be a sort of ogre fairy, he's so black and solemn. Oh dear, how he startled me! How did he get up there? I'm very glad _I_ don't sleep in the tapestry room."""
53,"But when she got down to the brightly-lighted salon her cheeks were so pale and her eyes so startled-looking that her mother was quite concerned, and eagerly asked what was the matter."
54,"""Nothing,"" said Jeanne at first, after the manner of little girls, and boys too, when they do not want to be cross-questioned; but after a while she confessed that she had run into the tapestry room on her way down, and that the moonlight made the figures look as if they were moving--and--and--that Dudu came and stood on the window-sill and croaked at her."
55,"""Dudu stood on the window-sill outside the tapestry room!"" repeated her father; ""impossible, my child! Why, Dudu could not by any conceivable means get up there; you might as well say you saw the tortoise there too."""
56,"""If I had called him perhaps he _would_ have come too; I believe Dudu and he are great friends,"" thought Jeanne to herself, for her mind was in a queer state of confusion, and she would not have felt very much astounded at anything. But aloud she only repeated, ""I'm sure he was there, dear papa."""
57,"And to satisfy her, her kind father, though he was not so young as he had been, and the bad weather made him very rheumatic, mounted upstairs to the tapestry room, and carefully examined the window inside and out."
58,"""Nothing of the kind to be seen, my little girl,"" was his report. ""Master Dudu was hobbling about in the snow on his favourite terrace walk as usual. I hope the servants give him a little meat in this cold weather, by the by. I must speak to Eug√®ne about it. What you fancied was Dudu, my little Jeanne,"" he continued, ""must have been a branch of the ivy blown across the window. In the moonlight, and with the reflections of the snow, things take queer shapes."""
59,"""But there is no wind, and the ivy doesn't grow so high up, and the ivy could not have _croaked_,"" thought Jeanne to herself again, though she was far too well brought up a little French girl to contradict her father by saying so."
60,"""Perhaps so, dear papa,"" was all she said."
61,But her parents still looked a little uneasy.
62,"""She cannot be quite well,"" said her mother. ""She must be feverish. I must tell Marcelline to make her a little tisane when she goes to bed."""
63,"""Ah, bah!"" said Jeanne's white-headed papa. ""What we were speaking of will be a much better cure than tisane. She needs companionship of her own age."""
64,"Jeanne pricked up her ears at this, and glanced at her mother inquiringly. Instantly there started into her mind Marcelline's prophecy about her wish."
65,"""The naughty little Marcelline!"" she thought to herself. ""She has been tricking me. I believe she knew something was going to happen. Mamma, my dear mamma!"" she cried, eagerly but respectfully, ""have you something to tell me? Have you had letters, mamma, from the country, where the little cousin lives?"""
66,"Jeanne's mother softly stroked the cheeks, red enough now, of her excited little daughter."
67,"""Yes, my child,"" she replied. ""I have had a letter. It was for that I sent for you--to tell you about it. I have a letter from the grandfather of Hugh, with whom he has lived since his parents died, and he accepts my invitation. Hugh is to come to live with us, as his mother would have wished. His grandfather can spare him, for he has other grandchildren, and we need him, do we not, my Jeanne? My little girl needs a little brother--and I loved his mother so much,"" she added in a lower voice."
68,"Jeanne could not speak. Her face was glowing with excitement, her breath came quick and short, almost, it seemed, as if she were going to cry. ""O, mamma!"" was all she could say--""O mamma!"" but her mother understood her."
69,"""And when will he come?"" asked Jeanne next."
70,"""Soon, I hope. In a few days; but it depends on the weather greatly. The snow has stopped the diligences in several places, they say; but his grandfather writes that he would like Hugh to come soon, as he himself has to leave home."""
71,"""And will he be always with us? Will he do lessons with me, mamma, and go to the ch√¢teau with us in summer, and always be with us?"""
72,"""I hope so. For a long time at least. And he will do lessons with you at first--though when he gets big he will need more teachers, of course."""
73,"""He is a year older than I, mamma."""
74,"""Yes, he is eight."""
75,"""And, mamma,"" added Jeanne, after some consideration, ""what room will he have?"""
76,"""The tapestry room,"" said her mother. ""It is the warmest, and Hugh is rather delicate, and may feel it cold here. And the tapestry room is not far from yours, my little Jeanne, so you can keep your toys and books together. There is only one thing I do not quite understand in the letter,"" went on Jeanne's mother, turning to her husband as she always did in any difficulty--he was so much older and wiser than she, she used to say. ""Hugh's grandfather says Hugh has begged leave to bring a pet with him, and he hopes I will not mind. What can it be? I cannot read the other word."""
77,"""A little dog probably,"" said Jeanne's father, putting on his spectacles as he took the letter from his wife, ""a pet--gu--ga--and then comes another word beginning with 'p.' It almost looks like 'pig,' but it could not be a pet pig. No, I cannot read it either; we must wait to see till he comes."""
78,       *       *       *       *       *
79,"As Marcelline was preparing to put Jeanne to bed that night, the little girl suddenly put her arms round her nurse's neck, and drew down her old face till it was on a level with her own."
80,"""Look in my face, Marcelline,"" she said. ""Now look in my face and confess. Now, didn't you know that mamma had got a letter to-night and what it said, and was not that how you knew my wish would come true?"""
81,Marcelline smiled.
82,"""That was one way I knew, Mademoiselle,"" she said."
83,"""Well, it shows I'm right not to believe in fairies any way. I really did think at first that the fairies had told you something, but----"" suddenly she stopped as the remembrance of her adventure in the tapestry room returned to her mind. ""Dudu may be a fairy, whether Marcelline has anything to do with fairies or not,"" she reflected. It was better certainly to approach such subjects respectfully. ""Marcelline,"" she added, after a little silence, ""there is only one thing I don't like. I wish the little cousin were not going to sleep in the tapestry room."""
84,"""Not in the tapestry room, Mademoiselle?"" exclaimed Marcelline, ""why, it is the best room in the house! You, who are so fond of stories, Mademoiselle--why there are stories without end on the walls of the tapestry room; particularly on a moonlight night."""
85,"""_Are_ there?"" said Jeanne. ""I wonder then if the little cousin will be able to find them out. If he does he must tell them to me. Are they fairy stories, Marcelline?"""
86,But old Marcelline only smiled.
