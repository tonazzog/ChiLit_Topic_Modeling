1,CHAPTER XXII. MUTINY IN THE CAMP.
2," Hugh John was holding his court under the weeping-elm, and was being visited in detail by his army. The Carters had come over, and, after a vigorous engagement and pursuit, he had even forgiven Sammy for his lack of hardihood in not resisting to the death at the great battle of the Black Sheds."
3,"""But it hurts so confoundedly,"" argued Sammy; ""if it didn't, I shouldn't mind getting killed a bit!"""
4,"""Look at me,"" said Hugh John; ""I'm all over peels and I don't complain."""
5,"""Oh! I dare say--it's all very well for you,"" retorted Sammy, ""you like to fight, and it was you that began the fuss, but I only fight because you'd jolly-well-hammer me if I didn't!"""
6,"""Course I would,"" agreed his officer, ""don't you know that's what generals are for?"""
7,"""Well,"" concluded Sammy Carter, summing the matter up philosophically, ""'tain't my castle anyway."""
8,       *       *       *       *       *
9,"The review was over. In the safe quiet of the elm-tree shelter General Napoleon might have been seen taking his well-earned repose. He was surrounded by his entire following--except, of course, the two Generals of Division, who were engaged in sweeping out the stable-yard. But these were considered socially supernumerary at any rate, except (a somewhat important exception) when there was fighting to be done."
10,"""I don't see that we've done so very much to make a brag about anyhow,"" began Sammy Carter."
11,"General Smith dexterously caught him on the ear with a young turnip, which in company with several friends had wandered in of its own accord from the nearest field on the home farm."
12,"""I should say _you_ didn't do much!"" he sneered pointedly; ""you hooked it as hard as you could after the first skirmish. Why, you haven't got a single sore place about you to show for it."""
13,"""Yes, I have!"" retorted Sammy in high indignation."
14,"[""SAMMY CARTER MUTINOUS.""]"
15,"""Well, let's see it then!"" commanded his general in a kindlier tone."
16,"""Can't--ladies present!"" said Sammy succinctly, into the retreating rear-guard of whose division the triumphant enemy had charged with the pike snatched from his sister's hands."
17,"""All _my_ wounds are in front. _I_ fought and died with my face to the foe!"" said Hugh John in his noblest manner."
18,"""And I d'livered Donald!"" contributed Toady Lion complacently."
19,"""Oh, _that_ ain't anything,"" sneered Sammy Carter, who was not in a good humour. His tone roused General Napoleon, who had the strong family feelings of all the Buonapartes."
20,"""Shut up, Sammy, or I'll come and kick you. None of us did anything except Toady Lion. You ran away, and I got taken prisoner. Toady Lion is the only man among us!"""
21,"""I runned away too--at first,"" confessed the candid Toady Lion, who felt that he had so much real credit that he did not need to take a grain more than he deserved. ""But I comed back quick--and I d'livered Donald out of prison, anyway--I did!"""
22,"Sammy Carter evidently had a sharp retort ready on the tip of his tongue, but he knew well the price he would have to pay for uttering it. Hugh John's eye was upon him, his right hand was closing on a bigger turnip--so Sammy forbore. But he kicked his feet more discontentedly than ever into the turf."
23,"""Well,"" he said, changing the venue of the argument, ""I don't think much of your old castle anyway. My father could have twice as good a castle if he liked----"""
24,"""Oh, 'course he could""--Hugh John's voice was distinctly ironical--""he might plant it on a peaty soil, and grow it from seed in two years; or perhaps he would like a cutting off ours!"""
25,Mr. Davenant Carter was a distinguished agriculturist and florist.
26,"""Don't you speak against my father!"" cried Sammy Carter, glowering at General Napoleon in a way in which privates do not often look at their Commanders-in-Chief."
27,"""Who's touching your father?"" the latter said, a little more soothingly. ""See here, Sammy, you've got your coat on wrong side out to-day. Go home and sleep on it. 'Tisn't my fault if you did run away, and got home before your sister--with a blue place on your back."""
28,"Sammy Carter flung out from under the shelter of the elm and went in search of Prissy, from whom in all his moods he was sure of comfort and understanding. He was a somewhat delicate boy, and generally speaking hated quarrelling as much as she did; but he had a clever tongue, which often brought him into trouble, and, like most other humorists, he did not at all relish a jest at his own expense."
29,"As he went, he was pursued and stung by the brutally unrefined taunts of Hugh John."
30,"""Yes, go on to Prissy; I think she has a spare doll. Go and play at 'house'! It's all you're good for!"""
31,"Thus encouraged by their general, the rest of the company--that is, Cissy and Sir Toady Lion, joined in singing a certain stirring and irritating refrain popular among the youth of Bordershire."
32,"    ""_Lassie-boy, lassie-boy, fie for shame!     Coward's your nature, and Jennie's your name!_"""
33,Sammy Carter stood poised for flight with his eyes blazing with anger.
34,"""You think a lot of your old tumble-down castle; but the town boys have got it in spite of you; and what's more, they've a flag flying on it with 'Down with Smith!' on it. I saw it. Hooray for the town boys!"""
35,And with this Parthian arrow he disappeared at full speed down the avenue.
36,"For a moment Hugh John was paralysed. He tried to pooh-pooh the matter, but he could not but admit that it might very well be true; so he instantly despatched Toady Lion for Prissy, who, as we know, was the fleetest runner of them all. Upon her reporting for duty, the General sent her to bring back word if the state of affairs was as reported."
37,"It was. A large red flag was flying, with the inscription in white upon it, ""Down with Smith!"" while above the inscription there was what looked like a rude attempt at a death's head and crossbones. Hugh John knew this ensign in a moment. Once upon a time, in his wild youth, he had served under it as a pirate on the high seas; but of this he now uttered no word."
38,       *       *       *       *       *
39,"It was in such moments that the true qualities of the born leader came out in General Napoleon Smith. Instantly he dismissed his attendants, put his finger to his forehead, and sat down to draw a map of the campaign in the genuine Napoleonic manner."
40,"At last, after quite a while, he rapped upon the table."
41,"""I have it,"" he cried, ""we must find an ally."" The problem was solved."
