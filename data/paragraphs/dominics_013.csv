1,"CHAPTER 12. THE ""DOMINICAN"" AGAIN."
2,"The circumstances which had attended the publication of the first number of the _Dominican_ had been such as to throw a damper over the future success of that valuable paper.  It was most uncomfortably connected in the minds of the Fifth with the cowardice of Oliver Greenfield, and with the stigma which his conduct had cast upon the whole Form, and they one and all experienced a great diminution of interest in its future."
3,"The Fifth were far more intent on vindicating their reputation with the Sixth--and, indeed, with the rest of the school.  They sought every opportunity of bringing on a collision with the monitors.  One or two of their number went, so far as to pick quarrels with members of the rival class, in hopes of a fight.  But in this they were not successful.  The Sixth chose to look upon this display of feeling among their juniors as a temporary aberration of mind, and were by no means to be tempted into hostilities.  They asserted their authority wherever they could enforce it, and sacrificed it whenever it seemed more discreet to do so.  Only one thing evoked a temporary display of vexation from them, and that was when Ricketts and Braddy appeared one day, arm-in-arm, in the passages with _tall hats_ on their heads.  Now, tall hats on week-days were the exclusive privilege of the Sixth at Saint Dominic's, and, worn by them during school hours, served as the badge of monitorship.  This action on the part of the Fifth, therefore, was as good as a usurpation of monitorial rights, and that the Sixth were not disposed to stand. However, Raleigh, the captain, when appealed to, pooh-poohed the matter. ""Let them be,"" said he; ""what do you want to make a row about it for? If the boys do mistake them for monitors, so much the less row in the passages."""
4,"Raleigh was always a man of peace--though it was rumoured he could, if he chose, thrash any two Dominicans going--and the monitors were much disgusted to find that he did not authorise them to interfere with the Fifth in the matter.  But the Fifth _were_ interfered with in another quarter, and in a way which caused them to drop their chimney-pots completely.  One afternoon the entire Fourth Junior appeared in the corridors in their Sunday tiles!  In their Sunday tiles they slid down the banisters; in their Sunday tiles they played leapfrog; in their Sunday tiles they executed a monster tug-of-war in the bottom corridor! Stephen and Bramble fought their usual battle in top hats, and Master Paul insisted on wearing the same decoration while washing up Oliver's tea-things.  It was a splendid hit, and for once in a way Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles scored one, for the Fifth appeared next day in their ordinary ""boilers,"" and the dignity of the monitors was vindicated."
5,"But the blood was up between Fifth and Sixth, and each Form looked forward to the match, Sixth _versus_ School, with redoubled interest."
6,"""Were not these boys fools?"" some one asks."
7,"To be sure they were, sir.  But what of that? they were none the less boys, and most of them fine young fellows, too, with all their nonsense."
8,"However, as has been said, all this came out of the circumstances which attended the bringing out of the first number of the _Dominican_, and there seemed but a poor look-out for Number 2, which was now nearly due, in consequence."
9,"""What on earth am I to do?"" asked Pembury of Tom Senior one day; ""I've not got a single contribution yet.  There's you making out you're too busy, and Rick the same.  It's all humbug, I know!  What are you busy at I'd like to know?  I never saw you busy yet."""
10,"""Upon my word, old man,"" said Tom, ""I'm awfully sorry, but I've got a tremendous lot to do.  I'm going to try for the French prize; I am, really."""
11,"""And you'll get it, too; rather!  Wasn't it you who translated `I know the way to write' into `_Je non le chemin a writer_' eh?  Oh, stick to French by all means, Tom; it's in your line!  But you might just as well write for Number 2."""
12,"""I really can't this time,"" said Tom."
13,"Ricketts had an excuse very similar.  Bullinger had hurt his foot, he said, and could not possibly write; and Braddy had begun to study fossils, he said, and was bound to devote all his spare time to them. To all of whom Master Pembury gave a piece of his mind."
14,"""Wray, old man,"" said he, that evening, ""you and Noll and I shall have to do the whole thing between us, that's all about it."""
15,"""Awfully sorry!"" said Wraysford; ""you'll have to let me off this time. I'm working like nails for the Nightingale."""
16,"""Bother the Nightingale, I say!  What is it to the _Dominican_?  Come, I say, old man, that won't do! you aren't going to leave me in the lurch like all the rest?"""
17,"But Wraysford was; he would gladly have helped if he could, but he really must not this time; perhaps he would for the next."
18,"Oliver was as bad; he declared the things he had written before--even with Pembury's assistance--had taken him such ages to do, that he wasn't going in for the next number.  He was very sorry to disappoint, and all that; but if Tony was in for a scholarship next Michaelmas he would understand the reason.  Why not let the thing drop this month?"
19,"This, however, by no means met Tony's views.  A pretty figure he would cut if it were to be said he couldn't keep up a paper for two numbers running!  No! his mind was made up.  Number 2 _should_ come out, even if he wrote every word of it himself!  And with that determination he hobbled off to his study.  Here he met Simon waiting for him."
20,"""Oh,"" said the poet; ""I only brought this, if you'll put it in.  I think it's not bad.  I could make it longer if you like.  I find poetry comes so easily, you know!"""
21,"Tony glanced over the paper and grinned.  ""Thanks, awfully!  This will do capitally; it would spoil it to make it any longer.  You're a brick, Simon!  I wish _I_ could write poetry."""
22,"""Oh, never mind.  I could do some more bits about other things, you know, if you like."""
23,"Pembury said he didn't think he should require any more ""bits,"" but was awfully obliged by this one, which was first-rate, a recommendation which sent Simon away happy to his study, there immediately to compose the opening stanza of his famous epic, ""The Sole's Allegery--a sacred Poem."""
24,"With one contribution in hand, Tony locked his door and sat down to write.  There was something out of the common about Pembury.  With the body of a cripple he had the heart of a lion, and difficulties only made it more dauntless.  Any one else would have thought twice, indeed, before undertaking the task he was now setting himself to do, and ninety-nine out of every hundred would have abandoned it before it was half done.  But Tony was indomitable.  Every night that week he locked his study-door, and threats and kicks and entreaties would not open it even to his dearest friends.  And slowly the huge white sheet before him showed the signs of his diligence.  The great long columns, one after another, filled up; paragraph followed paragraph, and article article. He coolly continued the ""History of Saint Dominic's"" begun last month by Bullinger, and the ""Reports of the Sixth Form Debates"" commenced by Tom Senior.  And the ""Diary of the Sixth Form Mouse"" went on just as if Wraysford had never abandoned it; and the poem on the Guinea-pigs, promised in Number 1, by the author of ""To a Tadpole,"" duly appeared also.  Besides this, there were the continuations of Tony's own articles, and his ""Personal Notes,"" and ""Squeaks from Tadpoleopolis,"" and advertisements just as usual; until, in due time, the last column was filled up, the sheet triumphantly fixed in its frame, and as triumphantly hung up on its own particular nails on the wall outside the Fifth Form door."
25,"It was a feat to be proud of, and Tony was justly and pardonably proud. It was at least a gratification next morning to see not only that the school generally took unabated interest in the _Dominican_, but that he had fairly astonished his own class-fellows.  Their admiration of the editor was unbounded and undisguised.  Their consciences had all, more or less, reproached them for backing out of their responsibilities in the way they had; and now it quite touched them to see how, notwithstanding, Anthony had by his own labour made up for their defect, and sustained the reputation of the Fifth before all the school."
26,"The crush outside the door was greater than ever this time, and Master Paul, who again acted as policeman, was obliged to summon Stephen to his assistance in watching to see that no damage came to the precious document."
27,"The account of the Alphabet Match was very graphic, and written quite in the usual absurd ""sporting style,"" greatly to the amusement of most of those who had taken part in it.  Here is a specimen:--"
28,"""At 4.30, sharp, the leather was taken into custody by `Gamey' Raikes, at the wash-house end, who tried what his artful `yorkers' could do in the way of dissolving partnership.  But Teddy Loman kept his willow straight up, and said `Not at home' to every poser, leaving Noll to do all the smacking.  This pretty business might have gone on till to-morrow week had the men's upper stories been as `O.K.' as their timbers, but they messed about over a pretty snick of Noll's, and, after popping the question three times, Teddy got home just in time to see his two bails tumble out of their groove.  Teddy didn't like this, and bowled his partner a wide compliment, which Noll, like a sensible man, didn't walk out to, and Teddy was astonished to find his party could get on without him;"" and so on."
29,"This version of the incident was by no means pleasant to Loman, but to every one else it was highly diverting, and it actually made one or two of the Fifth think that Oliver, after all, had not done such a very discreditable thing in taking that angry word in silence.  If only he had shown more spirit about the blow, they could have forgiven the rest."
30,"Then followed more from the ""Sixth Form Mouse"":--"
31,"""The Sixth held a Cabinet Council to-day to discuss who should go out for nuts.  The choice fell on Callonby.  I wonder why the Sixth are so fond of nuts.  Why, monkeys eat nuts.  Perhaps that is the reason.  What a popular writer Mr Bohn is with the Sixth! they even read him at lesson time!  I was quite sorry when the Doctor had to bone Wren's Bohn. I wonder, by the way, why that bird found it so hard to translate the simplest sentence without his Bohn!  The Doctor really shouldn't--I hope he will restore to Wren his backbone by giving him back his Bohn.  Hum! I heard some one smiling.  I'll go."""
32,"The Sixth, a good many of them, were imprudent enough to look very guilty at the reading of this extract, a circumstance which appeared to afford keenest delight to the Fifth.  But as Simon's poem followed, they had other food for thought at the moment.  The poem was entitled--"
33,  A Revverie.
34,  I.
35,"  I walked me in the garden, all in the garden fair,   And mused upon my hindmost sole all in the open air.   When lo!  I heard above my head a sound all like a wisk,   I stepped me aside thereat out of the way so brisk."
36,"  [Hindmost sole, possibly ""inmost soul""; wisk, possibly ""whisk.""]"
37,  II.
38,"  I looked me up, and there behold! and lo! a window broad,   And out thereof I did dizzern a gallant fishing-rod,   All sporting in the breaze untill the hook in ivy caught,   And then the little lad he tried to pull it harder than he ought."
39,  III.
40,"  It broke, alas! and so messeems fades life's perplecksing dreems,   And vanish like that fishing-rod all in the dark messeems.   I wonder if my perplecksing dreems will vanish like the rod in the   dark,   And I shall rise and rise and rise and rise all like a lark."
41,  IV.
42,"  Oh wood I was a lark, a lark all lofty in the sky,   I do not know what I should do to quench my blazing eye.   I'd look me down on Dominic's, and think of the days when I was young,   Or would I was an infant meek all sucking of my thumb."
43,"Again Simon, who had watched with intense interest the reception of his poem, was perplexed to notice the amusement it had caused.  Even Pembury had mistaken its ""inmost soul,"" for he had placed it in the column devoted to ""Facetiae.""  Nor could Simon understand why, for the next week, every one he met had his thumb in his mouth.  It was very queer-- one of life's mysteries--and he had thoughts of embodying the fact in his ""Sole's Allegery,"" which was now rapidly approaching completion."
44,"After this bubbling up of pure verse there followed a few remarks about Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles, which had the effect of highly incensing those young gentlemen.  The paragraph was entitled--"
45,"""Market Intelligence."
46,"""Half a dozen mixed Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles were offered for sale by auction on the centre landing yesterday.  There was only a small attendance.  The auctioneer said he couldn't honestly recommend the lot, but they must be got rid of at any cost.  He had scrubbed their faces and combed their hair for the occasion, but couldn't guarantee that state of things to last.  But they might turn out to be of use as substitutes in case worms should become scarce; and, any way, by boiling down their fingers and collars, many gallons of valuable ink could be obtained.  The first bid was a farthing, which seemed to be far beyond the expectation of the salesman, who at once knocked the lot down.  The sale was such a success that it is proposed to knock down several more lots in a like manner."""
47,"The rage of the Fourth Junior on reading this paragraph was something awful to witness.  Bramble, feeling he must kick somebody on the legs, kicked Stephen, who, forgetting that he was on police duty, seized Bramble by the hair of his head and rushed off with him to the ""meeting,"" closely followed by Paul and the whole swarm.  That meeting lasted from three to five.  What awful threats were uttered, and what awful vows taken, no one knew.  At five o'clock Stephen's fight with Bramble came off as usual, and all that evening Guinea-pigs and Tadpoles did nothing but make paper darts.  It was certain a crisis had come in their history.  The ""dogs of war"" were let loose!  They would be revenged on somebody!  So they at once began to be revenged on one another, till it should be possible to unite their forces against the common foe."
48,"But the remainder of the crowd stayed on to read one more extract from the _Dominican_.  Under the title of ""Reviews of Books,"" Anthony had reviewed in style the last number of the _Sixth Form Magazine_ as follows:--"
49,"""This book appears to be the praiseworthy attempt of some ambitious little boys to enter the field of letters.  We are always pleased to encourage juvenile talent, but we would suggest that our young friends might have done better had they kept to their picture-books a little longer before launching out into literature on their own account.  In the words of the poet we might say--"
50,"  ""Babies, wait a little longer,   Till the little wings are stronger,   Then you'll fly away."""
51,"""Nevertherless, we would refer to one or two of these interesting attempts.  Take, for example, the essay on the `Character of Julius Caesar,' by one who signs himself Raleigh.  This is very well written. Pains have been taken about the formation of the letters, and some of the capitals are specially worthy of praise.  For one so young, we rarely saw the capital D so well done.  Dr Smith, were he alive, would be pleased to see his remarks on Caesar so well and accurately copied out.  Master Wren gives us some verse--a translation out of Horace.  We wonder if Mr Wren is any relation to the late Jenny Wren who married Mr Cock Robin.  We should imagine from these verses that Mr Wren must be well acquainted with _Robbin_.  Take one more, Master Loman's `A Funny Story.'  We are sorry to find Master Loman tells stories.  Boys shouldn't tell stories; it's not right.  But Master Loman unfortunately does tell stories, and this is one.  He calls it `A Funny Story.'  That is a story to begin with, for it is not funny.  We don't know what Master Loman thinks funny; perhaps he calls being run out at cricket funny, or hitting another boy in the mouth when he's looking another way.  In any case, we can't make out why he calls this story funny.  The only funny thing about it is its title, and his spelling `attach' `attatch.'  The last is really funny.  It shows how partial Mr Loman is to _tea_.  If this funny story is the result of his partiality to tea, we are afraid it was very weak stuff."""
52,"Loman, who had already been made dreadfully uncomfortable by Simon's poem, made no secret of his rage over this number of the _Dominican_. He was one of those vain fellows who cannot see a jest where it is levelled at themselves.  The rest of the Sixth had the sense, whatever they felt, to laugh at Anthony's hard hits.  But not so Loman; he lost his temper completely.  He ordered the _Dominican_ to be taken down; he threatened to report the whole Fifth to the Doctor.  He would not allow the junior boys to stand and read it.  In short, he made a regular ass of himself."
53,"Undoubtedly Anthony had put a great deal of venom into his pen.  Still, by taking all the poison and none of the humour to himself Loman made a great mistake, and displayed a most unfortunate amount of weakness."
54,"He shut himself up in his study in a fume; he boxed Stephen's ears for nothing at all, and would see no one for the rest of the evening.  He knew well he could not have given his enemies a greater crow over him than such conduct, and yet he could not command his vanity to act otherwise."
55,"But that evening, just before tea-time, something happened which gave Loman more to think about than the _Dominican_.  A letter marked ""Immediate"" came to him by the post.  It was from Cripps, to say that, after all, Sir Patrick _had_ won the Derby!"
