1,CHAPTER 50.
2,"After dinner they resumed their labour.  ""I wonder what's in this case?"" said Mr Seagrave, pointing to the first at hand.  Ready set to work with his axe, and broke off the lid, and found a number of pasteboard boxes full of tapes, narrow ribbons, stay-laces, whalebones, and cottons on reels."
3,"""This has been sent out for some Botany Bay milliner,"" said Mr Seagrave.  ""I presume, however, we must confiscate it for the benefit of Mrs Seagrave and Miss Caroline.  We will take them to them as soon as we have time."""
4,"The next was a box without a lock; the lid was forced up, and they found a dozen half-gallon square bottles of gin stored in divisions."
5,"""That's Hollands, sir, I know,"" said Ready; ""what shall we do with it?"""
6,"""We will not destroy it, Ready, but at the same time we will not use it but as a medicine,"" replied Mr Seagrave; ""we have been so long used to spring-water, that it would be a pity to renew a taste for spirituous liquors."""
7,"""I trust we shall never want to drink a drop of it, sir, either as a medicine or otherwise.  Now for this cask with wooden hoops."""
8,"The head was soon out, and discovered a dinner set of painted china with gold edges."
9,"""This, Mr Seagrave, may be useful, for we are rather short of plates and dishes.  Common white would have served as well."""
10,"""And be more suitable with our present outfit,"" replied Mr Seagrave."
11,"""Here's a box with your name on it, sir,"" said Ready; ""do you know what is in it?"""
12,"""I have no idea, Ready; but your axe will decide the point."""
13,"When the box was opened, everything appeared in a sad mouldy state from the salt water which had penetrated; but on removing the brown paper and pasteboard, it was found to contain stationery of all sorts, and, except on the outside, it was very little injured."
14,"""This is indeed a treasure, Ready.  I recollect now; this is paper, pens, and everything requisite for writing, besides children's books, copy-books, paint-boxes, and a great many other articles in the stationery line."""
15,"""Well, sir, that is fortunate.  Now we may set up our school, and as the whole population of the island will attend it, it will really be a National School."""
16,"""Very true, Ready.  Now for that cask."""
17,"""I can tell what that is by the outside; it is oil, and very acceptable, for our candles are nearly out.  Now we come to the most valuable of all our property."""
18,"""What is that, Ready?"""
19,"""All the articles which I brought on shore in the different trips I took in the boat before the ship went to pieces; for you see, sir, iron don't swim, and, therefore, what I looked after most was ironware of all sorts, and tools.  Here are three kegs of small nails, besides two bags of large, and there are several axes, hammers, and other tools, besides hanks of twine, sailing needles, and bees'-wax."""
20,"""They are indeed valuable, Ready."""
21,"""Here's some more of my plunder, as the Americans say.  All these are wash-deck buckets, this a small harness cask for salting meat, and here's the cook's wooden trough for making bread, which will please Miss Juno; and in it, you see, I have put all the galley-hooks, ladles, and spoons, and the iron trivets, and here's two lamps.  I think I put some cotton wicks somewhere--I know I did; we shall find them by and by. Here's the two casks, one of cartridges made up, and the other of gunpowder, and the other six muskets."""
22,"""These are really treasures, Ready, and yet how well we have done without them."""
23,"""Very true, sir, but we shall do better with them, and when we fit up the storehouse for a dwelling, Mr Seagrave, we shall be able to make it a little more comfortable in every respect than the present one; for you see there, all the fir-planking and deals, which William and I buried in the sand."""
24,"""I really had quite forgotten them, Ready.  If I could but get the fear of the savages coming over out of my head, I really think we might live very comfortably even on this island."""
25,"""Do you know, Mr Seagrave, I am glad to hear you say that, for it proves that you are more contented and resigned than you were."""
26,"""I am so, Ready--at least I think so; but perhaps it is, that the immediate danger from the savages so fills my thoughts, that I no longer dwell so much upon our being taken off the island."""
27,"""I dare say it is as you state, sir; but now let us go on with our search.  Here are the ship's compasses, and deep sea line and reel, also the land lead.  The stuff will be very useful for our little boat."""
28,"""And I am very glad of the compasses, Ready; for with them I shall be able to make a sort of survey of the island, when I have a little time. Your pocket compass is too small for surveying.  I shall take some bearings now, while I am here, as I may not be back again very soon."""
29,"""Well, sir, I think if we open this other case, which I perceive has your name on it, it will be as much as we need do to-day, for the sun is going down; we can then make up some kind of bed, eat our suppers, and go to sleep."""
30,"""I am very tired, Ready, and shall be glad to do as you propose.  That case contains books; but what portion of my library I do not know."""
31,"""But you soon will, sir,"" replied Ready, wrenching it open with his axe. ""They are a little stained on the outside, but they are jammed so tight that they do not appear to have suffered much.  Here are one or two, sir."""
32,"""Plutarch's Lives.  I am glad I have them: they are excellent reading for young or old; there is no occasion to open any more, as I know all the other books in the case are `History'; perhaps the best case which could have been saved."""
