1,CHAPTER XI. ENEMY'S COUNTRY.
2," He presently came to the wooden bridge and crossed it. He was now on the outskirts of the town, and in enemy's country. So, more from etiquette than precaution, he took the shelter of a wall, glided through a plantation, among the withy roots of which his foot presently caught in a brass ""grin,"" or rabbit's snare. Hugh John grubbed it up gratefully and pocketed it. He had no objections whatever to spoiling the Egyptians."
3,"He was now in butcher Donnan's pastures, where many fore-doomed sheep, in all the bliss of ignorance, waited their turns to be made into mutton. Very anxiously Hugh John scrutinised each one. He wandered round and round till he had made certain that Donald was not there."
4,"At the foot of the pasture were certain black-pitched wooden sheds set in a square, with a little yard like a church pew in the midst. Somewhere here, he knew, slept Donnan's slaughterman, and it was possible that in this place Donald might be held in captivity."
5,"Now it was an accomplishment of our hero's that he could bleat like any kind of sheep--except perhaps an old tup, for which his voice was as yet too shrill. In happy, idle days he had elaborated a code of signals with Donald, and was well accustomed to communicating with him from his bedroom window. So now he crouched in the dusk of the hedge, and said ""Maa-aaa!"" in a tone of reproach."
6,"Instantly a little answering bleat came from the black sheds, a sound which made Hugh's heart beat faster. Still he could not be quite sure. He therefore bleated again more pleadingly, and again there came back the answer, choked and feeble indeed, but quite obviously the voice of his own dear Donald. Hugh John cast prudence to the winds. He raced round and climbed the bars into the enclosure, calling loudly, ""Donald! Donald!"""
7,"But hardly had his feet touched the ground when a couple of dogs flew at him from the corner of the yard, and he had scarcely time to get on the top of a stone wall before they were clamouring and yelping beneath him. Hugh John crouched on his ""hunkers"" (as he called the posture in which one sits on a wall when hostile dogs are leaping below), and seizing a large coping-stone he dropped it as heavily as he could on the head of the nearer and more dangerous. A howl most lamentable immediately followed. Then a man's voice cried, ""Down, Towser! What's the matter, Grip? Sic' them! Good dogs!"""
8,"It was the voice of the slaughterman, roused from his slumbers, and in fear of tramps or other midnight marauders upon his master's premises."
9,"Hugh ran on all fours along the wall to the nearest point of the woods, dropped over, and with a leaping, anxious heart sped in the direction of home. He crossed the bridge in safety, but as he ran across the island he could hear the dogs upon the trail and the encouraging shouts of his pursuer. The black looming castle fell swiftly behind him. Now he was at the stepping-stones, over which he seemed to float rather than leap, so completely had fear added to his usual strength wings of swiftness."
10,"But at the farther side the dogs were close upon him. He was obliged to climb a certain low tree, where he had often sat dangling his legs and swinging in the branches while he allowed Prissy to read to him."
11,"The dogs were soon underneath, and he could see them leaping upward with snapping white teeth which gleamed unpleasantly through the darkness. But their furious barking was promptly answered. Hugh John could hear a heavy tread approaching among the dense foliage of the trees. A dark form suddenly appeared in the glade and poised something at its shoulder.--Flash! There came a deafening report, the thresh of leaden drops, a howl of pain from the dogs, and both of them took their way back towards the town with not a few bird shot in their flanks."
12,"Hugh John's heart stood still as the dark figure advanced. He feared it might prove to be his father. Instead it was Tom Cannon, and the brave scout on the tree heaved a sigh of relief."
13,"""Who's up there?"" cried the under-keeper gruffly; ""come down this moment and show yourself, you dirty poacher, or by Heaven I'll shoot you sitting!"""
14,"""All right, Tom, I'm coming as fast as I can,"" said Hugh John, beginning to clamber down."
15,"""Heavens and earth, Master Hugh--what be you doing here? Whatever will master say?"""
16,"""He won't say anything, for he won't know, Tom Cannon."" said Hugh John confidently."
17,"""Oh yes, he will,"" said the keeper. ""I won't have you bringing a pack of dogs into my covers at twelve of the clock--blow me if I will!"""
18,"""Well, you won't tell my father, anyway!"" said Hugh John calmly, dusting himself as well as he could."
19,"""And why not?"" asked the keeper indignantly."
20,"""'Cause if you do, I'll tell where I saw you kissing Jane Housemaid an hour ago!"""
21,"Now this was at once a guess and an exaggeration. Hugh John had not seen all this, but he felt rather than knew that the permitted arm about Jane Housemaid's waist could have no other culmination. Also he had a vague sense that this was the most irritating thing he could say in the circumstances."
22,"At any rate Tom Cannon fairly gasped with astonishment. A double-jointed word slipped between his teeth, which sounded like ""Hang that boy!"" At last his seething thoughts found utterance."
23,"""You young imp of Satan--it ain't true, anyway."""
24,"""All right, you can tell my father that!"" said Hugh John coolly, feeling the strength of his position."
25,"Tom Cannon was not much frightened for himself, but he did not wish to get Jane Housemaid into any trouble, for, as he well knew, that young woman had omitted to ask for leave of absence. So he only said, ""All right, it's none of my business if you wander over every acre, and break your neck off every tree on the blame estate. But you'd better be getting home before master comes out and catches you himself! Then you'd eat strap, my lad!"""
26,"So having remade the peace, Tom escorted Hugh John back to the dog kennel with great good nature, and even gave him a leg up to the roof above the palace of CÃ¦sar."
27,"Hugh John paused as he put one foot into the bedroom, heavy and yet homelike with the night smell of a sleeping house. Toady Lion had fallen out of bed and lay, still with his blanket wrapped round him like a martial cloak, half under his cot and half on the floor. But this he did every other night. Prissy was breathing quietly in the next room. All was safe."
28,"Hugh John called softly down, ""Tom, Tom!"""
29,"""What now?"" returned the keeper, who had been spying along the top windows to distinguish a certain one dear to his heart."
30,"""I say, Tom--I'll tell Jane Housemaid to-morrow that you're a proper brick."""
31,"""Thank'ee, sir!"" said Tom, saluting gravely and turning off across the lawn towards the ""bothy,"" where among the pine woods he kept his owl-haunted bachelor quarters."
