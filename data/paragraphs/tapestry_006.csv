1,CHAPTER VI. THE SONG OF THE SWAN.
2,"                  ""----If I were on that shore,           I should live there and not die, but sing evermore.""                                              JEAN INGELOW."
3," ""About here will do, I should think--eh, Monsieur Frog?"" said Hugh, resting on his oars half-way to the island. But there was no answer. The frog had disappeared."
4,"""What a queer way all these creatures behave, don't they, Jeanne?"" he said. ""First Dudu, then Houpet and the others. They go off all of a sudden in the oddest way."""
5,"""I suppose they have to go when we don't need them any more,"" said Jeanne. ""I daresay they are obliged to."""
6,"""Who obliges them?"" said Hugh."
7,"""Oh, I don't know! The fairies, I suppose,"" said Jeanne."
8,"""Was it the fairies you meant when you kept saying 'they'?"" asked Hugh."
9,"""I don't know--perhaps--it's no use asking me,"" said Jeanne. ""Fairies, or dream-spirits, or something like that. Never mind who they are if they give us nice things. I am sure the frogs have been _very_ kind, haven't they?"""
10,"""Yes; you won't be so afraid of them now, will you, Jeanne?"""
11,"""Oh, I don't know. I daresay I shall be, for they're quite different from _our_ frogs. Ours aren't so bright green, and their eyes aren't red, and they can't _talk_. Oh no, our frogs are quite different from _theirs_, Chéri,"" she added with profound conviction."
12,"""Just like our trees and everything else, I suppose,"" said Hugh. ""Certainly this is a funny country. But hush, Jeanne! I believe the concert's going to begin."""
13,"They sat perfectly still to listen, but for a minute or two the sound which had caught Hugh's attention was not repeated. Everything about them was silent, except that now and then a soft faint breeze seemed to flutter across the water, slightly rippling its surface as it passed. The strange, even light which had shone over all the scene ever since the children had stepped out at the hillside door had now grown paler: it was not now bright enough to distinguish more than can be seen by an autumn twilight. The air was fresh and clear, though not the least cold; the drooping forms of the low-hanging branches of the island trees gave the children a melancholy feeling when they glanced in that direction."
14,"""I don't like this very much,"" said Jeanne. ""It makes me sad, and I wanted to have fun."""
15,"""It must be sad for the poor swan if it's going to die,"" said Hugh. ""But I don't mind this sort of sad feeling. I think it's rather nice. Ah! Jeanne, listen, there it is again. They must be going to begin."""
16,"""It"" was a low sort of ""call"" which seemed to run round the shores of the lake like a preliminary note, and then completely died away. Instantly began from all sides the most curious music that Hugh and Jeanne had ever heard. It was croaking, but croaking in unison and regular time, and harsh as it was, there was a very strange charm about it--quite impossible to describe. It sounded pathetic at times, and at times monotonous, and yet inspiriting, like the beating of a drum; and the children listened to it with actual enjoyment. It went on for a good while, and then stopped as suddenly as it had begun; and then again, after some minutes of perfect silence, it recommenced in a low and regular chant--if such a word can be used for croaking--a steady, regular croak, croak, as if an immense number of harsh-sounding instruments were giving forth one note in such precise tune and measure that the harshness was softened and lost by the union of sound. It grew lower and lower, seeming almost to be about to die altogether away, when, from another direction--from the tree-shaded island in the centre of the lake--rose, low and faint at first, gathering strange strength as it mounted ever higher and higher, the song of the swan."
17,"The children listened breathlessly and in perfect silence to the wonderful notes which fell on their ears--notes which no words of mine could describe, for in themselves they were words, telling of suffering and sorrow, of beautiful things and sad things, of strange fantastic dreams, of sunshine and flowers and summer days, of icy winds from the snow-clad hills, and days of dreariness and solitude. Each and all came in their turn; but, at the last, all melted, all grew rather, into one magnificent song of bliss and triumph, of joyful tenderness and brilliant hope, too pure and perfect to be imagined but in a dream. And as the last clear mellow notes fell on the children's ears, a sound of wings seemed to come with them, and gazing ever more intently towards the island they saw rising upwards the pure white snow-like bird--upwards and upwards, ever higher, till at last, with the sound of its own joyous song, it faded and melted into the opal radiance of the calm sky above."
18,"For long the children gazed after it--a spot of light seemed to linger for some time in the sky just where it had disappeared--almost, to their fancy, as if the white swan was resting there, again to return to earth. But it was not so. Slowly, like the light of a dying star, the brightness faded; there was no longer a trace of the swan's radiant flight; again a soft low breeze, like a farewell sigh, fluttered across the lake, and the children withdrew their eyes from the sky and looked at each other."
19,"""Jeanne!"" said Hugh."
20,"""Chéri!"" said Jeanne."
21,"""What was it? Was it not an angel, and not a swan?"""
22,Jeanne shook her little head in perplexity.
23,"""I don't know,"" she said. ""It was wonderful. Did you hear all it told, Chéri?"""
24,"""Yes,"" said Hugh. ""But no one could ever tell it again, Jeanne. It is a secret for us."""
25,"""And for the frogs,"" added Jeanne."
26,"""And for the frogs,"" said Hugh."
27,"""But,"" said Jeanne, ""I thought the swan was going to die. _That_ was not dying."""
28,"""Yes,"" said the queer croaking voice of the frog, suddenly reappearing on the edge of the boat; ""yes, my children,"" he repeated, with a strange solemnity, ""for such as the swan that _is_ dying. And now once more--for you will never see me again, nor revisit this country--once again, my children, I bid you farewell."""
29,"He waved his hands in adieu, and hopped away."
30,"""Chéri,"" said Jeanne, after a short silence, ""I feel rather sad, and a very little sleepy. Do you think I might lie down a little--it is not the least cold--and take a tiny sleep? You might go to sleep too, if you like. I should think there will be time before we row back to the shore, only I do not know how we shall get the boat through the narrow part if the frogs have all gone. And no doubt Houpet and the others will be wondering why we are so long."""
31,"""We can whistle for Dudu again if we need,"" said Hugh. ""He helped us very well the last time. I too am rather sleepy, Jeanne, but still I think I had better not go _quite_ asleep. You lie down, and I'll just paddle on very slowly and softly for a little, and when you wake up we'll fix whether we should whistle or not."""
32,"Jeanne seemed to fall asleep in a moment when she lay down. Hugh paddled on quietly, as he had said, thinking dreamily of the queer things they had seen and heard in this nameless country inside the tapestry door. He did not feel troubled as to how they were to get back again; he had great faith in Dudu, and felt sure it would all come right. But gradually he too began to feel very sleepy; the dip of the oars and the sound of little Jeanne's regular breathing seemed to keep time together in a curious way. And at last the oars slipped from Hugh's hold; he lay down beside Jeanne, letting the boat drift; he was so _very_ sleepy, he could keep up no more."
33,"But after a minute or two when, not _quite_ asleep, he lay listening to the soft breathing of the little girl, it seemed to him he heard still the gentle dip of the oars. The more he listened, the more sure he became that it was so, and at last his curiosity grew so great that it half overcame his drowsiness. He opened his eyes just enough to look up. Yes, he was right, the boat was gliding steadily along, the oars were doing their work, and who do you think were the rowers? Dudu on one side, Houpet on the other, rowing away as cleverly as if they had never done anything else in their lives, steadying themselves on one claw, rowing with the other. Hugh did not feel the least surprised; he smiled sleepily, and turned over quite satisfied."
34,"""They'll take us safe back,"" he said to himself: and that was all he thought about it."
35,"""Good-night, Chéri, good-night,"" was the next thing he heard, or remembered hearing."
36,Hugh half sat up and rubbed his eyes.
37,Where was he?
38,"Not in the boat, there was no sound of oars, the light that met his gaze was not that of the strange country where Jeanne and he had had all these adventures, it was just clear ordinary moonlight; and as for where he was, he was lying on the floor of the tapestry room close to the part of the wall where stood, or hung, the castle with the long flight of steps, which Jeanne and he had so wished to enter. And from the other side of the tapestry--from inside the castle, one might almost say--came the voice he had heard in his sleep, the voice which seemed to have awakened him."
39,"""Good-night, Chéri,"" it said, ""good-night. I have gone home the other way."""
40,"""Jeanne, Jeanne, where are you? Wait!"" cried Hugh, starting to his feet. But there was no reply."
41,"Hugh looked all round. The room seemed just the same as usual, and if he had looked out of the window, though this he did not know, he would have seen the old raven on the terrace marching about, and, in his usual philosophical way, failing the sunshine, enjoying the moonlight; while down in the chickens' house, in the corner of the yard, Houpet and his friends were calmly roosting; fat little Nibble soundly sleeping in his cage, cuddled up in the hay; poor, placid Grignan reposing in his usual corner under the laurel bush. All these things Hugh would have seen, and would no doubt have wondered much at them. But though neither tired nor cold, he was still sleepy, very sleepy, so, after another stare all round, he decided that he would defer further inquiry till the morning, and in the meantime follow the advice of Jeanne's farewell ""good-night."""
42,"And ""after all,"" he said to himself, as he climbed up into his comfortable bed, ""after all, bed is very nice, even though that little carriage was awfully jolly, and the boat almost better. What fun it will be to talk about it all to-morrow morning with Jeanne."""
43,"It was rather queer when to-morrow morning came--when he woke to find it had come, at least; it was rather queer to see everything looking just the same as on other to-morrow mornings. Hugh had not time to think very much about it, for it had been Marcelline's knock at the door that had wakened him, and she told him it was rather later than usual. Hugh, however, was so eager to see Jeanne and talk over with her their wonderful adventures that he needed no hurrying. But, to his surprise, when he got to Jeanne's room, where as usual their ""little breakfast"" was prepared for them on the table by the fire, Jeanne was seated on her low chair, drinking her coffee in her every-day manner, not the least different from what she always was, not in any particular hurry to see him, nor, apparently, with anything particular to say."
44,"""Well, Chéri,"" she said, merrily, ""you are rather late this morning. Have you slept well?"""
45,"Hugh looked at her; there was no mischief in her face; she simply meant what she said. In his astonishment, Hugh rubbed his eyes and then stared at her again."
46,"""Jeanne,"" he said, quite bewildered."
47,"""Well, Chéri,"" she repeated, ""what is the matter? How funny you look!"" and in her turn Jeanne seemed surprised."
48,Hugh looked round; old Marcelline had left the room.
49,"""Jeanne,"" he said, ""it is so queer to see you just the same as usual, with nothing to say about it all."""
50,"""About all what?"" said Jeanne, seemingly more and more puzzled."
51,"""About our adventures--the drive in the carriage, with Houpet as coachman, and the stair down to the frog's country, and the frogs and the boat, and the concert, and O Jeanne! the song of the swan."""
52,Jeanne opened wide her eyes.
53,"""Chéri!"" she said, ""you've been dreaming all these funny things."""
54,Hugh was so hurt and disappointed that he nearly began to cry.
55,"""O Jeanne,"" he said, ""it is very unkind to say that,"" and he turned away quite chilled and perplexed."
56,Jeanne ran after him and threw her arms round his neck.
57,"""Chéri, Chéri,"" she said, ""I didn't mean to vex you, but I _don't_ understand."""
58,Hugh looked into her dark eyes with his earnest blue ones.
59,"""Jeanne,"" he said, ""don't you remember _any_ of it--don't you remember the trees changing their colours so prettily?--don't you remember the frogs' banquet?"""
60,Jeanne stared at him so earnestly that she quite frowned.
61,"""I think--I think,"" she said, and then she stopped. ""When you say that of the trees, I think I did see rainbow colours all turning into each other. I think, Chéri, part of me was there and part not; can there be two of me, I wonder? But please, Chéri, don't ask me any more. It puzzles me so, and then perhaps I may say something to vex you. Let us play at our day games now, Chéri, and never mind about the other things. But if you go anywhere else like that, ask the fairies to take me too, for I always like to be with you, you know, Chéri."""
62,"So they kissed and made friends. But still it seemed very queer to Hugh. Till now Jeanne had always been eager to talk about the tapestry castle, and full of fancies about Dudu and Houpet and the rest of the animals, and anxious to hear Hugh's dreams. Now she seemed perfectly content with her every-day world, delighted with a new and beautiful china dinner-service which her godmother had sent her, and absorbed in cooking all manner of wonderful dishes for a grand dolls' feast, for which she was sending invitations to all her dolls, young and old, ugly and pretty, armless, footless, as were some, in the perfection of Parisian toilettes as were others. For she had, like most only daughters, an immense collection of dolls, though she was not as fond of them as many little girls."
63,"""I thought you didn't much care for dolls. It was one of the things I liked you for at the first,"" said Hugh, in a slightly aggrieved tone of voice. Lessons were over, and the children were busy at the important business of cooking the feast. Hugh didn't mind the cooking; he had even submitted to a paper cap which Jeanne had constructed for him on the model of that of the ""chef"" downstairs; he found great consolation in the beating up an egg which Marcelline had got for them as a great treat, and immense satisfaction in watching the stewing, in one of Jeanne's toy pans on the nursery fire, of a preparation of squashed prunes, powdered chocolate, and bread crumbs, which was to represent a ""ragout à la""--I really do not remember what."
64,"""I thought you didn't care for dolls, Jeanne,"" Hugh repeated. ""It would be ever so much nicer to have all the animals at our feast. We could put them on chairs all round the table. That _would_ be some fun."""
65,"""They wouldn't sit still one minute,"" said Jeanne. ""How funny you are to think of such a thing, Chéri! Of course it would be fun if they _would_, but fancy Dudu and Grignan helping themselves with knives and forks like people."""
66,"Jeanne burst out laughing at the idea, and laughed so heartily that Hugh could not help laughing too. But all the same he said to himself,"
67,"""I'm sure Dudu and the others _could_ sit at the table and behave like ladies and gentlemen if they chose. How _very_ funny of Jeanne to forget about all the clever things they did! But it is no use saying any more to her. It would only make us quarrel. There must be two Jeannes, or else 'they,' whoever they are, make her forget on purpose."""
68,"And as Hugh, for all his fancifulness, was a good deal of a philosopher, he made up his mind to amuse himself happily with little Jeanne as she was. The feast was a great success. The dolls behaved irreproachably, with which their owner was rather inclined to twit Hugh, when, just at the end of the banquet, greatly to his satisfaction, a certain Mademoiselle Zéphyrine, a blonde with flaxen ringlets and turquoise blue eyes, suddenly toppled over, something having no doubt upset her equilibrium, and fell flat on her nose on the table."
69,"""Ah!"" cried Jeanne, greatly concerned, ""my poor Zéphyrine has fainted,"" and, rushing forward to her assistance, worse results followed. Mesdames Lili and Joséphine, two middle-aged ladies somewhat the worse for wear, overcome by the distressing spectacle, _or_ by the sleeve of Jeanne's dress as she leant across them, fell off their chairs too--one, like Zéphyrine, on to the table, the other on to the floor, dragging down with her the plateful of ragout in front of her, while her friend's sudden descent upon the table completed the general knockings over and spillings which Zéphyrine had begun."
70,"""Oh dear! oh dear!"" cried Jeanne; ""all the chocolate ragout is spilt, and the whipped-up egg is mixed with the orange-juice soup. Oh dear! oh dear! and I thought we should have had the whole feast to eat up ourselves after the dolls had had enough."""
71,"""Yes,"" said Hugh, ""that's what comes of having stupid sticks of dolls at your feasts. The _animals_ wouldn't have behaved like that."""
72,"But, seeing that poor Jeanne was really in tears at this unfortunate termination of her entertainment, he left off teasing her, and having succeeded in rescuing some remains of the good things, they sat down on the floor together and ate them up very amicably."
73,"""I don't think I _do_ care much for dolls,"" said Jeanne meditatively, when she had munched the last crumbs of the snipped-up almonds, which were supposed to represent some very marvellous dish. (""I like almonds terribly--don't you, Chéri?"") she added, as a parenthesis. ""No, I don't care for dolls. You are quite right about them; they _are_ stupid, and you can't make fancies about them, because their faces always have the same silly look. I don't know what I like playing at best. O Marcelline!"" she exclaimed, as the old nurse just then came into the room, ""O Marcelline! _do_ tell us a story; we are tired of playing."""
74,"""Does Monsieur Chéri, too, wish me tell him a story?"" asked Marcelline, looking curiously at Hugh."
75,"""Yes, of course,"" said Hugh. ""Why do you look at me that funny way, Marcelline?"""
76,"""Why,"" said Marcelline, smiling, ""I was thinking only that perhaps Monsieur finds so many stories in the tapestry that he would no longer care for my stupid little old tales."""
77,"Hugh did not answer. He was wondering to himself what Marcelline really meant; whether she knew of the wonders concealed behind the tapestry, or was only teasing him a little in the kind but queer way she sometimes did."
78,"""Marcelline,"" he said suddenly at last, ""I don't understand you."""
79,"""Do you understand yourself, my little Monsieur?"" said Marcelline. ""Do any of us understand ourselves? all the different selves that each of us is?"""
80,"""No,"" said Hugh, ""I daresay we don't. It is very puzzling; it's all very puzzling."""
81,"""In the country where I lived when I was a little girl,"" began Marcelline, but Jeanne interrupted her."
82,"""Have you never been there since, Marcelline?"" she asked."
83,Marcelline smiled again her funny smile.
84,"""Oh dear, yes,"" she said; ""often, very often. I should not have been near so happy as I am if I had not often visited that country."""
85,"""Dear me,"" exclaimed Jeanne, ""how very queer! I had no idea of that. You haven't been there for a great many years any way, Marcelline. I heard mamma telling a lady the other day that she never remembered your going away, not even for a day--never since she was born."""
86,"""Ah!"" said Marcelline, ""but, Mademoiselle, we don't always know what even those nearest us do. I might have gone to that country without your mamma knowing. Sometimes we are far away when those beside us think us close to them."""
87,"""Yes,"" said Hugh, looking up suddenly, ""that is true, Marcelline."""
88,"What she said made him remember Dudu's remark about Jeanne the night before, that she was far, far away, and he began to feel that Marcelline understood much that she seldom alluded to."
89,But Jeanne took it up differently. She jumped on to Marcelline's knee and pretended to beat her.
90,"""You naughty little old woman,"" she said; ""you very naughty little old woman, to say things like that to puzzle me--just what you know I don't like. Go back to your own country, naughty old Marcelline; go back to your fairyland, or wherever it was you came from, if you are going to tease poor little Jeanne so."""
91,"""_Tease_ you, Mademoiselle?"" Marcelline repeated."
92,"""Yes, tease me,"" insisted Jeanne. ""You know I hate people to go on about things I don't understand. Now you're to tell us a story at once, do you hear, Marcelline?"""
93,"Hugh said nothing, but he looked up in Marcelline's face with his grave blue eyes, and the old woman smiled again. She seemed as if she was going to speak, when just then a servant came upstairs to say that Jeanne's mother wished the children to go downstairs to her for a little. Jeanne jumped up, delighted to welcome any change."
94,"""You must keep the story for another day, Marcelline,"" she said, as she ran out of the room."
95,"""I am getting too old to tell stories,"" said Marcelline, half to herself, half to Hugh, who was following his cousin more slowly. He stopped for a moment."
96,"""Too old?"" he repeated."
97,"""Yes, Monsieur Chéri, too old,"" the nurse replied. ""The thoughts do not come so quickly as they once did, and the words, too, hobble along like lamesters on crutches."""
98,"""But,"" said Hugh, half timidly, ""it is never--you would never, I mean, be too old to visit that country, where there are so many stories to be found?"""
99,"""Perhaps not,"" said Marcelline, ""but even if I found them, I might not be able to tell them. Go and look for them for yourself, Monsieur Chéri; you have not half seen the tapestry castle yet."""
100,"But when Hugh would have asked her more she would not reply, only smiled and shook her head. So the boy went slowly downstairs after Jeanne, wondering what old Marcelline could mean, half puzzled and half pleased."
101,"""Only,"" he said to himself, ""if I get into the castle, Jeanne really must come with me, especially if it is to hear stories."""
102,
103, CHAPTER VII WINGS AND CATS.
104,"          ""And all their cattish gestures plainly spoke            They thought the affair they'd come upon no joke.""                                          CHARLES LAMB."
105," Some days went on, and nothing more was said by the children about the adventures which had so puzzled poor Hugh. After a while he seemed to lose the wish to talk about them to little Jeanne; or rather, he began to feel as if he could not, that the words would not come, or that if they did, they would not tell what he wanted. He thought about the strange things he had seen very often, but it was as if he had read of them rather than as if he had seen and heard them, or as if they had happened to some one else. Whenever he saw Dudu and Houpet and the rest of the pets, he looked at them at first in a half dreamy way, wondering if they too were puzzled about it all, or if, being really fairies, they did not find anything to puzzle them! The only person (for, after all, he could often not prevent himself from looking upon all the animals as persons)--the only person who he somehow felt sure _did_ understand him, was Marcelline, and this was a great satisfaction. She said nothing; she almost never even smiled in what Jeanne called her ""funny"" way; but there was just a very tiny little undersound in the tone of her voice sometimes, a little wee smile in her eyes more than on her lips, that told Hugh that, fairy or no fairy, old Marcelline knew all about it, and it pleased him to think so."
106,One night when Hugh was warmly tucked up in bed Marcelline came in as usual before he went to sleep to put out his light.
107,"""There's been no moonlight for a good while Marcelline, has there?"" he said."
108,"""No, Monsieur, there has not,"" said Marcelline."
109,"""Will it be coming back soon?"" asked Hugh."
110,"""Do you like it so much, my child?"" said the old nurse. She had a funny way of sometimes answering a question by asking another."
111,"""Yes,"" said Hugh. ""At least, of course when I'm fast asleep it doesn't matter to me if it's moonlight or not. But you know what I like it for, Marcelline, and you said the other day that I hadn't half seen the tapestry castle, and I want very much to see it, Marcelline, only I'd like Jeanne to be with me; for I don't think I could tell her well about the fairy things if she hadn't been with me. She didn't seem to understand the words, and I don't think I could get the right ones to tell, do you know, Marcelline?"""
112,"He half sat up in bed, resting his head on his elbow, which was leaning on the pillow, and looking up in the old woman's face with his earnest blue eyes. Marcelline shook her head slowly."
113,"""No,"" she said, ""you're right. The words wouldn't come, and if they did, it would be no use. You're older than Mademoiselle Jeanne, Monsieur Hugh, and it's different for her. But it doesn't matter--the days bring their own pleasures and interests, which the moonlight wouldn't suit. You wouldn't have cared for a dinner like what you have every day when you were listening to the song of the swan?"""
114,"""No, certainly not,"" said Hugh. ""I see you do understand, Marcelline, better than anybody. It must be as I said; there must be two of me, and two of Jeanne, and two of you, and----"""
115,"""And two of everything,"" said Marcelline; ""and the great thing is to keep each of the twos in its right place."""
116,"She smiled now, right out, and was turning away with the light in her hand, when Hugh called after her,"
117,"""_Will_ the moonlight nights come again soon, Marcelline? Do tell me. I'm sure you know."""
118,"""Have a little patience,"" said the old nurse, ""you shall be told. Never fear."""
119,"And, a little inclined to be _im_patient, Hugh was nevertheless obliged to shut his eyes and go to sleep. There was no moonlight _that_ night any way."
120,But not many nights after there came a great surprise.
121,"Curiously enough Hugh had gone to sleep _that_ night without any thought of tapestry adventures. He and Jeanne had been very merry indeed; they had been dressing up, and playing delightful tricks--such as tapping at the salon door, and on being told to come in, making their appearance like two very, very old peasants, hobbling along on sticks--Jeanne with a cap and little knitted shawl of Marcelline's, Hugh with a blouse and cotton nightcap, so that Jeanne's mother quite jumped at first sight of the quaint little figures. Then Jeanne dressed up like a fairy, and pretended to turn Hugh into a guinea-pig, and they got Nibble up into the nursery, and Hugh hid in a cupboard, and tried to make his voice sound as if it came from Nibble, and the effect of his ventriloquism was so comical that the children laughed till they actually rolled on the floor. And they had hardly got over the laughing--though Marcelline did her best to make them sit still for half an hour or so before going to bed--when it was time to say good-night and compose themselves to sleep."
122,"""I shan't be able to go to sleep for ever so long,"" said Hugh; ""I shall stay awake all the night, I believe."""
123,"""Oh no, you won't,"" said Marcelline, with a smile, as she went off with the light."
124,"And strange to say, hardly had she shut the door when Hugh did fall asleep--soundly asleep. He knew no more about who he was, or where he was, or anything--he just slept as soundly as a little top, without dreaming or starting in the least, for--dear me, I don't know for how long!--any way it must have been for several hours, when--in the strange sudden way in which once or twice before it had happened to him to awake in this curious tapestry room, he opened his eyes as if startled by an electric shock, and gazed out before him, as much awake as if he had never been asleep in his life."
125,"What had awakened him, and what did he see? He could hardly have told what had awakened him but for what he _now_ saw and heard. A voice, a very well-known little voice, was speaking to him. ""Chéri dear,"" it said, ""Chéri, I have come for you. And see what I have got for you."" And there before him stood little Jeanne--but Jeanne as he had never seen her before. She seemed all glistening and shining--her dress was of some kind of sparkling white, and round her waist was a lovely silver girdle--her sleeves too were looped up with silver bands, and, prettiest of all, two snow-white wings were fastened to her shoulders. She looked like a fairy queen, or like a silvery bird turned into a little girl. And in her hand she held another pair of wings exactly like her own."
126,Hugh gazed at her.
127,"""Have you been dressing up?"" he said, ""and in the middle of the night? oh how funny! But O, Jeanne, how pretty you look!"""
128,"Jeanne laughed merrily. ""Come, get up quick, then,"" she said, ""and I'll make you pretty too. Only I can't promise you a head-dress like mine, Chéri."""
129,"She gave her head a little toss, which made Hugh look at it. And now he noticed that on it she wore something very funny indeed, which at first, being black--for Jeanne's hair, you know, was black too--had not caught his attention. At first he thought it was some kind of black silk hood or cap, such as he had seen worn by some of the peasants in Switzerland, but looking again--no, it was nothing of the kind--the head-dress had a head of its own, and as Hugh stared, it cocked it pertly on one side in a way Hugh would have known again anywhere. Yes, it was Dudu, sitting on Jeanne's smooth little head as comfortably as if he had always been intended to serve the purpose of a bonnet."
130,"""Dudu!"" exclaimed Hugh."
131,"""Of course,"" said Jeanne. ""You didn't suppose we could have gone without him, Chéri."""
132,"""Gone where?"" said Hugh, quite sitting up in bed by this time, but still a good deal puzzled."
133,"""Up into the tapestry castle,"" said Jeanne, ""where we've been wishing so to go, though we had to wait for the moonlight, you know."""
134,"The word made Hugh glance towards the window, for, for the first time he began to wonder how it was his room was so bright. Yes, it was streaming in, in a beautiful flood, and the tapestry on the walls had taken again the lovely tints which by daylight were no longer visible."
135,"Hugh sprang out of bed. ""Are these for me?"" he said, touching the wings which Jeanne held."
136,"""Certainly,"" she replied. ""Aren't they pretty? Much nicer than your wall-climbers, Chéri. I chose them. Turn round and let me put them on."""
137,"She slipped them over his head--they seemed to be fastened to a band, and in a moment they had fitted themselves perfectly into their place. They were so light that Hugh was hardly conscious of them, and yet he could move them about--backwards and forwards, swiftly or slowly, just as he chose--and as easily as he could move his arms. Hugh was extremely pleased with them, but he looked at his little night-gown with sudden dismay."
138,"""You said you'd make me look pretty too, Jeanne,"" he observed. ""I don't care for myself--boys never care about being grandly dressed--but I shall look rather funny beside you, shan't I?"""
139,"""Wait a minute,"" said Jeanne, ""you're not ready yet. I'm going to powder you. Shut your eyes."""
140,"He did so, and therefore could not see what Jeanne did, but he felt a sort of soft puff fly all over him, and opening his eyes again at Jeanne's bidding, saw, to his amazement, that he too was now dressed in the same pretty shiny stuff as his little cousin. They looked just like two Christmas angels on the top of a frosted Twelfth Night cake."
141,"""There now,"" said Jeanne, ""aren't you pleased? You don't know how nice you look. Now, Dudu we're quite ready. Are we to fly up to the castle?"""
142,"Dudu nodded his wise head. Jeanne took Hugh's hand, and without Hugh's quite knowing how it was managed, they all flew up the wall together, and found themselves standing on the castle terrace. There was no light streaming out from the windows this time, and the peacocks were quite motionless at their post."
143,"""Are they asleep?"" said Hugh."
144,"""Perhaps,"" said Dudu, speaking for the first time. ""They lead a monotonous life, you see. But there is no occasion to disturb them."""
145,"They were standing just in front of the door, by which, the last time, Hugh had entered the long lighted-up passage. As they stood waiting, the door slowly opened, but to Hugh's great surprise the inside was perfectly different. A very large white-painted hall was revealed to them. The ceiling was arched, and looking up, it seemed so very high, that it gave one more the feeling of being the sky than the roof of a house. This great hall was perfectly empty, but yet it did not feel chilly, and a faint pleasant perfume stole through it, as if not far off sweet-scented flowers and plants were growing."
146,"Hugh and Jeanne stood hand-in-hand and looked around them. The door by which they had entered had closed noiselessly, and when they turned to see the way by which they had come in, no sign of a door was there. In the panels of white wood which formed the walls, it was somehow concealed."
147,"""How shall we ever get out again?"" said Hugh."
148,But Jeanne only laughed.
149,"""We needn't trouble about that,"" she said. ""We got back all right the last time. What I want to know is what are we to do next? I see no way out of this hall, and though it's rather nice, it's not very amusing. Dudu, I wish you would sit still--you keep giving little juggles on my head that are very uncomfortable, and make me feel as if I had a hat on that was always tumbling off."""
150,"""I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle Jeanne,"" replied Dudu with great dignity. ""You really do say such foolish things sometimes that it is impossible to restrain one's feelings altogether. No way out of this hall, do you say, when it is the entrance to everywhere?"""
151,"""But how are we to get to everywhere, or anywhere?"" asked Jeanne."
152,"""Really!"" said Dudu, as if quite out of patience. ""When you are running up and down the terrace, in your other life, you don't stand still at one end and say, 'Dudu, how am I to get to the other?' You move your feet, which were given you for the purpose. And in present circumstances, instead of your feet, you naturally----"""
153,"""Move our wings,"" cried Jeanne. ""Oh, of course. We're to fly. But you see, Dudu, we're accustomed to having feet, and to running and walking with them, but having wings is something new."""
154,"Dudu still looked rather contemptuous, and Hugh gave a little pull to Jeanne's hand."
155,"""Let's set off,"" he said."
156,"""But where are we to go to?"" asked Jeanne."
157,"Dudu gave a little croak. ""Really,"" he said again. ""What am I here for?"""
158,"""Oh, to show us the way, of course,"" said Jeanne. ""You're going to steer us, I suppose, on the top of my head. Well, we're quite ready."""
159,"Off they set. The flying this time was really quite a pleasure in itself, and the higher up they rose the easier and swifter it seemed to become. The hall was lighted from the roof--at least the light seemed to come down from among the arches so high up that their form was only vaguely seen. But whether it was daylight or what, the children did not know, and perhaps it did not occur to them to think. They just flew softly on, till suddenly Dudu veered to one side and stopped them in front of a low carved door with a step before it just large enough for them to stand on. They had not noticed this door before--the hall was so very large and the door in comparison so small, and the step before it had looked just like a little jutting-out ledge in the carving, till they were close to it."
160,"""Don't turn round,"" said Dudu, ""for fear it should make you giddy. Push the door and go in at once."""
161,"The children did so. The door yielded, and then immediately--they were such well-behaved doors in the tapestry palace--closed behind them. And what the children now saw was a small winding stair, the lowest steps of which were close to their feet."
162,"""Here,"" said Dudu, ""I will leave you. You can't go wrong."""
163,"He flew down from Jeanne's head as he spoke. Jeanne gave her head a little shake; she seemed not altogether sorry to be freed from her head-dress, for a head-dress with _feelings_ is a somewhat uncomfortable affair."
164,"""I don't mind you getting off my head, Dudu,"" she said. ""But you might take a turn on Chéri's for a change. I think it's rather shabby of you to leave us already."""
165,"Hugh looked at Jeanne in surprise. He could not understand how it was that Jeanne ventured to speak so coolly to the raven--she who in their daylight life was so frightened of him that she would hardly go near him for fear he should turn her into a mouse, or in some other way bewitch her!"
166,"""I think it's very good-natured of Monsieur Dudu to have come with us so far,"" he said. ""We could never have got into the tapestry castle at all but for him."""
167,"""No,"" said Dudu, ""that you certainly wouldn't."" But he didn't seem offended. ""Good-bye,"" he said, ""and if you're in any trouble remember the former arrangement. Whistle three times."""
168,"""Good-bye,"" said Hugh and Jeanne. But as they said it, their looks met each other in astonishment--there was no Dudu there--he had already disappeared."
169,"""What a queer way he has of going off all of a sudden,"" said Jeanne."
170,"""And what are we to do now?"" said Hugh."
171,"""Go up the stairs, of course, till we find where they lead to,"" said Jeanne."
172,"""It will be rather awkward with our wings,"" said Hugh. ""The stair is so very narrow and twisting."""
173,Jeanne made an exclamation.
174,"""Wings!"" she said. ""Why, Chéri, your wings are gone!"""
175,"""And so are yours!"" said Hugh."
176,"Both the children stared at each other and turned round to look at their shoulders, as if they could hardly believe it."
177,"""It's too bad,"" said Jeanne. ""It's all Dudu."""
178,"""Never mind,"" said Hugh. ""He wouldn't have taken them away if we had been going to need them again; and really, Jeanne, the more I think of it the more sure I am we could never have got up that stair with our wings on."""
179,"""Perhaps not,"" said Jeanne. ""Any way _I_ couldn't have got up it with Dudu on my head. But let's go on, Chéri. Are you frightened? I'm not a bit."""
180,"""I'm not, either,"" said Hugh. ""Still, it's a very queer place. I wish Dudu, or Houpet, or some of them, had come with us!"""
181,"They set off on their climb up the steep spiral staircase. So narrow it was, that going hand-in-hand was out of the question."
182,"""It's worse than the staircase down to the frogs' country,"" said Jeanne."
183,Hugh looked at her triumphantly.
184,"""There now, Jeanne, you _do_ remember,"" he said. ""I believe it was just pretence your saying you thought I had dreamt it all."""
185,"""No,"" said Jeanne, ""it wasn't. You don't understand, Chéri. I'm moonlight Jeanne, now--when we were having the dolls' feast I was daylight Jeanne. And you know it's never moonlight in the day-time."""
186,"""Well, certainly, I _don't_ understand,"" said Hugh. ""And one thing particularly--how is it that in the moon-time you remember about the day-time, if in the day you forget all about the other."""
187,"""I don't exactly forget,"" said Jeanne, ""but it spoils things to mix them together. And lots of things would be _quite_ spoilt if you took them into the regular daylight. I fancy, too, one can see farther in the moonlight--one can see more ways."""
188,"She was standing at the foot of the stair, a step or two higher than Hugh, and the soft light, which still, in some mysterious way, seemed to come down from above--though, looking up the spiral stair, its top seemed lost in gloom--fell on her pretty little face. Her hair had fallen back over her shoulders and lay dark on her pure white shiny dress; there was a look in her eyes which Hugh had never noticed before, as if she could see a long way off. Hugh looked at her earnestly."
189,"""Jeanne,"" he said, ""you're a perfect puzzle. I do wonder whether you're half a fairy, or an angel, or a dream. I do hope you're not a dream when you're in the moonlight. But, oh dear, I cannot understand."""
190,"""Do leave off trying to understand, Chéri,"" said Jeanne, ""and let us amuse ourselves. I always love _you_, Chéri, whatever I am, don't I?"""
191,"She turned towards him brightly, with such a merry smile on her face that Hugh could not help smiling too."
192,"""Do let us go on quickly,"" she said; ""I do so want to see where this stair goes to."""
193,"""Let me go first. I'm a boy, you know, and it's right I should go first in case of meeting anything that might frighten you,"" said Hugh."
194,"So he stepped up in front of Jeanne, and they slowly made their way."
195,"It was impossible to go fast. Never was there such a twisty little stair. Here and there, too, it got darker, so that they could only just find their way, step by step. And it really seemed as if they had climbed a very long way, when from above came faintly and softly the sound of a plaintive ""mew."" ""Mew, mew,"" it said again, whoever the ""it"" was, and then stopped."
196,The children looked at each other.
197,"""Cats!"" they said at the same instant."
198,"""It's just as well,"" said Hugh, ""that none of the animals did come with us, as so many of them are birds."""
199,"Another step or two and the mystery was explained. They had reached the top of the turret stair; it led them into a little hall, all, like the great hall below, painted white. It looked perfectly pure and clean, as if it had only been painted the day before, and yet there was a curiously _old_ look about it too, and a faint scent of dried rose leaves seemed to be in the air."
200,"There was a door in this little hall, exactly opposite the top of the stair, and at each side of the door was an arm-chair, also all white, and with a white satin cushion instead of a seat. And on each of these chairs sat a most beautiful white cat. The only colour in the hall was the flash of their green eyes, as they turned them full on the two children."
201,Jeanne crept a little closer to Hugh. But there was no reason for fear. The cats were most amiably disposed.
202,"""Mew!"" said the one on the right-hand chair."
203,"""Mew!"" said the one on the left-hand chair."
204,"Then they looked at each other for a moment, and at last, seeming to have made up their minds, each held out his right paw. Something in the way they did it reminded Hugh and Jeanne of Dudu when he stood on one leg, and stuck out the other like a walking-stick."
205,"""Mew!"" they said again, both together this time. And then in a clear, though rather mewey voice, the right-hand cat spoke to the children."
206,"""Madame is expecting you,"" he said."
207,"The children did not know what else to say, so they said, ""Thank you."""
208,"""She has been waiting a good while,"" said the left-hand cat."
209,"""I'm very sorry to have kept her waiting,"" said Hugh, feeling Jeanne nudge him. ""I hope she has not been waiting very long?"""
210,"""Oh no,"" said the right-hand cat, ""not long; not above three hundred years."""
211,Jeanne gave a start of astonishment.
212,"""Three hundred----"" ""years,"" she was going to say, but the left-hand cat interrupted her."
213,"""You are not to be surprised,"" he said, very hastily, and Jeanne could not quite make out if he was frightened or angry, or a little of both. ""You must not _think_ of being surprised. Nobody is ever surprised here."""
214,"""No one is ever surprised here,"" repeated the right-hand cat. ""This is the Castle of Whiteness, you know. You are sure you have nothing coloured about you?"" he added, anxiously."
215,Instinctively both the children put their hands up to their heads.
216,"""Only our hair,"" they said."
217,"""Mine's light-brown, you see,"" said Hugh."
218,"""And mine's bl----"" Jeanne was saying, but the cats, both speaking together this time, stopped her with a squeal of horror."
219,"""Oh, oh, oh!"" they said. ""Where are your manners? You must never mention such a word. Your hair, Mademoiselle, is _shadowy_. That is the proper expression."""
220,"Jeanne was annoyed, and did not speak. Hugh felt himself bound to defend her from the charge of bad manners."
221,"""You needn't be so sharp,"" he said to the cats; ""your eyes are as green as they can be."""
222,"""Green doesn't count,"" said the right-hand cat, coolly."
223,"""And how were we to know that?"" said Hugh."
224,"""I don't know,"" said the left-hand cat."
225,"""Well, but can't you be sensible?"" said Hugh, who didn't feel inclined to give in to two cats."
226,"""Perhaps we might be if we tried,"" said the right-hand cat. ""But----"""
227,A sudden sound interrupted him. It was as if some one had moved a piece of furniture with squeaking castors.
228,"""Madame's turning her wheel,"" said the left-hand cat. ""Now's the time."""
229,"Both cats got down from their chairs, and each, standing on their hind legs, proceeded to open his side of the door between the chairs--or ""doors"" I should almost say, for it was a double-hinged one, opening in the middle, and the funny thing about it was that one side opened outwards, and the other inwards, so that at first, unless you were standing just exactly in the middle, you did not see very clearly into the inside."
