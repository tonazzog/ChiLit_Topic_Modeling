1,CHAPTER IV. THE FOREST OF THE RAINBOWS.
2,"          ""Rose and amethyst, gold and grey.""                                    ""ONCE."""
3," Hugh felt rather offended. It was natural that he should do so, I think. At least I am sure that in his place I too should have felt hurt. He had said nothing to make the raven speak in that disagreeably sarcastic way."
4,"""I wish Jeanne were here,"" he said to himself; ""she would think of something to put him down a little."""
5,"But aloud he said nothing, so, great was his surprise, when the raven coolly remarked in answer to his unspoken thoughts,"
6,"""So Jeanne could put me down, you think? I confess, I don't agree with you. However, never mind about that. We shall be very good friends in time. And now, how about visiting the castle?"""
7,"""I should like to go,"" replied Hugh, thinking it wiser, all things considered, to get over his offended feelings. ""I should like to see the castle very much, though I should have liked Jeanne to be with me; but still,"" he went on, reflecting that Jeanne would be extremely disappointed if he did not make the most of his present opportunity, such as it was, ""if you will be so kind as to show me the way, Monsieur Dudu, I'd like to go, and then, any way, I can tell Jeanne all about it."""
8,"""I cannot exactly show you the way,"" said the raven, ""I am only the guardian on this side. But if you will attend to what I say, you will get on very well. Here, in the first place, is a pair of wall-climbers to put on your feet."""
9,"He held out his claw, on the end of which hung, by a narrow ribbon, two round little cushions about the size of a macaroon biscuit. Hugh took them, and examined them curiously. They were soft and elastic, what Hugh in his own words would have described as ""blobby."" They seemed to be made of some stuff like indiarubber, and were just the colour of his skin."
10,"""What funny things!"" said Hugh."
11,"""They are made after the pattern of the fly's wall-climbers,"" remarked the raven. ""Put them on--tie them on, that is to say, so that they will be just in the middle of your foot, underneath of course. That's right; now jump out of bed and follow me,"" and before Hugh knew what he was doing he found himself walking with the greatest ease straight up the wall to where the long flight of steps to the tapestry castle began. On the lowest steps the raven stopped a moment."
12,"""Shall I take them off now?"" asked Hugh. ""I don't need them to walk up steps with."""
13,"""Take them off?"" said the raven; ""oh dear no. When you don't need them they won't incommode you, and they'll be all ready for the next time. Besides, though it mayn't seem so to you, these steps are not so easy to get up as you think. At least they wouldn't be without the wall-climbers."""
14,"_With_ them, however, nothing could have been easier. Hugh found himself in no time at the top of the flight of steps in front of the door from which the raven had come out. The peacocks, now he was close to them, seemed to him larger than ordinary peacocks, but the brilliant colours of their feathers, which he had noticed in the bright moonlight, had disappeared. It was light enough for him to distinguish their figures, but that was all."
15,"""I must leave you now,"" said the raven; ""but you will get on very well. Only remember these two things--don't be impatient, and don't take off your wall-climbers; and if you are very much at a loss about anything, call me."""
16,"""How shall I call you?"" asked Hugh."
17,"""Whistle softly three times. Now, I think it is time to light up. Peacocks."""
18,"The peacocks, one on each side of the door, came forward solemnly, saluting the raven with the greatest respect."
19,"""Ring,"" said the raven, and to Hugh's surprise each peacock lifted up a claw, and taking hold of a bell-rope, of which there were two, one on each side of the door, pulled them vigorously. No sound ensued, but at the instant there burst forth the same soft yet brilliant light which had so delighted Hugh when he first awoke, and which he now discovered to come not from the moon, still shining in gently at the window of the tapestry room down below, but from those of the castle at whose door he was standing. He had never before noticed how many windows it had. Jeanne and he had only remarked the door at the top of the steps, but now the light which flowed out from above him was so clear and brilliant that it seemed as if the whole castle must be transparent. Hugh stood in eager expectation of what was to happen next, and was on the point of speaking to the raven, standing, as he thought, beside him, when a sudden sound made him turn round. It was that of the castle door opening, and at the same moment the two peacocks, coming forward, pushed him gently, one at each side, so that Hugh found himself obliged to enter. He was by no means unwilling to do so, but he gave one last look round for his conductor. He was gone."
20,For about half a second Hugh felt a little frightened and bewildered.
21,"""I wish Dudu had come with me,"" he said. But almost before he had time to think the wish, what he saw before him so absorbed his attention that he forgot everything else."
22,"It was a long, long passage, high in the roof, though narrow of course in comparison with its length, but wide enough for Hugh--for Hugh and Jeanne hand-in-hand even--to walk along with perfect comfort and great satisfaction, for oh, it was so prettily lighted up! You have, I daresay, children, often admired in London or Paris, or some great town, the rows of gas lamps lighting up at night miles of some very long street. Fancy those lights infinitely brighter and clearer, and yet softer than any lamps you ever saw, and each one of a different colour, from the richest crimson to the softest pale blue, and you will have some idea how pretty the long corridor before him looked to Hugh. He stepped along delightedly, as well he might. ""Why, this of itself is worth staying awake ever so many nights to see,"" he said to himself; ""only I do wish Jeanne were with me."""
23,"Where did the corridor lead to? He ran on and on for some time without thinking much about this, so interested was he in observing the lamps and the pretty way in which the tints were arranged; but after a while he began to find it a little monotonous, especially when he noticed that at long intervals the colours repeated themselves, the succession of shades beginning again from time to time."
24,"""I shall learn them by heart if I go on here much longer,"" thought Hugh. ""I think I'll sit down a little to rest. Not that I feel tired of walking, but I may as well sit down a little."""
25,"He did so--on the ground, there was nothing else to sit on--and then a very queer thing happened. The lamps took to moving instead of him, so that when he looked up at them the impression was just the same as when he himself had been running along. The colours succeeded each other in the same order, and Hugh began to wonder whether his eyes were not deceiving him in some queer way."
26,"""Anyhow, I'll run on a little farther,"" he said to himself, ""and if I don't come to the end of this passage soon, I'll run back again to the other end. It feels just as if I had got inside a kaleidoscope."""
27,"He hastened on, and was beginning really to think of turning back again and running the other way, when, all of a sudden--everything in this queer tapestry world he had got into seemed to happen all of a sudden--a little bell was heard to ring, clear and silvery, but not very loud, and in another instant--oh dear!--all the pretty coloured lamps were extinguished, and poor Hugh was left standing all in the dark. Where he was he did not know, what to do he did not know; had he not been eight years old on his last birthday I almost think he would have begun to cry. He felt, too, all of a sudden so cold, even though before he had got out of bed he had taken the precaution to put on his red flannel dressing-gown, and till now had felt quite pleasantly warm. It was only for half a moment, however, that the idea of crying came over him."
28,"""I'm very glad poor little Jeanne isn't here,"" he said to himself by way of keeping up his own courage; ""she _would_ have been afraid. But as I'm a boy it doesn't matter. I'll just try to find my way all the same. I suppose it's some trick of that Dudu's."""
29,"He felt his way along bravely for a few minutes, and more bravely still was forcing back his tears, when a sound caught his ears. It was a cock's crow, sharp and shrill, but yet sounding as if outside the place where he was. Still it greatly encouraged Hugh, who continued to make his way on in the dark, much pleased to find that the farther he got the nearer and clearer sounded the crow, repeated every few seconds. And at last he found himself at the end of the passage--he knew it must be so, for in front of him the way was barred, and _quite_ close to him now apparently, sounded the cock's shrill call. He pushed and pulled--for some time in vain. If there were a door at this end of the passage, as surely there must be--who would make a passage and hang it so beautifully with lamps if it were to lead to nowhere?--it was a door of which the handle was very difficult to find."
30,"""Oh dear!"" exclaimed Hugh, half in despair, ""what shall I do?"""
31,"""Kurroo--kurroorulloo,"" sounded the cock's crow. ""Try again,"" it seemed to say, encouragingly. And at last Hugh's hand came in contact with a little round knob, and as he touched it, all at once everything about him was lighted up again with the same clear, lovely light coming from the thousands of lamps down the long corridor behind him. But Hugh never turned to look at them--what he saw in front of him was so delightful and surprising."
32,"The door had opened, Hugh found himself standing at the top of two or three steps, which apparently were the back approach to the strange long passage which he had entered from the tapestry room. Outside it was light too, but not with the wonderful bright radiance that had streamed out from the castle at the other side. Here it was just very soft, very clear moonlight. There were trees before him--almost it seemed as if he were standing at the entrance of a forest. But, strange to say, they were not winter trees, such as he had left behind him in the garden of Jeanne's house--bare and leafless, or if covered at all, covered only with their Christmas dress of snow and icicles--these trees were clothed with the loveliest foliage, fresh and green and feathery, which no winter's storms or nipping frosts had ever come near to blight. And in the little space between the door where Hugh stood and these wonderful trees was drawn up, as if awaiting him, the prettiest, queerest, most delicious little carriage that ever was seen. It was open; the cushions with which it was lined were of rose-coloured plush--not velvet, I think; at least if they _were_ velvet, it was of some marvellous kind that couldn't he rubbed the wrong way, that felt exquisitely smooth and soft whichever way you stroked it; the body of the carriage was shaped something like a cockle-shell; you could lie back in it so beautifully without cricking or straining your neck or shoulders in the least; and there was just room for two. One of these two was already comfortably settled--shall I tell you who it was now, or shall I keep it for a tit-bit at the end when I have quite finished about the carriage? Yes, that will be better. For the funniest things about the carriage have to be told yet. Up on the box, in the coachman's place, you understand, holding with an air of the utmost importance in one claw a pair of yellow silk reins, his tufted head surmounted by a gold-laced livery hat, which, however, must have had a hole in the middle to let the tuft through, for there it was in all its glory waving over the hat like a dragoon's plume, sat, or stood rather, Houpet; while, standing behind, holding on each with one claw to the back of the carriage, like real footmen, were the two other chickens. They, too, had gold-laced hats and an air of solemn propriety, not _quite_ so majestic as Houpet's, for in their case the imposing tuft was wanting, but still very fine of its kind. And who do you think were the horses? for there were two--or, to speak more correctly, there were no horses at all, but in the place where they should have been were harnessed, tandem-fashion, not abreast, Nibble the guinea-pig and Grignan the tortoise! Nibble next to the carriage, Grignan, of all creatures in the world, as leader."
33,"On sight of them Hugh began to laugh, so that he forgot to look more closely at the person in the carriage, whose face he had not yet seen, as it was turned the other way. But the sound of his laughing was too infectious to be resisted--the small figure began to shake all over, and at last could contain itself no longer. With a shout of merriment little Jeanne, for it was she, sprang out of the carriage and threw her arms round Hugh's neck."
34,"""O Chéri,"" she said, ""I _couldn't_ keep quiet any longer, though I wanted to hide my face till you had got into the carriage, and then surprise you. But it was so nice to hear you laugh--I _couldn't_ keep still."""
35,"Hugh felt too utterly astonished to reply. He just stared at Jeanne as if he could not believe his own eyes. And Jeanne did not look surprised at all! That, to Hugh, was the most surprising part of the whole."
36,"""Jeanne!"" he exclaimed, ""you here! Why, Dudu told me you were ever so far away."""
37,"""And so I am,"" replied Jeanne, laughing again, ""and so are you, Chéri. You have no idea how far away you are--miles, and miles, and miles, only in this country they don't have milestones. It's all quite different."""
38,"""How do you mean?"" asked Hugh. ""How do you know all about it? You have never been here before, have you? I couldn't quite understand Dudu--_he_ meant, I think, that it was only your thinking part or your fancying part, that was away."""
39,"Jeanne laughed again, Hugh felt a little impatient."
40,"""_Jeanne_,"" he said, ""do leave off laughing and speak to me. What is this place? and how did you come here? and have you ever been here before?"""
41,"""Yes,"" said Jeanne, ""I think so; but I don't know how I came. And I don't want to do anything but laugh and have fun. Never mind how we came. It's a beautiful country, any way, and did you _ever_ see anything so sweet as the little carriage they've sent for us, and wasn't it nice to see Houpet and all the others?"""
42,"""Yes,"" said Hugh, ""very. But whom do you mean by 'they,' Jeanne?"""
43,"""Oh dear, dear!"" exclaimed Jeanne, ""what a terrible boy you are. Do leave off asking questions, and let us have fun. Look, there are Grignan and the little cochon quite eager to be off. Now, do jump in--we shall have such fun."""
44,"Hugh got in, willingly enough, though still he would have preferred to have some explanation from Jeanne of all the strange things that were happening."
45,"""_Isn't_ it nice?"" said Jeanne, when they had both nestled down among the delicious soft cushions of the carriage."
46,"""Yes,"" said Hugh, ""it's very nice _now_, but it wasn't very nice when I was all alone in the dark in that long passage. As you seem to know all about everything, Jeanne, I suppose you know about that."""
47,"He spoke rather, just a very little, grumpily, but Jeanne, rather to his surprise, did not laugh at him this time. Instead, she looked up in his face earnestly, with a strange deep look in her eyes."
48,"""I think very often we have to find our way in the dark,"" she said dreamily. ""I think I remember about that. But,"" she went on, with a complete change of voice, her eyes dancing merrily as if they had never looked grave in their life, ""it's not dark now, Chéri, and it's going to be ever so bright. Just look at the lovely moon through the trees. Do let us go now. Gee-up, gee-up, crack your whip, Houpet, and make them gallop as fast as you can."""
49,"Off they set--they went nice and fast certainly, but not so fast but that the children could admire the beautiful feathery foliage as they passed. They drove through the forest--for the trees that Hugh had so admired were those of a forest--on and on, swiftly but yet smoothly; never in his life had Hugh felt any motion so delightful."
50,"""_What_ a good coachman Houpet is!"" exclaimed Hugh. ""I never should have thought he could drive so well. How does he know the road, Jeanne?"""
51,"""There isn't any road, so he doesn't need to know it,"" said Jeanne. ""Look before you, Chéri. You see there is no road. It makes itself as we go, so we can't go wrong."""
52,"Hugh looked straight before him. It was as Jeanne had said. The trees grew thick and close in front, only dividing--melting away like a mist--as the quaint little carriage approached them."
53,Hugh looked at them with fresh surprise.
54,"""Are they not real trees?"" he said."
55,"""Of course they are,"" said Jeanne. ""Now they're beginning to change; that shows we are getting to the middle of the forest. Look, look, Chéri!"""
56,"Hugh ""looked"" with all his eyes. What Jeanne called ""changing"" was a very wonderful process. The trees, which hitherto had been of a very bright, delicate green, began gradually to pale in colour, becoming first greenish-yellow, then canary colour, then down to the purest white. And from white they grew into silver, sparkling like innumerable diamonds, and then slowly altered into a sort of silver-grey, gradually rising into grey-blue, then into a more purple-blue, till they reached the richest corn-flower shade. Then began another series of lessening shades, which again, passing through a boundary line of gold, rose by indescribable degrees to deep yet brilliant crimson. It would be impossible to name all the variations through which they passed. I use the names of the colours and shades which are familiar to you, children, but the very naming any shade gives an unfair idea of the marvellous delicacy with which one tint melted into another,--as well try to divide and mark off the hues of a dove's breast, or of the sky at sunset. And all the time the trees themselves were of the same form and foliage as at first, the leaves--or fronds I feel inclined to call them, for they were more like very, very delicate ferns or ferny grass than leaves--with which each branch was luxuriantly clothed, seeming to bathe themselves in each new colour as the petals of a flower welcome a flood of brilliant sunshine."
57,"""Oh, how pretty!"" said Hugh, with a deep sigh of pleasure. ""It is like the lamps, only much prettier. I think, Jeanne, this must be the country of pretty colours."""
58,"""This forest is called the Forest of the Rainbows. I know _that_,"" said Jeanne. ""But I don't think they call this the country of pretty colours, Chéri. You see it is the country of so many pretty things. If we lived in it always, we should never see the end of the beautiful things there are. Only----"""
59,"""Only what?"" asked Hugh."
60,"""I don't think it would be a good plan to live in it _always_. Just sometimes is best, I think. Either the things wouldn't be so pretty, or our eyes wouldn't see them so well after a while. But see, Chéri, the trees are growing common-coloured again, and Houpet is stopping. We must have got to the end of the Forest of the Rainbows."""
61,"""And where shall we be going to now?"" asked Hugh. ""Must we get out, do you think, Jeanne? Oh, listen, I hear the sound of water! Do you hear it, Jeanne? There must be a river near here. I wish the moonlight was a little brighter. Now that the trees don't shine, it seems quite dull. But oh, how plainly I hear the water. Listen, Jeanne, don't you hear it too?"""
62,"""Yes,"" said Jeanne. ""It must be----"" but before she had time to say more they suddenly came out of the enchanted forest; in an instant every trace of the feathery trees had disappeared. Houpet pulled up his steeds, the two chickens got down from behind, and stood one on each side of the carriage door, waiting apparently for their master and mistress to descend. And plainer and nearer than before came the sound of fast-rushing water."
63,"""You see we are to get down,"" said Hugh."
64,"""Yes,"" said Jeanne again, looking round her a little timidly. ""Chéri, do you know, I feel just a very, very little bit frightened. It is such a queer place, and I don't know what we should do. Don't you think we'd better ask Houpet to take us back again?"""
65,"""Oh no,"" said Hugh. ""I'm sure we'll be all right. You said you wanted to have some fun, Jeanne, and you seemed to know all about it. You needn't be frightened with _me_, Jeanne."""
66,"""No, of course not,"" said Jeanne, quite brightly again; ""but let us stand up a minute, Hugh, before we get out of the carriage, and look all about us. _Isn't_ it a queer place?"""
67,"""It"" was a wide, far-stretching plain, over which the moonlight shone softly. Far or near not a shrub or tree was to be seen, yet it was not like a desert, for the ground was entirely covered with most beautiful moss, so fresh and green, even by the moonlight, that it was difficult to believe the hot sunshine had ever glared upon it. And here and there, all over this great plain--all over it, at least, as far as the children could see--rose suddenly from the ground innumerable jets of water, not so much like fountains as like little waterfalls turned the wrong way; they rushed upwards with such surprising force and noise, and fell to the earth again in numberless tiny threads much more gently and softly than they left it."
68,"""It seems as if somebody must be shooting them up with a gun, doesn't it?"" said Hugh. ""I never saw such queer fountains."""
69,"""Let's go and look at them close,"" said Jeanne, preparing to get down. But before she could do so, Houpet gave a shrill, rather peremptory crow, and Jeanne stopped short in surprise."
70,"""What do you want, Houpet?"" she said."
71,"By way of reply, Houpet hopped down from his box, and in some wonderfully clever way of his own, before the children could see what he was about, had unharnessed Nibble and Grignan. Then the three arranged themselves in a little procession, and drew up a few steps from the side of the carriage where still stood the chicken-footmen. Though they could not speak, there was no mistaking their meaning."
72,"""They're going to show us the way,"" said Hugh; and as he spoke he jumped out of the carriage, and Jeanne after him."
73,[ONWARDS QUIETLY STEPPED THE LITTLE PROCESSION.]
